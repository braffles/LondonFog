\f0\fs28 \cf0 Offer the whole hand. It is an insult, and indicates snobbery, to present two fingers when shaking hands. It is also insulting to return a warm, cordial greeting with a lifeless hand, an evident indifference of manner, when hand-shaking.\
Present a cordial grasp and clasp the hand firmly, shaking it warmly for a period of two or three seconds, and then relinquishing the grasp entirely. It is rude to grasp the hand very tightly or to shake it over-vigorously. To hold it a very long time is often very embarrassing, and is a breach of etiquette.\
In shaking hands, as an evidence of cordiality, regard, and respect, offer the right hand, unless the same be engaged, in which case, apologize, by saying \'93Excuse my left hand.\'94 It is the right hand that carries the sword in time of war, and its extension is emblematic of friendliness in time of peace.}
