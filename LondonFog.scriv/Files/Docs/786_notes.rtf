\f0\fs28 \cf0 Dead London was written as part of a series. The third book in the series, untitled at this point, has yet to be started. However, upon reaching my stretch goal of $25,000, all backers who funded $10.00 or more will receive advanced digital copies of both the second and third books in the series upon completion, and all backers who funded $25.00 or more will also receive a physical copy of the second and third novel upon increasing their pledge by an additional $40.}
