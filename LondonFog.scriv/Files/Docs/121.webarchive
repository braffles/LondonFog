      <p align="left">For much of this century the term <b>Victorian</b>, which 
        literally describes things and events (roughly) in the reign of Queen 
        Victoria, conveyed connotations of "prudish," "repressed," 
        and "old fashioned." Although such associations have some basis 
        in fact, they do not adequately indicate the nature of this complex, paradoxical 
        age that saw great expansion of wealth, power, and culture.</p>
      <p align="left">In science and technology, the Victorians invented the modern 
        idea of invention -- the notion that one can create solutions to problems, 
        that man can create new means of bettering himself and his environment. 
      </p>
      <p>In religion, the Victorians experienced a great age of doubt, the first 
        that called into question institutional Christianity on such a large scale. 
        In literature and the other arts, the Victorians attempted to combine 
        Romantic emphases upon self, emotion, and imagination with Neoclassical 
        ones upon the public role of art and a corollary responsibility of the 
        artist. </p>
      <p>In ideology, politics, and society, the Victorians created astonishing 
        innovation and change: democracy, feminism, unionization of workers, socialism, 
        Marxism, and other modern movements took form. In fact, this age of Darwin, 
        Marx, and Freud appears to be not only the first that experienced modern 
        problems but also the first that attempted modern solutions. Victorian, 
        in other words, can be taken to mean parent of the modern -- and like 
        most powerful parents, it provoked a powerful reaction against itself.</p>
      <p>The Victorian age was not one, not single, simple, or unified, only in 
        part because Victoria's reign lasted so long that it comprised several 
        periods. Above all, it was an age of paradox and power. The Catholicism 
        of the Oxford Movement, the Evangelical movement, the spread of the Broad 
        Church, and the rise of Utilitarianism, socialism, Darwinism, and scientific 
        Agnosticism, were all in their own ways characteristically Victorian; 
        as were the prophetic writings of Carlyle and Ruskin, the criticism of 
        Arnold, and the empirical prose of Darwin and Huxley; as were the fantasy 
        of George MacDonald and the realism of George Eliot and George Bernard 
        Shaw.</p>
      <p>More than anything else what makes Victorians Victorian is their sense 
        of social responsibility. The poet Matthew Arnold refused to reprint his 
        poem "Empedocles on Etna," in which the Greek philosopher throws 
        himself into the volcano, because it set a bad example; and he criticized 
        an Anglican bishop who pointed out mathematical inconsistencies in the 
        Bible not on the grounds that he was wrong, but that for a bishop to point 
        these things out to the general public was irresponsible.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="3"><b>The Victorian Age was characterised by 
        rapid change and developments in nearly every sphere - from advances in 
        medical, scientific and technological knowledge to changes in population 
        growth and location. Over time, this rapid transformation deeply affected 
        the country's mood: an age that began with a confidence and optimism leading 
        to economic boom and prosperity eventually gave way to uncertainty and 
        doubt regarding Britain's place in the world. </b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="3">QUEEN VICTORIA</font></p>
      <p align="left">Born on 24 May 1819. <br>
        On 10th June 1837, following the death of her uncle, William IV, she became 
        queen at the age of eighteen. <br>
        She fell instantly in love with her German cousin, Prince Albert and they 
        were married on 10 February 1840. Between 1841 and 1857 Queen Victoria 
        had nine children - four sons, five daughters. Prince Albert was very 
        interested in art, science and manufacturing and took a keen interest 
        in the building of the Crystal Palace. He died suddenly of typhoid in 
        1861. His widow was overcome with grief and wrote in her diary, "My 
        life as a happy person is ended!" She wore black for the rest of 
        her life. For a long time she refused to appear in public, which made 
        her very unpopular. <br>
        Queen Victoria died aged 80 on 22 January 1901 and a new age - the Edwardian 
        - began. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>IMPERIALISM </p>
      <p>In 1876 Victoria was declared Empress of India and the English Empire 
        was constantly being expanded. The prevailing attitude in Britain was 
        that expansion of British control around the globe was good for everyone. 
      </p>
      <p>One, England had an <i>obligation </i>to enlighten and civilize the 'less 
        fortunate savages' of the world (often referred to as the "White 
        Man's Burden").<br>
        Second, they (as a chosen people) had a destiny to fulfill -- they were 
        'destined' to rule the world. <br>
        Finally, they needed money, resources, labor, and new markets for expanding 
        industry in England. </p>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.victorianweb.org/victorian/history/empire/empireov.html">British 
        Empire</a> (<a href="http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/brit-emp.htm">map</a>) 
        was the largest empire ever, consisting of over 25% of the world's population 
        and area. It included India, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, 
        Rhodesia, Hong Kong, Gibraltar, several islands in the West Indies and 
        various colonies on the African coast. In 1750 the population of Britain 
        was 4 million. By 1851 it was 21 million. By 1900, Queen Victoria reigned 
        over 410 million people. British Victorians were excited by geographical 
        exploration, by the opening up of Africa and Asia to the West, yet were 
        troubled by the intractable Irish situation and humiliated by the failures 
        of the Boer War.<br>
      </p>
      <p>IRISH QUESTION</p>
      <p>This was also the age of the 'Irish Question', the question being whether 
        or not the Irish should be allowed to rule themselves. Gladstone was a 
        constant activist for increased Irish autonomy, but his views were not 
        widely supported, and Irish extremists began a campaign of terrorism, 
        the fruits of which are still with us today.<br>
      </p>
      <p>RELIGION</p>
      <p>Victorian England was a deeply religious country. A great number of people 
        were habitual church-goers, at least once and probably twice, every Sunday. 
        The Bible was frequently and widely read by people of every class; so 
        too were religious stories and allegories<i></i>. Yet towards the end 
        of Queen Victoria's reign, the hold of organized religion upon the English 
        people began to slacken for several reasons.</p>
      <p>EDUCATION</p>
      <p>Education in nineteenth-century England was not equal - not between the 
        sexes, and not between the classes. Gentlemen would be educated at home 
        by a governess or tutor until they were old enough to attend Eton, Harrow, 
        Rugby, Winchester, Westminster, Charterhouse, or a small handful of lesser 
        schools. The curriculum was heavily weighted towards the classics - the 
        languages and literature of Ancient Greece and Rome. After that, they 
        would attend Oxford or Cambridge. Here they might also study mathematics, 
        law, philosophy, and modern history. Oxford tended to produce more Members 
        of Parliament and government officials, while Cambridge leaned more towards 
        the sciences and produced more acclaimed scholars. However, it was not 
        compulsory, either legally or socially, for a gentleman to attend school 
        at all. He could, just as easily, be taught entirely at home. However, 
        public school and University were the great staging grounds for public 
        life, where you made your friends and developed the connections that would 
        aid you later in life. Beau Brummel met the Prince of Wales at Eton and 
        that friendship helped him conquer all of London Society despite his lack 
        of family background. <br>
      </p>
      <p>A lady's education was taken, almost entirely, at home. There were boarding 
        schools, but no University, and the studies were very different. She learned 
        French, drawing, dancing, music, and the use of globes. If the school, 
        or the governess, was interested in teaching any practical skills, she 
        learned plain sewing as well as embroidery, and accounts.</p>
      <p>SCIENCE AND PROGRESS</p>
      <p><font size="3"><a href="http://www.victorianweb.org/victorian/history/hist2.html">Industrial 
        Revolution</a>: the developments that transformed Great Britain, between 
        1750 and 1830, from a largely rural population making a living almost 
        entirely from agriculture to a town-centered society engaged increasingly 
        in factory manufacture. </font></p>
      <p>As many thousands of women throughout rural Britain saw their spinning 
        wheels become redundant and their jobs disappear into the factories, they 
        moved to the cities. The towns offered a better chance of work and higher 
        wages than the countryside, where many families were trapped in dire poverty 
        and seasonal employment. On the other hand, the countryside was healthier. 
      </p>
      <p>The Industrial Revolution gathered steam, and accelerated the migration 
        of the population from country to city. The result of this movement was 
        the development of horrifying slums and cramped row housing in the overcrowded 
        cities. <br>
      </p>
      <p>SOCIAL CLASS</p>
      <p>Working class - men and women who performed physical labor, paid daily 
        or weekly wages</p>
      <p>Middle class - men performed mental or "clean" work, paid monthly 
        or annually</p>
      <p>Upper class - did not work, income came from inherited land and investments<br>
      </p>
      <p>MONEY</p>
      <p>Pounds (Â£)<br>
        Shillings (s.)<br>
        Pence (d.)</p>
      <p>Typical Incomes (annual)</p>
      <p>Aristocrats Â£30,000 <br>
        Merchants, bankers Â£10,000 <br>
        Middle-class (doctors, lawyers, clerks) Â£300-800<br>
        Lower middle-class (head teachers, journalists, shopkeepers, etc.) Â£150-300<br>
        Skilled workers (carpenters, typesetters,etc.) Â£75-100<br>
        Sailors and domestic staff Â£40-75<br>
        Laborers, soldiers Â£25 <br>
      </p>
      <p>DISEASES</p>
      <p>Cholera - caused by human waste in the drinking water.<br>
        Symptoms: nausea, dizziness, vomiting, diarrhea, overwhelming thirst, 
        cramps<br>
        Death often followed within 24 hours of the first symptom</p>
      <p>Consumption - a tuberculosis of the lungs<br>
        Symptoms - weakness, fatigue, wasting away, blood in the lungs<br>
        (killed hundreds of thousands of English in the nineteenth century)</p>
      <p>Typhus - spread by body lice and dirty conditions<br>
        Symptoms: delirium, headaches, rash, high fever<br>
      </p>
      <p>WOMEN AND MEN</p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>In the late industrial era in Britain the ideology of separate spheres 
        which assigned the private sphere to the woman and the public sphere of 
        business, commerce and politics to the man had been widely dispersed. 
        The home was regarded as a haven from the busy and chaotic public world 
        of politics and business, and from the grubby world of the factory. Those 
        who could afford to, created cosy domestic interiors with plush fabrics, 
        heavy curtains and fussy furnishings which effectively cocooned the inhabitants 
        from the world outside. The middle-class household contained concrete 
        expressions of domesticity in the form of servants, dÃ©cor, furnishings, 
        entertainment and clothing. The female body was dressed to emphasise a 
        woman's separation from the world of work. </p>
      <p><i>"The majority of women (happily for them) are not very much troubled 
        with sexual feelings of any kind" - Dr. William Acton</i></p>
      <p>Dr. Acton's books were very popular, and they suggest how much truth 
        there was in our stereotypes of the constrained character of nineteenth-century 
        English sexual behavior. In proper middle-class and upper-class circles, 
        women were supposed to have no sexual conduct before marriage - a hand 
        around the waist, a small kiss, and a fervent pressing of the hand was 
        probably the accepted limit in most cases.</p>
      <p>Also, when a woman married, she had no independent legal status. She 
        had no right to any money (earned, inherited, etc.), she could not make 
        a will or buy property, she had no claim to her children, she had to move 
        with him wherever he went. If the husband died, he could name the mother 
        as the guardian, but he did not have to do so.</p>
      <p>Among the working classes in London, many costermongers (street vendors) 
        lived with their girlfriends starting in their early teens. Elsewhere 
        in the working class, premarital sex was generally winked at, as long 
        as the couple got married.In 1800, about a third of working-class brides 
        were pregnant on their wedding day.</p>
      <p>For middle- and upper-class men, premarital sex would have been with 
        servants and prostitutes, since "nice girls" didn't go beyond 
        the small kiss or squeeze of the hand. </p>
      <p>There were about 80,000 "gay" women (prostitutes) and "fancy 
        men" (pimps) in London in the mid-nineteenth century. They congregated 
        around Covent Garden and in the theater district. They tucked part of 
        their skirts up to indicate their business. They were especially alluring 
        to soldiers, most of whom were forbidden to marry.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>For most of the nineteenth century, homosexuality was punishable by death. 
        However, the last execution on the grounds of "homosexuality" 
        took place in 1830.</p>
