\f0\fs28 \cf0 When Jonathan Grimmer finds evidence that Lord Henry Connor may be a member of the Resurrectionists, a secret society whose scientific pursuits defy ethics, laws, and the natural order of the universe, he is soon dragged into a world of subterfuge, conspiracy, and intrigue. His only allies are criminals and reprobates. Like Annabel Grey, a clever thief with a mechanical eye. Or Parson Sinews, criminal by association, vampire by reputation, and an expert on the subject of murder. Or like Roderick Steen, the famous artist whose keen eyes have made him an asset to Scotland Yard and who solves crime in his spare time.\
Meanwhile, Jonathan's only weapon in a battle to save the city of London from a plague of walking corpses is his airship, The Penny Dreadful. And at the centre of it all is the mysterious Anthony Tidkins, The Resurrection Man, whose gruesome series of murders brought the Resurrectionists into the public eye.}
