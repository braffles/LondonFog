\f0\fs24 \cf0 Notes on Dead London\
\
Should have been writing these up as I went along, sorry, Bryce.\
\
P6-7 - as I mentioned before, I think this could do with a tweak, it doesn't quite feel right\
\
\
\
P16 \'96 much as I love breasts, the description would probably work better as 'that her chest was bound as part of her disguise' as it's a clearer link to why she can't breath freely\
\
P37-38 \'96 hey, absinthe is my potion of choice, no filching ! ;) but if you will, look up absinthe fountains, they're cool\
\
P65-66 \'96 Addresses my issues about why no-one noticed rotting Connor\
\
P67 \'96 did no-one think to ask why the witness wasn't effected like everyone else?\
\
P78-80 \'96 description here clashes with P172\
\
P81-82 End of 81-start of 82 you have a block of three sentences being mostly repeated, you changed your mind but didn't remove the first version\
\
P94 \'96 Where did Lord Connor come from? He was missing wasn't he?\
\
You should stick to dried or gooey brain matter \'96 the descriptions contradict each other, the cop just died but he was dry, others from earlier were gooey?\
\
P158 Social circles, rather than circle?\
\
P172 \'96 being twice her age would have been a big difference to and 8 yr old, and reference to an eight year old not being a prostitute only because she has sticky fingers seems wrong, if you want to use that, she should be at least twelve or thirteen (says he who has his core female character being sold to her father's mates from when she was eleven, but then he was a bastard)\
\
Also, at the end of the page 'from her crime' should be 'for her crime', no?\
\
P199-200 We have more contradictions on the Annabel/Jack backstory, also a boy/father conflict\
\
P200 'hang glider's out of character, 'wings' would work better\
\
P214 'share the rest' may work better than repeating 'everything'?\
\
P215 another reference to hissing air, why? The eye's clockwork isn't it?\
\
P224 made it back to his place, not Roderick's\
\
P238 \'96 'Bathroom as grand as any ballroom'? 'Palace' would work better\
\
P251 \'96 'where she'd hit him' not 'him him'\
\
P280 \'96 2 cannon and a gatling gun ain't even close to a dreadnought 'she's got a sting in her tail' or 'she bites back' would fit a lot better here. Also 'yore's' doesn't work 'yorn' is better\
\
P281- shields over the windows would do nothing to protect the gas bags, something about metallic cloth stopping the bullets would make more sense\

\outl0\strokewidth0   1.    Dead London has elements of horror, adventure, science fiction,\
fantasy, and of course steampunk. I\'92m not sure it\'92s frightening enough to\
call it horror, although there are gory and (possibly) frightening scenes.\
Even the steampunk elements are relatively light. How would you classify\
Dead London\'92s genre?

\pard\pardeftab720
\cf2  \
Genre is a problem for me as I tend to lump many together in my own\
stories. I recently looked up the definition of gaslight, though, and that\
may be the key, gaslight adventure seems to fit it well enough.\

There wasn't anything that I'd classify as that frightening or unsettling, just a little gory in places, but that's normal for zombies, though on a related note, don't forget the rampant homophobia prevalent in the world, especially in many parts of the United States, the blatant scenes with Roderick could lose you some readers.\

Jonathan, most of the way through he was flat and without character, mind you, he was like a pom (limey, Englishman), so that may have been on purpose. It fell flat for me, and he only STARTED to fill out enough to be 'a real boy' towards the end.\

Annabel, partly personal preference as I like strong woman characters, but she's also the central character to me (though you have too many contradictions in her background, and her terror when Connor attacks her is out of character IMHO, that should be timed down to more 'fuk what is this, don't touch me!' than stumbling back in terror and falling over like a normal person)\

\f1 \cf2 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0

Resurrectionists, the zombies wouldn't have been an issue without the lazarus virus that was introduced and developed by them.\

\f0 \cf0 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\outl0\strokewidth0 6.    The "reveal" of Annabel's prosthetic arm is meant to be a\
surprise, both to the reader, and to Jonathan, although there are small\
hints earlier in the novel. Did her mechanical arm come as a surprise to\
you? Was it an effective reveal? 
\f1 \cf2 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0

\pard\pardeftab720

Not really a surprise, but the way it came out was effective for me.\

\f0 \cf0 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\outl0\strokewidth0   7.    As a writer, I have attempted to balance horror and suspense with\
witty conversation and a bit of humour. Were there any moments that had you\
laughing aloud, smiling in appreciation of a character's wit, did you find\
yourself groaning at the poor attempts at humour, or was the humour so\
subtle\'97or perhaps simply not funny\'97as to be missed entirely?\

They got a smile at times, a groan sometimes, humour is one of the hardest parts of this as people's idea of what's funny differs so much, so a mixed reaction is probably best, the parts I thought lame are what others will find funny, or see and laugh at when they missed the more subtle parts I enjoyed.\

a number of the reader\'92s questions unanswered by the end. Were there any\

The only point that I really felt should have had more was Parson's fianc\'e9, you sort of dropped her out there like a turd on the carpet and left everyone stepping around her. I had the impression that she was probably a resurrectionist, but something about finding her name among the dead, seeing her leave with masked men or laughing about Parson's surprise would have given a direction. As it was, she was an unimportant enigma that made little sense.\
