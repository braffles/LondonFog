Finally, Annabel confronts Dr. Simms, who reveals that Jack was the bastard son of Dr. Allen and Mrs. Grimmer, while Jonathan was also born of an affair and is not truly Mrs. Grimmer’s son. Jack’s Dead London plan was concocted to save his dying father, and Mrs. Grimmer was complicit because Jack is her son and Dr. Allen was her lover. She hated Jonathan because he was not her son and reminded her of her husband’s unfaithfulness and the fact that she’d given up her own son while he’d not done the same.

Following this revelation, Annabel and Abraham run into Jack. Annabel puts a bullet in his skull, while the unliving begin to fill the halls of the underground.
