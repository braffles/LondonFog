\f0\fs28 \cf0 Jonathan had many questions. It was difficult to know which one to ask first. Who killed Lord Connor, and why? Why was Parson Sinews blamed for Lord Connor\'92s death, and what have the Resurrectionists done with him? If Lord Connor was himself a Resurrectionist, why did they target him? Why did they unleash the Lazarus Virus at the masquerade? What was Miss Monday hired to steal from him?\
