\f0\fs24 \cf0 Where to begin? For starters, try to find a way to portray Abraham Palmer as the betrayer in their midst. He was playing both sides, pretending to be on Annabel\'92s side only to get her out of the way until the plan could be put in motion.\

Reveal that Dr. Simms\'92 memory loss is not indicative of the serum\'92s effects. The only clear symptom is a physical sign - a discolouration of the skin. This means it\'92s possible for people to conceal that they are brainwashed. In other words, Palmer may have lied.\

Can I still also reveal that Jack\'92s father was really Dr. Allen? Can I reveal that Mrs. Grimmer was his mother? Not sure if possible.}
