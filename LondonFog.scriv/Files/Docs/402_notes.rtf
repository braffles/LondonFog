\f0\fs24 \cf0 Delete this scene. Instead, add a scene in which Dr. Mircalla Karnstein arrives in a hansom, shoots the closest zombie, and orders Roderick to \'93get in.\'94\
\
Claiming to be acting on behalf of the queen, she says that she has been looking for Roderick because the police cannot be trusted, nor can the queen\'92s agents. She offers to hire him, explains a few things that might otherwise have been explained by the Moirae in deleted scenes. She should direct his suspicions towards Annabel and Mr. O while remaining innocent as far as the reader is concerned (only in the sequel will her villainy be revealed). Make her seem like a capable new ally.\
\
Roderick should then be summoned to another murder site, at The Melbourne Club. Karnstein can drop him off there or just let him know that he\'92s been summoned. }
