\f0\fs22 \cf0 So, the reason he rushed out his model was because he had an appointment to investigate a large mass murder?  It just doesn't seem like something one would schedule.  I think it would make more sense if while Roderick was painting his model, he had been interrupted by either a call or someone coming to his home to let him know of the murder so he could investigate.  Then he could rush his subject out the door.}]]></Comment>
