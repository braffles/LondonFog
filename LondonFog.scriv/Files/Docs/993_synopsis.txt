Submission contents: Send a brief (2-3 page) synopsis of your book, plus the first few chapters (approx 3-5 chapters, maximum 10,000 words). Please also put a one-sentence summary of your novel at the top of page one. Don’t forget to include your name and contact details, plus the word count of the finished novel. If the book is the start of a series, tell us (very briefly!) about the following volumes you have planned. If there’s something very notable about you as a person, within the SF/F community or the world at large, feel free to mention it. Put this all in one document, not several.

Submission format: Send everything in one Word or similarly text-based document (a .docx, .doc or .rtf file). Don’t send a PDF. Set it all in a readable, serif typeface common to most computers (eg Times New Roman, Cambria). Set lines to double line-space. Don’t put two spaces after a full stop. Insert a page break between chapters or introductory matter. Don’t obsess, though – as long as we can read it, all will be well.
