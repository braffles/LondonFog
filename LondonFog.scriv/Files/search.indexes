            <Title>Scene 45</Title>
            <Text>Jonathan stared at Palmer in wonder. His knowledge of Anthony Tidkins’ life was astounding. He had thought that Parson Sinews was the foremost expert on the Resurrection Man, but Palmer spoke of Anthony Tidkins’ life with intimate detail. Jonathan knew that his father and Palmer had researched Tidkins for the Grimmer Company’s newspapers, but could they really have learned so much from research alone?
“How do you know all this about Anthony Tidkins?” Jonathan asked.
Palmer looked him in the eye, and with a long, drawn-out sigh, he answered. “Because Anthony Tidkins told me.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene Two</Title>
            <Text>“Apollo loved her, ’till her guilt he knew, while true she was, or whilst he thought her true. But his own bird the raven chanced to find the false one with a secret rival joined.”
“Ovid,” said Roderick Steen with a glance at the Chief Inspector.
“Sorry?”
“It’s a passage from Ovid’s Metamorphoses,” he explained, thrusting a piece of black liquorice into his mouth. He sucked on the candy as he recalled the poem. “The raven tells Apollo of his lover’s infidelity. A tryst with a mortal, if I correctly recall.”
“What does it mean?” Taggert asked.
Roderick gave a shrug.
“Well, I’m just guessing, but I’d say our Apollo here is being taunted from beyond the grave,” he said, looking at the body of with a piteous expression on his face. “His wife was unfaithful.”
A woman had found the body in Hyde Park in the wee hours of the morning and had screamed for the police until someone had come to her aid. The police, sensibly, had called for an expert, and Roderick had eagerly made his way to the scene. He’d been rewarded by arriving in time to hear the corpse reciting poetry.
The horn of a phonograph was hidden in the victim’s mouth for this purpose, rigged so that the message would play as soon as someone touched the body, his lips sewn to pistons and pulleys to provide animation throughout the message, giving off the rudimentary impression that he was speaking aloud. The message would play just the once.
The man’s hands had been removed. They were replaced with the mechanical pieces of a typewriter. His chest had been carved out, his organs surgically removed. What the murderer had done with them, Roderick couldn’t say. His guts were filled with the brass and steel of machinery. The man’s elbows had been sawed off, his upper and lower arms joined again by brass pipes. Metal posts had been driven into the ground and into the man’s legs. Thinner metal rods affixed to the arms allowed the man to stand upright, producing a thin illusion that he was still alive. The murderer would have taken care to complete as much of this work as possible with the victim still alive.
“Any idea who we’re looking at?” asked Taggert.
Roderick considered his reply, looking particularly at the victim’s typewriter hands.
“A newspaper man,” he said thoughtfully. “But the more important question is, who did this to him?”
“Well, you’re the expert, Roderick,” Taggert muttered, twirling his moustache in irritation. “Do you not recognize the handiwork of your nemesis?”
Roderick snorted. Yes, Roderick had been following Dr. Allen’s case since the beginning. It was his expertise that had given the police a suspect in the first place. Until he managed to name Dr. Allen, they’d been chasing a shadow. Now at least, the shadow had a name. But Roderick wasn’t one for leaping to conclusions. Not without first examining the clues.
Roderick noted the size of the footsteps in the muddy grass. They could only have been made by one man.
“The Irish Giant must have been here,” he noted.
And where the Irish Giant went, the doctor was sure to follow.
“So it is Allen?” said the Inspector.
“Possibly,” Roderick replied.
“What do you mean possibly.”
“Possibly. An adverb indicating hesitancy. As in perhaps. Maybe.”
Twirl, twirl, twirl, went Taggert’s moustache.
“I know what possibly means!” He took a deep breath. “Do you really think someone else could have done this?”
Roderick shrugged.
“The doctor might have been having a bad day,” he said, looking once more to the cadaver. “But these incisions are not as clean as usual. On the other hand, the automaton is actually more sophisticated than usual, which might mean that he’s been honing his skill as an engineer, but the surgery is not up to par. It gives me pause, that’s all.”
Twirl, twirl.
Roderick took a step forward. He withdrew, from his pocket, a magnifying glass, and bent down on one knee to get a closer look at the incisions. As he’d said, the cuts were clean, but not up to par with the extreme precision of Dr. Allen’s usual work. He began sorting through the man’s pockets, and managed to procure a business card with the man’s name on it. Charles Grimmer. He showed the card to the inspector. Finding nothing else of import, he gave the body a sniff. It certainly smelt like a dead body. He stood up.
“Then again, the killing does possess all the trademarks of his usual work—including those that have not been publicized—which means that it cannot be the work of a copycat. It may be that the doctor has an accomplice or an apprentice, or it may be that I’m simply overthinking things; it wouldn’t be the first time. The Irish Giant, the phonograph, the disassembly and reassembly of the cadaver, it’s all very Dr. Allen. And yet…”
“It’s been a long time since his last killing,” said the Inspector.
“Yes,” Roderick admitted. “I’m afraid I had begun to hope that we had seen the last of him. It seems I was wrong.”</Text>

            <Text>Quickly, as he was now running abhorrently late, Roderick abandoned his smock and dressed himself. He added a brightly coloured blue ascot to the ensemble, which he complemented with an ivory frock coat with blue buttons and embroidered with silver threads, and a pair of blue kid gloves.
“Best kiss? I’m afraid not even close, my friend,” he said to Bailey. “But let’s not talk about that; I hate to see you jealous.”
He selected a top hat from a rack containing numerous options; he chose one with a hint of violet, placed it upon his head, and checked his reflection in the looking glass. He nodded his approval, snatching up an umbrella from its rack.
“See,” he said, gazing at his reflection. “I don’t look a thing like Sherlock Holmes.”
“I don’t think he was talking about your appearance,” he argued in his Bailey voice. “Most likely he was referring to your work as a detective. Honestly, Roderick, are you incapable of accepting a compliment?”
Roderick gave a sigh of feigned annoyance. “I hate it when you’re so logical, Bailey,” he said. He picked up the dog affectionately and let Bailey nuzzle up against his chest. “You’re right, I suppose. It must have been meant as a compliment. Even so, I loathe the comparison to that imbecile, Holmes.”
Thusly dressed, he took a bit of what he liked to think of as medicinal cocaine, patted Bailey on the head, and headed out into the night.
“Mustn’t keep my driver waiting,” he said. He had an appointment to keep. A hundred men had been murdered this evening, and it looked like the culprit was none other than the nefarious Dr. Allen.</Text>
            <Comments>So, the reason he rushed out his model was because he had an appointment to investigate a large mass murder?  It just doesn't seem like something one would schedule.  I think it would make more sense if while Roderick was painting his model, he had been interrupted by either a call or someone coming to his home to let him know of the murder so he could investigate.  Then he could rush his subject out the door.</Comments>

            <Title>Scene 35</Title>
            <Text>The metal cage disappeared, replacing the missing section of the floor with a solid thump and the whoosh of air. The crease in the floor was just barely visible, and only then because Annabel knew what to look for.
She put her hand on the floor, and ran it along the length of the crease. There was no latch, no dial, nothing to indicate how to turn the elevator on.
She looked around the room. There had to be a switch somewhere, even it was hidden. She scrutinized the office, exploring each inch first with her eyes and then with her hands, picking up this item and putting it down, then picking up that item, looking behind it and putting it back where she’d found it again. Where in the blazes was the switch? She cursed in frustration, fruitlessly picking up books in order to check the wall behind the panel, just as one book suddenly stood out.
A penny dreadful publication called Tales of Dead London. Its author was unnamed, but the name of its publisher was printed along the spine. Grimmer &amp; Grimmer Books. An imprint of the Grimmer and Sons publishing company, Annabel assumed.
Annabel had read some of the stories from the dreadful when she was first learning to read. If she recalled correctly, it had originally been published serially, each issue appearing in a periodical magazine, with a number of different writers continuing to write the stories after its original author passed away. Later, the stories were collected and reprinted in a thick paperback volume of nearly four hundred pages. In the stories, the dead rose from their graves and ate the flesh of the living.
Most of the books on the shelf had been collecting dust. But Tales of Dead London was not the least bit dusty. Which meant that unless it had only recently been added to the library, the book had recently been handled. Annabel picked it up now. As she did, the heavy mechanical sound of revolving gears and gyrating pulleys announced that the elevator had started up again.
She looked to see the floor begin to separate once more, the hidden panel lifting up to reveal the hidden cage into which the elevator would soon rise. In her hand, the book refused to lift from the shelf. It was affixed to the shelf, connected to a lever with little brass screws sticking into its spine. The book was no book at all. It wasn’t even made of paper, she realized with surprise.
Finally, the elevator finished its ascent, and Annabel let go of the book. It snapped back into place with a slight clicking sound.
Annabel opened the door of the cage, and stepped nervously into the elevator. She looked around the inside of the cage for some sort of lever that would operate the machine, and eventually found it. She reached up to pull the lever. She gave a start as the elevator shuddered and began to descend into the dark elevator shaft.</Text>
            <Comments>I like having a book trigger the secret elevator.  It’s a cliche, sure, but it’s one of the best.  I’ve even used it, myself, right down to the clue of the book in question being less dusty.

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>How long had it been since Annabel had seen Anthony Tidkins? There was still a part of her that wanted to run towards him, even now, and put her arms around him. There was another part of her that wanted to put her arms around his throat. That’s family for you though, isn’t it, she thought.
When Annabel first met Anthony Tidkins, she had her hand in his pocket, fishing for change. He wasn’t considerably older than she was, perhaps fifteen, sixteen maybe, while she was nearing nine. He was a gentleman, however, and she was an urchin.
She had been fascinated by him when she first set eyes on him, walking through the streets of London with a parasol above his head. She’d never seen a gentleman with a parasol before, that feminine accessory more regularly used by ladies. His was of a distinctly more masculine design, if such a thing were possible, but it wasn’t the parasol that gave her pause. It was the paleness of his skin, so white she felt that if she squinted she might actually be able to look through him. His eyes were a soft pink colour, his eyelashes long but white as snow. His hair was that wintry white as well, and his body waif-like, thin. Aside from the parasol, he was dressed to the height of fashion, immaculately dressed in dark but rich tones of grey and blue.
She followed him, at first out of mere curiosity. Then as she continued to thread her way through the marketplace, following his footsteps, it occurred to her that he must be absurdly wealthy. She, in a plain and tattered skirt, with brown fingerless gloves and hair knotted and messy, had only one thing to keep her from that other, less dignified form of employment that other girls of her social status often turned to. Sticky fingers.
Now, as the albino stopped to purchase a newspaper, Annabel paid close attention to which pocket housed his coin purse. She followed him a little longer, waiting for the right moment. A horse was milling nearby, its cabriolet parked on the side of the road beside a haberdashery.
As the albino stopped beside the horse to look at some item on display in the shop window, Annabel settled on her game. The horse dodge. Without warning, she violently slapped his hat, causing it to fall over his eyes. While he was busy reclaiming his vision, Annabel was slipping her little fingers into his pocket. She closed them around the pouch and swiftly lifted it from the albino’s pocket.
The pouch caught on something. A chain dangled between pocket and purse. The chain pulled, and the gentleman extricated his hat from his eyes. But before he could react, Annabel loosened the drawstring on the coin purse, dumped its contents into her hand, and dropped the empty purse. It swung, empty, from its chain.
Then she was off, dodging beneath the legs of the horse. The game usually went more smoothly than this. Normally she’d have ducked behind the horse before the unsuspecting gentleman even had the chance to right his hat upon his head. This time, she was forced to flee, back into the crowd of the marketplace. She dove beneath vendors’ carts and weaved through a sea of pedestrian traffic. The chase was her playground, and she’d played this game often enough. She always won. The trick was that she was always the first to start running.
This time was no different, except in one regard; the albino hadn’t even bothered to chase after her. He simply smiled as he watched her flee. When Annabel realised that he wasn’t about to continue chasing her, she opened her palm in order to check on her prize. Her eyes grew big and bright. Such a score! What she held in her tiny palm was more than a year’s salary for a man of modest income.</Text>

            <Title>Scene Two</Title>
            <Text>“Roderick, it’s me!” a man’s voice called from beyond the door.
Bailey yipped and wagged his tail in excitement. Roderick, recognizing the voice, gave a shrug, and headed for the door, deciding not to bother with trousers. Rémy raised his eyebrows, scandalized.
Roderick, ignoring him, opened the door to find an old friend standing outside.
“Jonathan!” he exclaimed happily, greeting his friend with a hug and a kiss on the cheek. Bailey upped the ante by whining with excitement and dancing in circles.
“Roderick,” Jonathan replied, looking a bit embarassed. “I’m sorry to come calling at this hour, and without sending a card.”
Roderick dismissed the apology with a wave of his hand. “Nonsense!” he said. “What use are such formalities among old friends? Come in, make yourself at home. Rémy here was just leaving.”
“I was?” Rémy put in, but with a withering look from Roderick, he picked up the remainder of his things, gave Jonathan a look of furious jealousy, and stormed past him.
Roderick put a hand on Andrew’s hand, halting his progress at the door, and promised that they’d pick up where they left off soon enough. “And I’m not speaking entirely of the painting,” he said with a wink.
Rémy went beet red at that scandalous comment, but he smiled, kissed Roderick once again, this time on the cheek, and left, this time satisfied that Jonathan did not represent competition.
When he’d left, Roderick gave a weary smile and said, “Sorry about that.”
He turned on his heel and swept into his living room, giving Jonathan a glimpse of his posterior. Jonathan made no comment; apparently they’d been friends long enough that Jonathan wasn’t bothered by the view. He lifted a small wooden box from his bookshelf, and offered a sampling of its contents to his friend.
“Is that snuff?” Jonathan wondered.
“Cocaine,” he explained, and put a bit up his nose by way of demonstration. He inhaled sharply and let out a whoop of exhilaration. “Sigmund Freud swears by it, you know. Calls it a magical substance. And indeed it is! Wonderful. No side effects, and not at all addictive—though I can’t seem to give it up,” he added with a laugh. “Are you familiar with Freud, by the way?”
Jonathan indicated that he wasn’t and declined the offer of the magical substance with a wave of his hand. Roderick set the box back on the shelf. He took a seat on the divan, while Jonathan settled into the settee.
“Sarah Bernhardt uses it as well, which—truth be told—was my real reason for giving it a go. Do you know Sarah Bernhardt?” Roderick continued. “Fabulous woman, you simply must meet her. I’ll introduce you, but you must first promise me you won’t fall in love with her. Most men do, it seems, and I’m afraid she’d be a bad influence on you. Given your own reputation, that is saying something.”
“Roderick, I’m afraid this isn’t a social call,” Jonathan said, abruptly putting an end to Roderick’s enthusiasm.
“Oh,” he said, looking at his friend with concern. He quieted, and said gravely, “Oh, I see. In that case, what can I do for you?”
He crossed one leg over the other, patted the empty space on the divan, inviting Bailey to leap up beside him. He scratched his dog’s head and studied his friend’s face for some indication of what had happened.
“Did something happen at the ball?” he asked.
Jonathan’s mouth opened in surprise.
“Yes,” he said.
Roderick listened intently as Jonathan summarized the events of the evening, beginning with the pair of letters that Jonathan believed tied Connor to the Resurrectionists, and ending with his narrow escape through the window of Connor’s mansion. At first, Roderick had felt a guilty sort of glee at his friend’s drama—Lord Connor, Resurrectionist was indeed a dramatic headline—but as the story unfolded, his excitement turned to concern for his friend.
While Roderick had protested that he was an artist, not a detective, the truth was that Roderick had often been called in to advise the police on particularly difficult cases. This arrangement had begun with the theft of an obscure piece of art, Roderick being generally considered an art expert, and had continued when the police had discovered that Roderick’s knowledge was not in any way constrained to the art world. Roderick was a true polymath. Roderick made a study of all things—whatever field of study caught his interest at the moment—and had a near-eidetic memory. Naturally, when a series of gruesome murders made headlines, the police had called on Roderick to help them find the culprit responsible. Roderick had been unable to catch the killer, but he had been useful, at least, in narrowing down the list of subjects. The killer, he had told the police all those years ago, was most likely a member of the secret scientific society known as the Resurrectionists.
Before these murders, there had been a number of rumours going around about a few prominent scientists; none of these rumours were ever proven, and after it came to light that a Resurrectionist was to blame for the series of murders, they went deeper underground. In Roderick’s mind, this only served to confirm their guilt. Frankly, it worried Roderick that they had resurfaced at Connor’s masquerade. More troubling, of course, was that they’d walked in on Jonathan as he’d fled the site of Lord Connor’s death.
“So,” he said, “The Resurrectionists most likely believe that you are responsible for Lord Connor’s death.”
“Yes,” Jonathan said heavily. Roderick was unaccustomed to such gravity in his friend’s voice. He was right to be worried, however.
“I’m sorry to say I don’t have anything good to tell you, as a result. They are likely to come after you. We can only hope that they did not learn your identity.”
“But what do I do, Roderick?” Jonathan pleaded.
Roderick sat back, deep in thought. He ruffled Bailey’s ears. Suddenly, he sat up.
“Simple. We shall simply have to learn the names of each of the Resurrectionists, and turn them in to the police.”
Jonathan let out a guffaw.
“Oh, is that all?” he said, and sighed. “Thanks, Roderick, you do know how to cheer me up. So, there isn’t any hope for me, then? I’m a dead man walking?”
“I’m serious,” said Roderick, seriously. “I know, I know. That doesn’t happen often, but this isn’t something I’d take lightly. We are going to unmask the Resurrectionists, once and for all. Each and every one of them.”
Jonathan gave Roderick a look as if to say, you’re high, and to be fair, he was.
“What else are you going to do? Sit back and wait for them to come after you?” Roderick posited.
Jonathan shrugged. “Fair enough,” he said after a minute. “Where do we start?”
“Ah!” Roderick exclaimed, startling Bailey out of his seat. The terrier began barking. “Ah! Now there’s a good question. Where do we start?” He sat down, suddenly aware that he’d stood up at some point he couldn’t recall. He thought for a moment, then said, “You’ll have to consult an expert, I’m afraid.”
“You’re an expert,” Jonathan countered, as Roderick left his seat again and continued the conversation from his bedroom.
“When I consulted for Scotland Yard on the Resurrectionist murders, I consulted another expert. A fellow eccentric with an exceedingly keen interest in murder. Parson Sinews,” Roderick explained, calling to Jonathan in the sitting room.
He abandoned his smock and began dressing himself. He added a brightly coloured blue ascot to the ensemble, which he complemented with an ivory frock coat with blue buttons and embroidered with silver threads, and a pair of blue kid gloves.
“Sinews is a collector. He keeps broadsides and other memorabilia from famous crime scenes, and visits the sites of all the worst murders. When he can, he arranges to meet with the villains themselves, before they’re sent to the gallows. The more gruesome the murder, the keener his interest. He is said to own a ledger, made from the skin of William Burke. How’s that for ironic? He has a length of the gallows rope used to hang Mary Ann Cotton. Supposedly he has an original Ripper letter in his possession.”
“And you want me to meet this, this, murder enthusiast?” Jonathan called.
“Yes, well, he knows more about the Resurrectionists than anyone else in London, myself included. If we hope to mount a war against them, we’ll need Mr. Sinews’ assistance, I’m afraid.”
He selected a top hat from a rack containing numerous options; he chose one with a hint of violet, placed it upon his head, and checked his reflection in the looking glass. He nodded his approval, snatching up an umbrella from its rack.
“See,” he said, gazing at his reflection and taking up his earlier conversation. “I don’t look a thing like Sherlock Holmes.”
“I don’t think he was talking about your appearance,” he argued in his Bailey voice. “Most likely he was referring to your work as a detective. Honestly, Roderick, are you incapable of accepting a compliment?”
Roderick gave a sigh of feigned annoyance. “I hate it when you’re so logical, Bailey,” he said. He picked up the dog affectionately and let Bailey nuzzle up against his chest. “You’re right, I suppose. It must have been meant as a compliment. Even so, I loathe the comparison to that imbecile, Holmes.”
Thusly dressed, he returned to the sitting room. Jonathan got up.
“We’re not going now, are we? Surely we’ll wait till morning?”
“You’re going now,” Roderick told him. “Mr. Sinews keeps strictly to night hours. If you wait till morning, he’ll be in bed.”
“And I’m to call on him unannounced? You’re not coming with me?”
“I’ll write you a card,” said Roderick. “He’ll be more than happy to receive you, I assure you. You have a gun, by the way?”
Jonathan’s eyebrows went up.
“I do,” he said, alarmed by the question. “Should I expect to need it?”
“No, of course not,” Roderick said with a gentle laugh, “It is loaded, though, yes?”
When Jonathan nodded, Roderick relaxed, and headed for the door. He paused to write up the calling card; he had stationary on the credenza by the door. He pressed the card into Jonathan’s hand.
“Wait, where are you headed? You’re not coming with me?” Jonathan asked.
“I had planned to attend Lord Connor’s masquerade ball, you know, but time got the best of me. It often does, you know? Better late than never, as they say. I’m sure my friend the detective will be there by now. I’ll do my best to make sure your name doesn’t come up in conversation.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene 41</Title>
            <Text>Anthony Tidkins’ was truly a face that only a mother could love. And even she might have preferred him if he’d been pretty. It wasn’t as though he had a hideous disfigurement, an amputation, a scarred face or blemishes. Mostly, what it came down to was a total absence of handsome features.
His chin, average. His eyes, pale. His cheekbones, just so slightly too high. His lips, just a bit too thin. His body, under muscled, weak. Even his smile was imperfect, the gaps between his teeth too wide.
It was mostly that amalgam of subpar features that made him unattractive. But then, as if the universe felt that he had gotten off easy, it had also bestowed upon him another burden of physiognomy. Albinism. If merely being unhandsome wasn’t enough to make him a pariah, his unnaturally white hair, pale skin, pale and rose-hued eyes did the trick. More than that, he also had a heightened sensitivity to sunlight, frail health, and a steadily increasing number of various phobias.
Knowing all this, one might assume that Anthony did not have a happy childhood. This assumption would be wrong. In spite of the odds being stacked against him, Anthony did at least have a few tools at his disposal, which he used to great effect, not to make a great deal of friends, but at least to make a few that were uncommonly loyal. It was not his intelligence, his perspicaciousness, or his curiosity that made him interesting to his loyal circle of friends. Mostly, it was his fearlessness.
One day, sitting on a bench by the Serpentine, watching the ducks waddling on the banks with a few friends, the word freak echoed in the air. A pregnant silence followed, as Anthony Tidkins curled his hand into a fist.
“What did you call me?” he demanded.
The boy sneered. Here was a boy half his size, frail-looking and weird, parasol in hand, dark glasses over his eyes, acting tough.
“You’re gonna fight me?” he said with a laugh.
“Yes,” said Anthony, folding his parasol in preparation for the altercation.
“Don’t,” said one of Anthony’s entourage. Under his breath, his friend whispered a cautionary reminder. “You’ve never won a fight before. Not one.”
Anthony laughed. “Maybe this will be the first,” he said.
It wasn’t. Anthony returned home with a bloody lip and a black eye, soaking wet; he’d been pushed into the Serpentine.
“Let me see your face,” said Mrs. Cartwright in that stern voice of hers. “Have you been fighting again, young man?”
“Yes, ma’am,” he admitted, shamefaced.
“You know I have to let your father know,” she said.
Anthony nodded.
“Yes, Mrs. Cartwright. I understand.”
“Be a good lad and run along to your room,” she said. “I’ll bring your supper up in a minute.”
He nodded and excused himself. He did as she asked, but he left his room open a crack, so he could overhear the conversation when Mrs. Cartwright told Anthony’s father about the fighting. When she did, his father hardly seemed interested.
“Boys will be boys,” he muttered, clearly distracted by something.
Mrs. Cartwright sighed. Through the crack in the door, Anthony saw the conversation unfold.
“I’m busy, Mrs. Cartwright, if you please.”
“Sir,” she said, but Anthony’s father barely looked up.
In some ways, Anthony would have preferred to be punished to being ignored. It had grown worse since his mother passed away a few years earlier. His father saw Anthony as nothing more than a burden.
Anthony quickly hid his face from the crack in the door so he wouldn’t be caught eavesdropping. He sat down on his bed and opened his book, just as Mrs. Cartwright came in.
“What’s that you’re reading?”
“Mysteries of London,” he told her.
“Not another penny dreadful, is it?” she asked. “You know your father doesn’t like you reading that sort of thing.”
Anthony pretended not to hear her, keeping his eyes on the book. Stupid of her to use that, he thought. Anthony knew perfectly well that his father didn’t care what he read, so long as he left his medical books on their shelves.
That was probably the only time Anthony had ever gotten into trouble with his father. He’d stolen his father’s books, and read each and every last one. At first, the scientific terminology and elevated scholarly language was beyond his understanding. But the more he began to read, the more he began to understand, and the more obsessive he became with those books. He had expected his father to praise him for taking an interest in learning. But that was not to be. Now, his father’s books remained behind a locked cabinet, and Anthony was left reading penny dreadfuls.
Mrs. Cartwright threw her hands up and walked out of his room in a huff.
“I give up!” she cried dramatically. “Neither of the men of this house will heed my advice.”</Text>

            <Text>“I suppose it does,” said Miss Monday, standing up stiffly. Her gaze lingered on the poor dead girl’s body with the strange device affixed to it.
“Give me a hand with her, would you? We’ve got to get her back to the Agency. Dr. Simms will need to examine her body and the device attached to it, but this is precisely what we were looking for. A clue. If we can determine who created this monster, it should lead us to Lord Connor’s killer and thus the men who hired you.”
A shadow fell across Mr. O, but Miss Monday was still so focused on the girl’s body that she failed to notice it.
“About that,” she said. “Could we not have simply retrieved Lord Connor’s body and examined that? Shouldn’t his body have contained clues?”
“Mhm,” Mr. O replied, though he was only slightly paying attention. He was attempting to remove the clockwork device from the girl’s body, but the device refused to budge. “Hm. Yes, well, Connor’s body is likely inaccessible. For the moment, anyway. The place is likely swarming with police officers.”
“Ah,” she said, “You mean to tell me that you hid Connor’s body in his own home?”
The shadow that had fallen across Mr. O suddenly grew larger, and Miss Monday at last took notice. She whirled about to see another of the unliving creatures, which had crept up unnoticed, behind him.
“Mr. O!” she cried in alarm.
He spun around to see the creature leering at him. It growled hungrily, and Mr. O reached for his rifle—too slow.
The monster swung its right arm, stiffly. Mr. O moved to duck out of the way, but not quickly enough. He creature’s arm struck Mr. O hard against the head. He crumpled to the ground and lay motionless in the mud.
“Shit,” Miss Monday swore.
She stared in horror at the creature that stood beside him. Its arm, she realised, was not made of flesh and bone, but iron. No wonder Mr. O had dropped so hard to the ground.
“Mr. O,” she said again.
He lay motionless in the mud, as the creature moved towards him once again, opening its jaws with hunger in its dead eyes.
Miss Monday drew her pistol from her belt and fired, dropping the monster easily.
But there was no time for celebration. Just as she finished off the iron-armed monster, a chorus of cold and lifeless voices rose up from behind her.
The dead were converging upon the river, and Mr. O had lost consciousness.</Text>

            <Title>Scene Two</Title>
            <Text>The next time Annabel saw Anthony Tidkins was also the first time that Annabel had ever been caught stealing. It was nothing overly fancy. A necklace. But the theft had been overly brazen, even for her; she’d stolen it right off a lady’s neck.
She had nearly gotten away with it, too. The lady seemed not to have noticed the absence of her jewelry from her neck. She must not have felt Annabel’s little fingers unclasping the necklace while the lady shopped. It was the lady’s husband that caught her. A large, burly man who seized Annabel by the wrists and threatened to break her arms from her crime.
“Begging your pardon, sir,” Annabel heard someone saying, but there were tears stinging her eyes. The man was holding her arms so tight she really thought he might break them. “The girl is my charge. I assure you, she meant no offence. She is silly, you understand. My apologies, the girl gave me the slip. I do hope she hasn’t been bothering you too severely?”
Finally, Annabel turned to look at the man. She recognised him immediately, even with her eyes a-blur with tears. The albino handed a few coins to the brute, who relinquished his grip on Annabel’s arms, took the coins. He seized his wife’s necklace from Annabel’s trembling hand and returned it to his wife.
“Just see to it that this doesn’t happen again,” he said with a growl.
“Yes, sir,” was the albino’s reply. There was the hint of an American accent to his voice, though Annabel couldn’t place the dialect. Just that he sounded a bit different from other upper class gentlemen.
Annabel looked up at her mysterious benefactor, wondering if she ought to flee. If he had rescued her only to enact his own form of retribution. But curiosity kept her.
“Why?” she asked.
“You have a talent that I believe could be useful to me,” he told her.
She didn’t understand.
“I want to hire you,” he said.
“I’m not for sale,” she spat.
He smiled. “I mean to say that I wish to hire you as a thief,” he explained.
“Oh,” said Annabel, feeling silly. That wasn’t what she thought he’d meant. “What do you want me to steal?”
When he told her, Annabel smiled and gave a little curtsey. Anthony grinned.
“Jack,” he introduced himself, extending a hand. “Jack Bernhardt.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene Three</Title>
            <Text>Over the years, Anthony—known to her in those days as Jack—had introduced Annabel to several of his acquaintances, many of whom were, quite frankly, criminals. Her services were highly sought after by Anthony’s friends, and Annabel was all too happy to oblige and was quick to adapt her skill as a pickpocket to the theft of more valuable items, sought by the ton in part due to their illegal nature. Paintings, such as the one Annabel had provided for Mr. Sinews, for example; ancient Egyptian artifacts, which had required Annabel to break into museums; and more importantly, evidence, records, and files, which Annabel was able to rescue from the police without too much difficulty.
Then there was also the research that Annabel had stolen on Anthony’s behalf. This, according to Anthony, was the real reason he’d hired her. Her benefactor was a scientist, and though he was still in his teenage years, he was educated as a physician, had gone to university, and had studied under one of America’s most prominent doctors. Dr. Allen. Anthony’s pursuit of science was obsessive. He’d taken to pursuing shortcuts whenever possible.
He was not above stealing the research of other scientists. Annabel had personally visited the homes and laboratories of Charles Darwin, Edward Jenner, John Hunter, John Boyd Dunlop, Lord Kelvin, and Nikola Tesla, among others, and had returned to Anthony with unpublished studies, notes, and specimen, whatever he required for his endless pursuit of...
Annabel knew not what it was exactly that Anthony was studying.
But until now, she had always believed that while Anthony’s methods were criminal, his intentions were benevolent. He held life as the most precious gift. He’d often spoken to Annabel passionately about wanting to make a difference in the world. Every life, he’d always said, was worth saving. This, Annabel had always felt, was why he’d saved hers, all those years ago. He’d taken her in, given her a home and a purpose, helped her to elevate her social and financial position. And years later, he’d saved her yet again, when her eye had been ripped from its socket.
It was for this reason that she felt a mild stinging in the back of her eyes, as she realised that Anthony was utterly, completely insane. She’d been taken in by his lies. She hadn’t even needed to be drugged to be taken in.
“What do you want with me, Jack?” she hissed. It was the only way to keep herself from crying. She wouldn’t let herself be weak, not in front of him. So she set her mouth in a cruel sneer and glared at the young man who’d treated her as a daughter. “You tried to kill me.”
Anthony laughed. He sounded different. Perhaps that’s why she hadn’t recognised it before. Not just because it was muffled by the mask, but because there was a cruelty that had crept into his voice. There was no joy to his laughter.
“At the masquerade, you mean? You knew that was me?,” he asked.
Annabel kept her mouth shut, her eyes fixed dangerously on him.
“I wasn’t trying to kill you,” he said. “I was testing my hypothesis.”
While he spoke, Annabel was still looking for a way out. There had to be some way of getting past the dozens of Resurrectionists, even with their guns trained on her. She just had to wait for the right moment to present itself.
“What hypothesis?”
Before he had a chance to answer, a door swung open. She wanted to hear what Anthony had to say, but more than that, she wanted to get the hell out of here. She stepped through the door, pushing past the Resurrectionist that had opened it, before he could react. But instead of trying to stop her from getting away, he turned to the door, and bolted it shut.</Text>

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>The captain must have somehow managed to stop the ship from spiralling, but the danger had hardly passed. The ship’s gondola was still alight; the slightest spark that struck the Dreadful’s balloon or the slightest puncture in just one of the ballonets and they’d all be toast. They ought to abandon ship, but they were still hundreds of feet in the air, so it was really just a matter of choice: burn alive or plummet to the ground below.
There was little time to make the decision. The ship was descending at a rate far too rapid to be considered natural, and outside the window, the monstrous beast clung to the ship like an overgrown barnacle, dragging it to the earth below. It would not be long before they either exploded or crash landed.
“Here, put this on,” said Mr. O, shaking her as she climbed back onto her feet. Had she lost consciousness in the tumble? She couldn’t say. Mr. O appeared equally battered, blood dripping from numerous gashes on his face, bloodstains on his torn shirt sleeves. But wounded as he was, he seemed unshaken, and it was only fair, Miss Monday thought. It was almost surely his turn to rescue her.
So she played her part, as damsel in distress, and allowed him to help her to her feet. Then he began to buckle a set of straps around her shoulder. He buckled something heavy to her back, thrust something into her hand, and put a pair of goggles on her head. He guided her outside, shouting out instructions as they went.
It was loud, so the shouting was imperative to her understanding, and if she was going to jump from a falling airship, she needed to understand the instructions.
“Once you leap from the ship, pull that cord, and the engine should provide enough thrust for the wings to carry you.”
It took a moment for her brain to catch up with her. Wings, she wondered. A moment later, she remembered Icarus. She spared a glance over her shoulder to confirm it. The winged contraption Dr. Tidkins had designed all those years ago and which Mr. O had saved from the doctor-inventor’s time at the Agency.
“Never go anywhere unprepared,” said Mr. O.
“You’re learning,” she replied with a smirk. Her lips creased into a frown. “What about you?”
“Parachute,” he said, and with a running start he leapt from the ship.
“Parachute?” she repeated, wonderingly.
There was a sound of rending metal as the beast’s grip on the airship tightened, and she knew she was out of time. She wondered about the other passengers—Captain Merrick, Ashcroft, Lockwood—but there was no time to help them, even if she could. She simply wished them the best. Then she ran to the edge of the ship and without looking over it, jumped.
Her stomach lurched. It was bad enough flying in an airship; this was infinitely worse. The sky was a blur, just shapes and colours whipping past. The wind in her ears was a deafening rush of noise. Her ears popped as she gained speed. There might have been tears in her eyes from the wind, but the goggles did a nice enough job in preventing that. So it was with clear vision that she could see the trees below growing larger with every second that passed.
She did as Mr. O had instructed. She attempted to angle her body to let the wings catch hold of the wind and use it to glide out of the descent. As she did so, she gave a pull on the cord in her hand, and the engine on her back began to sputter. She pulled it again, and it rumbled noisily. The wind caught in her wings.
Stray feathers filled the air, but she managed to pull out of her free-fall, propelled by the jet pack on her back and by the sheer force of the wind. Suddenly she wasn’t falling. She was gliding. Flying, soaring above the forest.
She let out a whoop of joy. It was exhilarating, not just because she’d survived almost certain death. It was also the joy of defying gravity, of taking to the sky.
But this was no time for celebration. Quickly learning to manoeuvre Icarus, she circled back, scanning the skies for any sign of Mr. O. It would have helped if it wasn’t so damned dark. All she had was the moonlight and the rapidly plummeting flames of the smoking airship to light her way.
Boom.
The explosion was loud, and it was sudden. But it was not on the scale Miss Monday had expected. As she flew toward its source, she could see that the airship’s gondola had crashed into the forest below, taking the gargantuan beast with it. When it struck the earth, it had burst into flame.
The abominable—and seemingly indestructible—cockroach must finally have been killed. Its enormous husk lay motionless, burnt by the roaring flames and impaled by the ship’s broken frame.
But remarkably, The Penny Dreadful was not entirely destroyed. Somehow, the gondola had been detached from the blimp, which—no longer weighed down by the enormous weight of the ship and the heavy cockroach—had risen back into the sky.
The canvas that encased it was tattered. The lettering on its side was damaged, so that the ship’s name, The Penny Dreadful, was no longer legible. Only the last word was still clear.
Dreadful.
That summed things up nicely, Miss Monday thought. She saw a patch of canvas, caught in the forest’s canopy, which she thought might be Mr. O’s parachute. It was hard to see anything in this impenetrable darkness. She made her way towards him, clumsily navigating the wind like a fledgling crow thrust from its mother’s nest for its first flight.
She whirled toward him, shouting his name as she went. The closer she got, the more alarming it became when he failed to answer.
“Mr. O,” she cried again.
Finally, she heard his voice from beneath the tarp, weakened by whatever new injuries he must have sustained.
She hadn’t the slightest idea of how to go about landing. She was flying too fast to simply drop down to the trees below, where Mr. O’s parachute appeared to be caught, but she couldn’t just turn off the engine on her back either. So she set out for a clearing, attempting to angle her wings in order to slow her flight as much as possible.
She decided upon what she considered her best spot for a landing pad, braced for what she expected would be a rather painful landing, and aimed for the ground.
She came in too fast, and at the last second, realising her miscalculation—or more accurately, panicking—she leaned back, angling the wings upward to avoid the ground. She swooped up again, taking care not to gain too much height. Her legs were dangling just above the ground, so she decided to give it another go. She angled toward the ground again, and felt her feet touch down. She was sprinting, mostly by instinct, trying to keep up with her momentum, like when running down a surprisingly steep hill.
The clearing wasn’t large enough to keep up this pace for long, and her legs were burning. Finally, she thought to pull the cord again, and stopped the motor. The change in speed was abrupt, as the engine sputtered to a stop, and suddenly her legs were over her head, and she was lying facedown on the grass.
“Ow,” she groaned.
Well, at least she was alive. She struggled to her feet, winded and bruised by her fall. Her wings were badly broken, she noticed. She pouted, not sure whether to discard the wings or attempt to salvage them. Eventually, she unstrapped them from her back and left them where they were. She kept the rocket pack though, as she had it in her head that it must be expensive.
Though Mr. O was likely waiting—stranded in a tree—for her rescue, she was forced to go slowly as she trudged her way through the woods towards him, favouring the leg that was least injured. She called his name as she went. Flight had disoriented her, and she wasn’t entirely sure where to find him. It was also incredibly dark and despite her oft-repeated motto of never going anywhere unprepared, she was without match or lantern. More than once she felt tree branches snapping painfully in her face as she pushed through the brambles.
Eventually, she heard his voice, quiet but unmistakable. He’d gotten himself quite tangled, as she’d somewhat expected, and was hanging from the highest branch of a tall tree. Unable to extricate himself from the knotted ropes of his parachute. Groaning in pain. Even more badly injured than when he’d leapt from the airship and nearly got himself blown up.
Idiot.
“I could use some help,” he groaned.
“I can see that,” said Miss Monday, setting her jetpack upon the ground. It was a relief to have it off her back. Damned thing was heavy. “I’m not sure what you’d like me to do though,” she called up to him. “You’re not expecting me to scale that tree, are you?”
“I don’t know,” he called back. “I didn’t exactly think this through. I’m lucky to be alive.”
He was working at the ropes while he talked, doing his best to untangle himself from the knotted web of ropes, which had wrapped around the branches of the tree. He had to be careful not to untie the wrong rope, or he’d end up falling to the ground. He wasn’t high enough that the fall was likely to kill him, but he was high enough that it might.
“What of the ship?” he asked.
“Destroyed,” she replied. “Except the balloon, which must have been detached somehow. Might be able to salvage it, if you can find it that is. Without the ship to weigh it down and without a pilot, it’s just drifting.”
“And the crew?” he asked.
“I don’t know,” she said, sadly. “But it seems unlikely that anyone else survived.”
“Shit,” said Mr. O. His sincerity was overwhelming. To be fair, he’d only just found out that he had a ship and crew, so he’d hardly had time to develop an attachment to any of them. But still, it was a bit heartless, wasn’t it? Miss Monday at least had liked Ashcroft and Lockwood. And Captain Merrick, of course. And how many men had been aboard the ship? Were they dead, all of them?
“What about Palmer?” said Mr. O, real concern in his voice now.
Miss Monday hesitated. Mr. Palmer was one of Mr. O’s agents. One of his last few agents that hadn’t been killed in the line of duty or by the Society of Immortals. Miss Monday knew that he considered Palmer a close friend. “Your guess is as good as mine,” she admitted. “Better, maybe. Did you have any more parachutes on board?”
“Pardon?” he shouted down.
It was difficult to talk while he was still stranded in the tree, and Miss Monday was growing impatient. She rolled up her sleeves and pulled her gloves on a bit tighter. She approached the tree, put a tentative hand on it. She tested her weight on the first branch. She looked up at Mr. O, gauging his distance from the ground. Then she began to climb. It wasn’t the most ladylike thing she’d ever done, but she wasn’t here to be ladylike, and she was in no mood to be delicate.
She climbed at a steady albeit not a quick pace, until she reached him. She positioned herself securely against a sturdy branch and the bough of the tree, and began the tedious process of untangling him. Whether he was surprised she’d made the climb or not, he didn’t say. But he did smile at her when she finally reached him, and he thanked her, when they finally managed to get him untangled and finished the climb down.
His injuries looked worse than she’d guessed they would be, now that she finally had a chance to look him over. Scrapes and bruises covered his body, and with every move he made he winced or gritted his teeth. When he coughed, he had to cover his mouth with a handkerchief to catch the blood, and she suspected he must have had more than one broken bone.
Only as she looked him over did she finally realise the sacrifice he’d made in giving Icarus to her and taking the parachute for himself. If it had been the other way around, he might have landed unscathed, while she might be the one with broken bones and internal bleeding.
“You aren’t going to die on me, are you?” she asked, when he began coughing up blood again. She managed to keep the emotion from her voice, phrasing the question as to be derisive rather than compassionate.
“No,” he said with a pained laugh. “I’ll live. But I would kill for a glass of whiskey right about now.”
She shook her head. “You’ve had quite enough of that for one day,” she scolded. “You might have had a smoother landing if you’d been sober,” she added.
He shrugged, wincing as he did. “Maybe,” he admitted.</Text>

            <Title>Scene 42</Title>
            <Text>“Well?” said the surgeon, when Anthony knocked upon the door.
“Are you Dr. Allen?” he asked nervously. “My father sent me.”
The surgeon nodded. He stood aside and beckoned for the boy to enter.
The lock on the door of his father’s cabinet had not stopped Anthony from attempting to learn his father’s trade. Anthony had merely been forced to call upon the expertise of one of the boys in his entourage, a boy who earned money by selling bodies to anatomy schools.
If Anthony couldn’t learn anatomy from books, he figured he could learn first-hand. He had performed several dissections before Mrs. Cartwright finally caught him. And had she ever screamed.
At last, Anthony’s father was forced to take action.
“Come in,” said the surgeon. He had a Scottish accent. “How was the journey here? Long, I imagine. Did you travel by train?”
“No, sir, by airship,” said Anthony.
Dr. Allen owned an anatomy school, one of the more successful schools in London. He lived in a small loft above the school.
The surgeon led him to a dining room, pulled out a chair and gestured for Anthony to sit. As he sat, Anthony took in the room. The first thing that he noticed was that the surgeon’s books were not behind lock and key. They were not even neatly organized on a single shelf, but spread about the room, some of them open and marked up by the surgeon’s own pen. Most of the books were the same as the ones his father owned, but there were some that were unfamiliar.
He also had a number of preparations in glass jars—lizards with two tails, dissected internal organs, jellyfish, baby crocodiles, a monkey’s skull. A rooster with a human tooth in its mouth.
The surgeon disappeared through the hallway for only a moment, and when he returned he was accompanied by a servant, who laid out a plate of food or the boy. Anthony dug in, but amidst eating, he began to pester the surgeon with questions.
“What book is that?” he asked.
“Gray’s Anatomy,” said the surgeon.
“Oh,” said Anthony, a bit disappointed. “I’ve read that. Yours looks different from the copy my father owns.”
“This is the American edition,” the surgeon explained. “So you’ve read Henry Gray?”
“I’ve practically memorized it,” said Anthony, more enthusiastic than boastful. “It’s fascinating, isn’t it?” Almost immediately, he became distracted. “What’s that one?” he asked around a mouthful of bread.
“The Institutes and Practice of Surgery. Have you read it?”
Anthony nodded.
“You like to read, don’t you?” said the surgeon.
Anthony nodded again.
“We have that in common,” said the surgeon. “But I prefer reading bodies to reading books.”
“Reading bodies?” young Anthony Tidkins asked.
The surgeon nodded. “You can learn a lot about a man from his body. I understand you’ve conducted a few dissections of your own?”
Anthony nodded, a guilty look on his face.
“Good,” said the surgeon, getting up. Anthony looked surprised. “Come, leave your supper. It can wait.”
He headed off down the hall, leaving Anthony to hurry after him. He heard the surgeon’s footsteps heading down a creaking flight of stairs, and realized he was heading down to the anatomy school. He followed.
Dr. Allen turned the lights on downstairs, and fit his key into the lock. He headed into school, the young boy trailing behind him. They went into the operating room, a sterile-looking room with a number of tools laid out neatly on the desk. There were raised seats around the operating table, where the students could sit and watch dissections. On the table was the body of a man in his thirties, naked, his skin pale and cold. Anthony swallowed, and looked up at the surgeon, suddenly uncertain. The doctor gestured at his surgical kit, his tools laid out.
“If you’re going to be my apprentice,” he said, “Let’s see how you are at dissection.”</Text>
            <Notes> Anthony had been sent here. He was to be apprenticed to a surgeon - one who was more patient than Anthony’s father, and who ran a medical school - in London. Anthony was eleven years old at the time.

            <Title>Scene Two</Title>
            <Text>Miss Monday stood staring at the smouldering remains of the cockroach. Disgusting, she thought. It smelled odd, like burned meat, but it was mostly the sheer size of the creature’s hulking remains that astonished and disturbed her. It was one thing to see it from within the ship. To stand next to it was another thing entirely. It was the size of an enormous whale, big enough to swallow a man whole, and covered in the thick natural armor of chitin.
“How could this thing have survived so much?” she asked. “I was certain we had blown it to smithereens, when you shoved a hydrogen balloon up its throat.”
He shrugged in that superior way of his that always got under her skin. “We did kill it. There were two of them,” he said.
“How do you know?” she asked. Even with the still glowing embers of the fire, it was still too dark to get a good look at the Beast.
“No weaponry on this one. Also, I must admit I was wrong about what I said earlier. They were trying to get us out of the way, as I suspected, but they meant to do so in a much more permanent way than I initially believed. Two of these damned things? Evidently not a test devised by the monarchy.”
Definitely not, Miss Monday agreed. Just one of these things was enough to wreck their ship. But two of them? It was miraculous that there were any survivors to speak of. “So, they want us dead. That’s not exactly news, is it?”
“No,” Mr. O agreed, “But we have learned something important from all of this, haven’t we?” He stooped over and, flinching at first because the exoskeleton was still hot and because some of his ribs were broken, began to pry the roach’s chitinous shell from its body. “Help me with this, would you? I want to bring a sample back to the laboratory for Dr. Simms.”
“Well, yes, we certainly know what they’re capable of, now, don’t we?” she said, reaching over to help with the shell, which pried apart with a sound like gauze being stripped off an infected wound.
“Yes, precisely. When they set the mechanically enhanced dead upon us, they showed their hand. This revealed the involvement of Dr. Tidkins; his knowledge of the Lazarus Virus combined with his aptitude as both engineer and surgeon made that abundantly clear. The use of Beasts, mutated beyond what is commonly expected from a Lazarus mutation, reveals that Tidkins' knowledge has expanded since leaving the Agency—meaning that he has had access either to a a laboratory in which to conduct research or to collaborators with whom he could compare notes. They have also revealed the weapons with which they intend to fight. Giant Beasts armed with machine guns. Certainly threatening, but less so, now that we know what we’re up against. And the forged letter reveals the depth of their network; it seems that they have spies even within the monarchy. Each attempt on our lives reveals another clue. And who knows what else we will discover from this creature’s remains? Let them try to kill us again!”
Miss Monday shook her head. She wasn’t quite sure what to do with the hot chunk of carapace in her hand, so she held it awkwardly at her side. “Sir, you’re still drunk.”
“No,” he said. “Falling from an airship—twice in one night—was quite sobering. I’m not drunk; I’m simply worked up. They’ve killed my friends. They’ve killed my crew. They’ve destroyed my airship. They’ve tried to kill me. And they nearly killed you as well. It’s time we send them a message.”
“What message?”
“That we are not to be trifled with!” he said, more loudly than he intended. As an addendum, he added quietly, “Hm, perhaps I am still a bit drunk.”
Miss Monday sighed. Oh, really, she thought sarcastically, though she kept the thought to herself. “By the way,” she said, “How are we going to get back to London?”
Mr. O looked around and seemed to be seeing for the first time that they were deep within a forest miles away from London, in pitch-black night. “Shit,” he muttered to himself. “Now, that is a very good question.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene Two</Title>
            <Synopsis>Mrs. Grimmer reveals her true colours, and shoots her son with a tranquilizer dart, again.</Synopsis>
            <Text>After Mrs. Grimmer had revealed her plan, and the Vigilance Committee had agreed to it, the crew began to file out the door. As Jonathan turned to leave, he was forestalled by a hand on his shoulder.
“A brief word?” said Abraham Palmer.
“Of course,” said Jonathan, wondering what this might be about.
“I’d like to ask you something, and I’d like to be direct, if I may,” said Mr. Palmer, taking a seat at one of the tables and directing Jonathan to do the same. When Jonathan was settled, Palmer continued, “Do you trust your mother?”
Jonathan’s eyes rose. Well, he couldn’t fault the man for being indirect.
“I overheard her speaking with someone; I now believe it was you, Mr. Palmer.”
“What did you hear?”
“Something about Miss Monday,” he said. “What about the woman? The thief? I believe you must have been discussing the idea that we had both been exposed to Lazarus and survived. The Resurrectionists wanted to test the theory that we might possess some immunity to it. You wanted to give us up to them.”
If Mr. Palmer was surprised to have been overheard, he didn’t let on.
“I did, yes. But your mother was reluctant to give you up, even though it might have saved London from being wiped off the map. She wanted to use Annabel instead.” He continued. “The first batch of the antiserum was derived from corvine birds, which possess a natural resistance to the virus. Not all animals do, you see. So crows became a subject of interest to the Resurrectionists involved in the Lazarus project. We believed, given their natural immunity, that they might allow the Resurrectionists to synthesize an antiserum.”
“Through his research, Dr. Allen became unintentionally exposed to the virus. Lazarus works in two stages. In stage one, the virus slowly kills the host body. It is only in stage two that the body becomes a zombie. As Dr. Allen was in stage one, he became useful as a test subject for the antiserum. If we could cure that stage of the virus, we could harness immortality; the virus would act only to keep the body alive after death, but without the other negative side effects: necrosis, rot, the primal urge to eat living flesh.
“The infected would not be zombies, but undead. The antiserum actually showed promise. It worked to a point, preventing the virus from killing him, but it was still not a cure. Dr. Allen was dying; we were only delaying the inevitable. He believed that crows would not suffice to provide a cure. The cure had to come from humans. Humans who’d been exposed to Lazarus and survived.”
“Me and Miss Monday, you mean,” said Jonathan.
“As Mrs. Grimmer wished, I tried to persuade them to use only the thief, to stay away from you. When you wandered straight into their facilities, that became problematic. Your mother managed to get you out, and she left me to ensure Miss Monday’s rescue.”
“I thought you were going to give her up to them?”
“It was too late for that,” said Palmer. “Dead London was already in motion.”
“What do you mean?” said Jonathan.
“There was no guarantee that Miss Monday’s blood would hold the cure. With so much at stake, even with her blood in hand, the Resurrectionists couldn’t afford to take chances. The plan was to go ahead, no matter what. When she managed to escape her cell, it became clear that she was more of a threat to their cause than she was useful as a test subject. That’s why I helped her escape.”
Jonathan’s mind was whirling. So many things just didn’t add up. Even working from within, how could Palmer know so much? He pushed his chair back a little, watching the man cautiously. He twitched uneasily when Jonathan moved his chair.
“You rescued her just to get her out of the way,” said Jonathan.
“Yes,” he admitted. “I’m playing both sides, you see. I needed you, and Miss Monday, and Mrs. Grimmer to continue to trust me, just long enough for the Dead London Project to begin before you would have a chance to stop it.”
Jonathan’s eyes widened.
“You were drugged after all.”
“No, Mr. Grimmer. Simply loyal to the Resurrectionist cause.”
“Our plan will work. We’ll stop you,” Jonathan sneered.
“No,” Palmer replied, cold and certain.
With that, the man drew a tranquilizer gun from his jacket, and fired it into Jonathan’s neck. The dart’s effects were quick. Jonathan felt suddenly drowsy. His knees collapsed. He hit the ground hard, for the second time that day.
He heard the chiming of bells. They sounded distant. Abraham Palmer’s voice, muffled and indistinct.
“Jonathan will catch up with us,” he said. “We are to begin without him.”
“Asshole,” Jonathan groaned as his eyelids grew as heavy as lead weights.</Text>
            <Notes>Removed:
Although she was being serious, her tone was light, as if she was half-joking. It didn’t suit her, Jonathan thought. He frowned. “We might have had more time, if you’d thought to be honest with me from the beginning,” he said. “Or, for that matter, if you hadn’t shot me and Miss Monday with tranquilizers.”
“You’re upset with me,” she said, adopting his serious tone. “I can’t say I blame you. I did keep the truth from you, you’re right. But I did so to protect you.”
“Is that what you call it, protecting me?” Jonathan said, exasperated. “Well, a fat lot of good it’s done, this protection of yours.”
“You’re alive, aren’t you?” she said, quite seriously.
“Yes, but no thanks to you,” he replied.
She looked wounded.
He took a deep breath, forced himself to be calm. His relationship with his mother had always been like this. But he could see, from her perspective, how she might have thought she’d been protecting him by keeping the truth from him. Still, he wouldn’t put it past her to be aligned with the Resurrectionists and even now to be manipulating him. Just because she was his mother didn’t mean he could trust her. He decided to be direct.</Notes>

            <Title>Scene Two</Title>
            <Text>The dead girl was petite, which was lucky, because Mr. O insisted on taking her with them. He slung her over his broad, muscular shoulders, and seemed not to notice the additional weight. He hurried along the muddy banks of the river, his pace only slowed by the thick, slippery mud that lined the riverbank, and by his occasional need to take aim and dispatch an unliving creature that blocked his way.
Miss Monday did her best to keep up, but even with the girl slung over his shoulder, she found it difficult to match the pace he had set, gaining ground only when he paused to shoot.
Uncommonly deadly unliving men and women were armed varyingly, with guns, sharp blades, and armour attached to them like prosthetics. How they managed to operate the guns, Mr. O could only speculate, but he supposed that they were not actually controlling the weapons. The guns were made to fire by clockwork machines, and they were aimed by the unliving creatures’ hunger, which caused them to stare straight at Mr. O and Miss Monday.
They stopped to kill only the ones that blocked their path, and the ones who carried firearms. The rest, they ignored, running past them, running from the riverbank to the city streets. There were too many to kill them all, and they were running low on ammunition. Already, Miss Monday had used up her supply of grenades.
“Not bad,” said Miss Monday, as Mr. O paused to shoot an unliving man, who fell to the ground with a thud. “For a man,” she added.
They drudged their way up the slopes of the river, away from the Thames and into the city. Eventually, they realised that they were no longer being followed by the mindless hordes of the unliving.
They halted, out of breath, on a quiet street somewhere near the bridge.
They took the time to stuff the girl into a duffel bag, lest some passerby happen upon them.
Then, at last, Mr. O was free to wipe the sludge from his boots. It fell away in dried and damp clumps upon the street as he scraped his feet. Miss Monday followed suit, and when she’d removed the bulk of the weight from her boots, she cleaned them as best she could with Mr. O’s handkerchief.
“Are you bitten?” asked Mr. O, looking at her with concern.
“I’m fine,” she replied, still out of breath and somewhat shaken by their brush with death.
“Let me see your arm,” he persisted.
“I said I’m fine.”
“I must insist,” said Mr. O, “I don’t wish to alarm you, but a bite from one of these creatures can be fatal. If your skin is punctured…”
She looked up from her task of cleaning her boots, and fixed him with a deadly stare. “I’m. Fine.”
Not being one to back down, he ignored the warning in her voice. “First rule. Do not let them bite you,” he said, reminding her of their earlier conversation. “Now quit being stubborn and let me examine your arm.”
“You ought to consider a new first rule. Do not lose consciousness, perhaps?”
“Yes, yes, very amusing,” said Mr. O, “Now roll back your sleeve and let me see the damage. You know we may have to amputate.”
Finally, Miss Monday relented. She began by peeling off her glove. “Little late for that,” she said.
“It may very well be,” Mr. O retorted.
Then she drew back her sleeve, and he fell silent.
Mr. O stared at her quietly, as he suddenly understood her reluctance to allow him to examine her arm. As she’d said, there was no cause for concern about the bite. Though he’d regained consciousness just in time to see the creature bite down hard upon her arm, his concern had been for nothing.
Her arm was a prosthetic. Like the clockwork eye she strapped to her face each morning, her arm was made of mechanical parts. Gears which clicked as she rotated her forearm, hydraulics which hissed as she flexed her artificial muscles. Gears clicked with the steady rhythm of a clock each time she rotated her wrist. Each joint bore a keyhole. The key she wore like a pendant around her neck looked to be a perfect fit. She must have wound up her arm like a music box.
The arm was copper and brass and made with the extraordinary workmanship of her mechanical eye. It moved with quiet motions, even as the gears whirred and clicked. She demonstrated the dexterity in her hand by flexing each of her fingers in turn, clenching her hand into a fist.
“See,” she said, “No bite marks.”
In awe, Mr. O reached out a hand to touch her arm.
“You’ve already been slapped by a metal arm once today. Are you really so eager to repeat the experience?”
He retracted his hand.
“Sorry,” he said. “It’s just…”
“What?” she said, covering up her arm again with her sleeve. “Freakish? Inhuman?”
“Fascinating,” he murmured. He was looking at her in a way that she found unsettling. Unsettling in that it was sincere, honest, and—dare she think it—affectionate.
She blushed. No one had ever looked at her in this way, not after they’d seen her arm. Most men blanched at the sight of her eye, and the scar that ran down the length of her face. She was pretty, sure, but she was also disfigured. If the eye wasn’t enough to turn people away, her arm most certainly was.
But Mr. O reached out, gently, and touched her cheek. She flushed, hot, and felt her heart flutter in her chest.
“You’re not a freak,” said Mr. O. “You’re extraordinary.”
He put his hand against the back of her neck, leaned in close, and let his lips linger half an inch from hers.
Almost against her will, she reached out in return, and pressed her brass hand against the back of his neck, pressed her body close to his, and pressed her lips against his. She felt too vulnerable, too exposed, with her arm uncovered like this. But there was also a joy in it; she felt like a bird being freed from its cage. All she had to do was take flight.
Her breath caught in her throat, and she felt a warmth in her very bones, as he returned her kiss. Her heart pounded, and she felt her cheeks flush, red-hot. It started as a gentle kiss, his lips tenderly caressing hers, but it quickly gave way to passion and fire, and he kissed her roughly, grasping her by the back of the head tightly.
Maddeningly, he suddenly pulled away from her, but then he leaned back in and began to plant kisses upon her neck, small wet pecks that moved their way up her neck and caused her to grasp the hair on the back of his neck and press herself as close to him as she could. She pressed her left hand against his hip, and she moaned softly as his teeth tugged at the lobe of her ear.
He put his hand upon her arm. She couldn’t feel his hand there, not exactly, but she felt a slight pressure in her shoulder, where the prosthesis was affixed to her flesh. Suddenly, she drew away from him.
“I’m sorry,” she said. “I can’t…”
“It’s fine,” Mr. O tried to say, but Miss Monday was hardly listening.
“No, really, I’m sorry,” she said, flustered by her own impulsiveness, and still feeling naked with her glove stripped off. “How improper,” she said, “I honestly don’t know what came over me. Really, I don’t even like you.”
“Oh, that’s reassuring,” he said angrily, though he was blushing from cheek to ear. “Anyway, it was my fault entirely. Forget it ever happened.”
“I will then,” she snapped.
Just then, they heard the familiar clipping off a horse’s hooves upon the cobble street, and the roll of wheels upon stone, sparing them of the awkwardness that came after a passionate but inappropriate kiss.
Miss Monday quickly slipped her glove back on her mechanical hand.
“Sir?” said the driver.</Text>

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Synopsis>Abraham Palmer helps Annabel to escape, though she mistrusts him.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Annabel raced down the hallway, the Resurrectionist in tow. The others were still banging on the door, demanding that he open it, but he was single-minded in his pursuit of her. It was difficult to run, her skirts trailing heavily behind her, and difficult to breathe, her corset tightly laced. The Resurrectionist was gaining ground.
Still she ran, her boots thudding hard against the concrete floor of the hall. In the dim lighting, she could see the brass cage of another elevator, not too far ahead. She raced toward it, breathing heavily. She slammed into the gate, unable to slow her momentum, but with barely a pause she threw the door open. She stepped inside and reached to shut the gates.
Too late. The Resurrectionist’s hand barred the gate. Annabel let out a surprised cry. She’d thought she’d been quick enough. The bastard was strong. She tried to shut the gate, fighting against him as he strained to keep it open. She changed tactics.
She began to swat at his hand, trying to force him to release his grip. He yelped, but his grip was firm. She grasped his fingers with her own and began to peel them off, one by one.
“Stop!” he protested. “Stop it. I’m trying to help you.”
She recognised his voice. He had an American accent.
“Like hell,” she said.
She knew this bastard was in collusion with Mrs. Grimmer. She’d heard him talking with her.  She told him what she’d heard.
“I can explain,” he said.
She imagined he could. Not that she was likely to believe his explanation, but she was sure he’d have one. But in the distance she heard the door beginning to splinter beneath the efforts of his fellow Resurrectionists, and she knew that she had little choice but to humour him. She was unarmed and he had the advantage if it came to fighting. He was strong and was dressed in a gentleman’s attire, much better suited to a physical confrontation.
She stepped back and allowed him to slide the gate open.
“Off with the mask,” she told him as he stepped into the elevator.
As she took hold of the lever and started up the ascent, he did as bidden. His hair was damp with sweat, a side effect of wearing a leather mask, but he had a handsome face. A scruffy layer of dark facial hair, brown eyes and a slight scar that ran down his cheek gave him a tough, masculine appearance.
Well, at least he was easy on the eyes, Annabel thought, even if she couldn’t trust him.
“Abraham Palmer,” he said. His American drawl was subtle enough to suggest that he’d been in England for quite some time.
“Miss Monday,” she replied, though he obviously knew who she was. She glance upward, but it was impossible to see anything in the darkness of the elevator shaft, and even so her view was blocked by the roof of the cage. “Where will we emerge?” she asked.
The machine rattled noisily upward, but even despite the din of the elevator, they could hear the Resurrectionists breaking into the hallway below. They weren’t safe yet. Annabel doubted the floor was thick enough to protect them if the Resurrectionists decided to start shooting at them. And they could always just cut through the cord, and the entire cage would come tumbling down. She silently urged it to climb faster.
“My office,” he said. He ran a hand through his damp hair. “Don’t worry. They want you alive.”
Annabel wasn’t convinced. She looked dubiously at the floor of the cage and listened for the sound of cutting rope. She could hear distant, muffled voices echoing up the shaft. Nothing else, but the ordinary clicking of gears and winding of pulleys.
“Why?” she said, finally.
“At Lord Connor’s, you were exposed to the Lazarus Virus, were you not?” Mr. Palmer replied.
“The vial?”
He nodded.
“I think so,” Annabel told him. “It smelt of death.”
“And then later, you were hit with a dart that was laced with the virus.”
Annabel nodded again. She didn’t know what he was getting at. Yes, she had the Lazarus Virus. She didn’t know exactly how it worked, or what would happen to her, but she knew that she would soon become one of those hideous living dead creatures, like the unbreathing one in the laboratory. Like Lord Connor, or the man who’d fallen from the second story of his mansion.
“You still display no symptoms whatsoever, of the virus.”
She looked at him, suddenly. She remembered the conversation she’d overheard, when sneaking about Lord Connor’s garden.
“I was given to understand that the—what's the phrase?—incubation time…?"
Palmer nodded.
"I understand the incubation time varies.”
“True,” Mr. Palmer agreed. “Sometimes it takes minutes, rather than seconds, for the change to occur. An hour or two, at most.”
“What? But I’ve had it much longer than that.”
“The Resurrectionists believe you may possess immunity to the virus,” he said.
Annabel frowned. She’d heard them say something to that effect, but she hadn’t had much time to put much thought into what they’d meant.
“So, you can rest assured they want you alive,” he told her, “If only to confirm your immunity.”
The sound of a bullet interrupted his thoughts and proved him a liar. The bullet ricocheted inside the elevator shaft and struck the floor of the cage. It put a dent in the floor, but didn’t penetrate the floor.
“You were saying…?” Annabel said.
“Shit,” Abraham swore.
More bullets joined the first, until the elevator shaft was filled with the banging of gunfire and smell of powder. Like the first, the subsequent bullets at first failed to break through the metal floor of the cage. But as the Resurrectionists continued to fire, Annabel felt a bullet whiz past her face. It struck the ceiling above. She looked at Abraham as if she expected him to do something about it. As if he could.
“Why keep me alive when my blood is enough to test their hypothesis?” she said. “Are you armed?”
Another bullet broke through. It wasn’t as close as the first, but it was no less unsettling. She looked to Abraham and held out her hand. He surrendered his firearm.
She aimed the muzzle through the hole in the floor and fired. She heard a cry of alarm from below. Hopefully her bullet had struck home. She fired again, and was answered with another alarmed shout. But the Resurrectionists didn’t cease fire. Annabel fired again and again, almost emptying the chamber. She wanted to save at least one bullet, just in case.
At last, the elevator shuddered to a halt, and Mr. Palmer slid the door open. They practically tumbled out of the elevator. Annabel looked herself over and was relieved to see that while her skirt was ridden with bullet holes, she herself was unscathed. She looked to Abraham, who was clutching his shoulder. There was blood on his hands.</Text>

            <Title>The Etiquette of Travelling</Title>
            <Text>The reader will call to mind people who always appear at ease when they are traveling. Investigation will prove that these individuals have usually had a wide experience in journeying, and an extensive acquaintance with the world. The experienced traveler has learned the necessity of always being on time, of having baggage checked early, of purchasing a ticket before entering the cars, and of procuring a seat in a good location before the car is full.
The inexperienced traveler is readily known by his flurry and mistakes. He is likely to be behind time, and he is likely to be an hour too early. For want of explicit direction, his baggage often fails to reach the train in time, or does not come at all. His trunks, from lack of strength, are liable to be easily broken. In his general confusion, when he buys a ticket he neglects to place it where it will be secure, and consequently loses it. He forgets a portion of his baggage, and thus in a dozen ways he is likely to be in trouble.
People with weak eyes should avoid reading on the train, and those having weak lungs should avoid much talking, as an undue effort will be required to talk above the noise of the train.
Passengers should avoid eating at irregular times on the journey, and gentlemen should avoid smoking in the presence of those to whom it may be offensive.
Avoid wearing laces, velvets, or any articles that naturally accumulate and hold dust. Excessive finery or a lavish display of jewelry are in bad taste on extended journeys.
A lady and gentleman should avoid evidences of undue familiarity in the presence of strangers. Couples who may evince a silly affection by over-fondling each other in public make themselves appear extremely ridiculous to all who may see them.
Ladies and gentlemen who are strangers, being thrown into the company of each other for a long journey, need not necessarily refuse to speak to each other. While the lady should be guarded, acquaintance may be made with certain reserve.
If the gentleman is an authorized escort, he should purchase the needed confections and literature on the train. He should be fruitful in the introduction of topics that will enliven, amuse, and instruct the lady, if she is inclined to be reticent.

Etiquette for the Unattended Lady At The Hotel

The unattended lady should enter a hotel by the ladies’ entrance. When in the parlour, she should send for the proprietor or clerk, present her card, and state the length of time that she designs to remain.
By request, the waiter will meet the lady at the entrance to the dining room and conduct her to a seat, thus saving her the necessity of crossing the room without an escort.</Text>

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Synopsis>Jonathan is about to fly off in his airship, when Abraham Palmer and Annabel Grey arrive at his house and agree to join him.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Much as Jonathan disliked air travel, he was glad to be back aboard the Penny Dreadful. After hours spent deep, deep underground, the idea of being out in the open air was more exhilarating than unnerving. Not that he’d really be in the open air; to look around the passenger’s lounge, one might never know that one was in a dirigible, so long as one did not look out the windows. Of course, if Jonathan really wanted the open air experience, he had only to climb a short set of stairs and step out the hatch, and he’d arrive at the prow of the ship, where Captain Merrick stood at the ready.
The Dreadful was not yet in motion. The crew was busy putting the final touches on the renovations and readying the ship for flight. Jonathan had been assured that it would be a matter of minutes.
In the meantime, by invitation, two of the crew members had joined him in the passenger’s lounge. Manfred had arranged for tea and victuals, which went a long way to earning him a modicum of trust in Jonathan’s eyes. He nibbled on a scone and took a sip of tea. It had been a long day and he was still feeling the ill effects of the poisoned dart; the tea was especially comforting, therefore.
He turned to one of the crewmen.
“Mr. Lockwood,” he said. “Your report, if you please.”
The young man took a bite of his scone and chewed enthusiastically. “’Fraid I’ve got nuffin’ ter report, guv’nor,” he said, talking with his mouth half full. “Mr. Sinews weren’t at Newgate, and ‘e weren’t at none of the other prisons I went ter, neither. Went ter Scotland Yard too, sir. Ye won’t believe this…”
“Try me,” Jonathan replied.
“Well, guv,” he said, leaning forward conspiratorially, “Seems the gavvers ain’t ‘eard nuffin’ ‘bout Dr. Allen’s ‘rrest, nor Mr. Sinews’ neither. Far as they know, both men ‘re still at large.”
Jonathan sat back in his chair and sipped his tea thoughtfully. “Well done, Mr. Lockwood,” he said, though he didn’t quite know what to make of all this.
But it did make it abundantly clear that the Resurrectionists’ resources were vast. Either they had planted themselves within Scotland Yard, or they had the power to imitate policemen, even to summon a caravan of Black Marias in order to sell the illusion. In any case, he hadn’t the foggiest clue where they’d taken Mr. Sinews.
The man to Lockwood’s left was Professor Ashcroft, who was one of the ship’s engineers and, like Mr. Lockwood, a former sailor as well, if Jonathan was not mistaken in his recollection of the introductions.
“How soon till we take off?” Jonathan asked.
Before the man could answer, Manfred cleared his throat.
“You have visitors, sir.”
“Who?” he asked.
Manfred told him. Jonathan nodded.
“Very well. Send them aboard.”
He turned to the crewmen, thanked them for their time, and politely dismissed them.</Text>

            <Title>Scene Three</Title>
            <Text>“Good afternoon,” said Mr. O, still blushing.
The cab driver tipped his hat and told Mr. O to hop in.
Mr. O forced a smile and climbed in.
The perfect cab driver, as far Mr. O was concerned, was one that did not look a gift horse in the mouth. Whatever was in Mr. O’s duffel bag, the cab driver did not need to know. Nor should he object about the muddied state of their clothes, or the fact that Miss Monday was wearing men’s trousers, or that Mr. O probably had lipstick smeared across his face. What should he care? The Agency always paid well, didn’t they?
Still, Mr. O couldn’t help but feeling embarrassed at his breach of conduct. Apparently, Miss Monday felt similarly about the situation; she too was still blushing, bright red. She climbed into the cab and looked quite deliberately away from him.
“Where to, Mr. Grimmer?”
“To the Agency,” he said.
The light swish and crack of the driver’s whip was answered by the sound of the horse’s hooves upon the rain-slick cobblestone streets.
For a while, they sat in silence, apparently unable to face each other.
“Miss Monday,” said Mr. O, still avoiding eye contact. “I’ve been meaning to ask, but I feared it would be impolite to inquire, but I feel as though the information may be quite pertinent to the situation. Might I ask…”
She cut him off. “Yes,” she said, “You may ask, but I’d rather not give my answer until we arrive back at the Agency, if that suits you.”
Mr. O nodded. “Fair enough,” he said, “I suppose that may be wise.”
The driver led them at a quick pace through the familiar streets of London. Rain still continued to drizzle and leave streaks upon the cab’s windows. Miss Monday’s breath created fog upon the window as she looked at at the damp grey world outside the cab.
“Who do you think she was?” Miss Monday asked, gesturing subtly at the duffel bag.
“I’m not sure,” said Mr. O, “A Whitechapel girl, I suppose. Does it make you sad?”
“It makes me introspective,” said Miss Monday.
She turned to the window again and blew hot air upon the glass. Condensation blurred the windows, which rattled to the rhythm of the cab. She reached out with gloved finger and painted a name in the condensation. Anne. Mr. O leaned over as if to see what she’d written, but she quickly wiped the name away.
“What does the O really stand for?” she wondered aloud.
“It’s a nickname,” said Mr. O. “A reference to the name by which I was called when I was a boy: O, as in Oldest. My mother, having been self-diagnosed with a medical condition that prevented her from learning anyone’s name, even that of her own children, found it easier to recall that I was her eldest child than the fact that I was called John Grimmer.”
Miss Monday turned away from the window to look into his eyes. “Do you suppose she’ll have trouble with my name?”
“As I said, it was a self-diagnosed condition,” he replied, “Not in any way based on fact. In truth, I suspect she simply disliked me.”
Miss Monday grinned. “I wonder why that might have been,” she said.</Text>

            <Title>Scene 64</Title>
            <Text>I regained consciousness somewhat gradually. I have hazy recollections of those few moments of semi-consciousness. Blurry memories of a brightly lit room. The distinctly muffled voices of the doctors.
I remember being in a bed somewhere, twisting and turning as I woke. My head was pounding, and it was difficult to think. I remember seeing Jack—though it might just as well have been Dr. Karnstein—as I only had vision in one eye, and his face was masked.
I could hear his voice, too, but I could only make out some of the words. My ears felt like they were ringing, and they felt as if they’d been stuffed with cotton.
I heard him call our for someone named Camille. I had no idea who Camille might have been, although looking back it seems obvious that this was Mircalla Karnstein’s real name. I heard him telling her no. No, insistently.
“We have to, Jack,” she said in her thick French accent. “You know we have to.”
I was surprised to hear her use his real name. I knew him as Jack, but I’d assumed that Dr. Karnstein knew him by his pseudonym.
Jack argued with her. “We can fix her,” he said. “It’s not too late, but we must act now.”
Whatever was said next, I cannot recall, but I do remember Dr. Karnstein asking about my eye.
The next time I awoke, I felt immediately as though something was different. There was pain, that was one thing, but that was not the whole of it. The world looked different. It felt different. I could see details I’d never been able to see before. The precision of my eyesight was remarkable. I felt like a blind man being given a pair of spectacles for the first time.
But as I blinked my eyes, I felt a knot in the pit of my stomach. I had the sudden horrific memory of a zombie digging its hands into my flesh and plucking my eye from its socket. There were no eyelashes upon my cheek when I blinked my eye. Instinctively I reached up with my arm to feel for what was wrong.”
Annabel hesitated. Even after unburdening herself of everything she’d told them, she was hesitant to share the rest. She was embarrassed. She hated talking about the mechanical part of her. It made her feel inhuman.
I stumbled out of bed, still unsteady on my feet, and sought out a looking glass. I found one, a small mirror that sat on the nightstand. I picked it up with my good arm—the other one having been ravaged by the zombies—and held it up to my face.
I hardly recognized myself. My hair was knotted and disheveled, as if I’d been asleep for days. My face was bruised. And there was a bright pink gash that ran down my face, intersecting that foreign object that had replaced my eye.
I reached up and explored the device with the fingers of my left hand. I was amazed that I could still see with both eyes. I could see better with that one eye than I could with the other. The effect was dizzying. Unfamiliar. I felt my way around the device with my hand, searching for a latch or a button that would released the contraption from my face.
Eventually I found one. There was a clicking sound and the hiss of air releasing. Instantly my vision changed. I could only see with my left eye now; I was at once relieved and disturbed by the sudden change.
I felt nauseous. I began to remove the straps that kept the prosthesis in place. At last, I looked away. I could not yet bear to look at my face without at least something covering the gaping hole where my eye had been removed. There was searing pain when I moved my good eye to look away.
And there was Jack, standing in the doorway.
“How do you feel?” he asked me.
For a long time, I did not answer him. I thought the answer must have been obvious, anyway. I felt horrid. Couldn’t he see? I’d lost my eye. And as I thought of those sick and wretched faces I’d cut down as they’d tried to devour me, I believed I’d also lost my soul. I hated him for sending me in there.
“You did well,” he said.
I snorted. If that were true, I thought, I would not have lost so much.
“What have you done to me?” I asked eventually. I held out my mechanical eye, practically shoving it in his face.
“I’ve saved your life,” he said. And though I couldn’t see his face through his mask, I could tell he was smiling. It was in the tone of his voice. He was proud of what he’d done. He wasn’t talking about the clockwork eye, though. Somehow, Jack had saved me from the virus. He said that it should have killed me, should have turned me into a zombie. I didn’t understand what it meant that I had survived the zombie infection.
“It meant you had some natural immunity,” said Palmer. “And having survived your infection, it is possible you are now immunized against the virus. Your blood holds the key to the cure for Lazarus.”
“Possibly,” Annabel admitted.
“What happened to Papa Doc?” asked Jonathan.
“I don’t recall,” Annabel answered.
Her memory was mostly blanks. But in truth, she knew exactly what became of him. She knew, because she remembered planning it, before she blanked out. Like a fallen angel, with black wings drenched in blood, she descended onto Papa Doc’s balcony and broke into his home. And waking him by softly calling his name, she placed the zombie upon his bed and let it crawl towards his face.
After a while, I heard the sharp sound of Jack’s footsteps as he turned and walked down the hall, away from me. And for a long time, I did not see him again. Until recently.
Annabel looked directly at Jonathan Grimmer. She looked at Abraham Palmer, and Kipper Lockwood, Kass, and Rémy. It was strange that these people—these strangers—had become her allies in so short a time. Annabel didn’t trust easily. She had little choice but to trust them now.
“The man I knew as Jack Bernhardt goes by another name these days. You know him as Anthony Tidkins, The Resurrection Man.”
Stunned silence followed Annabel’s revelation. In the quiet, still house, they heard a distant scream from outside. It sounded like Roderick Steen’s voice.</Text>

            <Notes>It was not my arm, but the arm of a machine. Well, you’ve seen it, and you know what it looked like, so I won’t describe it to you again.

MAPLECROFT: DRAFT ZERO
Posted on | 2 days, 20 hours ago, around lunchtime | No Comments
Here’s recent progress on my fin de siecle gothic epistolary about Lizzie Borden fighting Cthulhu with her trusty axe, now with Bonus! ghosts, guilt, arcane science, and an accidental villain who’s losing his mind and his humanity in tandem:
		
		Project: Maplecroft
		Deadline: October 15, 2013
		New words written: 8737
		Present total word count: 112,080 words ￼
		  Things accomplished in fiction: Draft. Zero. Y’all. The end is a little fiddly, but it’s whole. Next up: I’ll polish up that bad-boy until it shines…but not yet. I’m too close to it. I need to take a step back, work on other things for a few weeks (or months, I don’t know – I have time, thank God) … and then go back to it with a clearer head. Things accomplished in real life: Daily jaunts around the neighborhood with the dog; lots of yardwork; got more work done on the house’s exterior and now we’re watertight, baby; grocery shopping; ran to the post office; ran to the bank twice; cleaned house a time or two; went back and forth with the historic zoning office; returned yet another lost dog to his appropriate yard; did two phone interviews; did a bunch of paperwork; paid a bunch of bills; went to the pet store to stock up on food/toys/treats; and you know what? I can’t even remember what all else has gone down in the last week. Other: If you’re keen on such things, you can read my zombie western vignette “Reluctance,” which has been reprinted (and is free for the reading) over at Apex Magazine. There’s also an interview with yours truly over there – go check it out. Bonus! other: Finally cracked 100k words for the year. I’m a bit behind my goal of averaging 1k per day, but right now, I’m at peace with that. And now I’m going to go be at peace with a snack, a drink, and maybe an afternoon nap. I do believe I’ve earned it. Number of fiction words so far this year: 107,906

HOW CAN YOU SAY, I GO ABOUT THINGS THE WRONG WAY
Posted on | 1 week, 2 days ago, mid-afternoon | No Comments
I am back from Phoenix! It was wonderful, seriously – it’s absolutely one of the best conventions I’ve ever had the privilege of attending (as a guest or otherwise); but it was also exhausting, in every possible way. Tally it up, y’all: approximately one million fabulous friends, 12-hours a day on a concrete floor, plenty of paneling, lots of signing, no small amount of shopping, a three hour time zone shift, and a full day of travel at the start and end.
It was glorious, though. I met some amazing readers, got to touch base with a number of distant chums (if all too briefly, at times), and many shenanigans did occur with Team Capybara. But you know that already – if you kept up with the tweets. Or perhaps the pictures. GLORIOUS, I say.
Right. So.
In short, I’m still playing catch-up from those four days out of town. It is positively amazing how much can back up to surprise you, even over a holiday weekend – I swear to God.
I spent half of yesterday answering email, and the other half running errands – I went to the post office, the bank, the grocery store, Ace, and Walgreens. Today wasn’t much different, except I did less running around; mostly I did load after load of laundry, unpacked All The Things, and began the task of restoring the yard. Because if you think that less than a week in late spring in the south cannot send a yard straight to hell, then you have another thing coming.
To be fair, the husband mowed the grass – and the rest had been allowed to “go” a bit before my travel … but everything needed a good watering, many things needed a major pruning, the hedge needs a serious trimming, and the weeds were starting to organize into crabby little nation-states.
Okay, most of that stuff still needs to be tackled in earnest; but I got a serious start on about half of it, and then it was time for me to lie down inside and close my eyes. It was 90 degrees out there, and I am only human. Or somewhat less than that, after carrying around bags of mulch and toting loppers and food and insecticide and running the wheelbarrow up and down the hills and dragging the garden hose in a number of directions. By the time I’d done all that, I was more drippy-faced sweat-monster than woman.
Oof.
Anyway. I think all the birds are fledged and gone. I will wait another day or two before tossing out the (now very very dead) flower basket, just to be sure. The roses got chewed on by something, but I’ve cut them back and corrected the problem. I got lunch with my husband. I did some bits of assorted housework apart from the laundry. I walked the dog, and let him smooch all over a few (wildly delighted) kids and a very nice lady who was working on her garden. I went back to Walgreens to pick up a prescription and a shower cap because my old one developed a crazypants case of smelly-ass mold while I was out. (I am kind of confused about that.)
In other news, my dad and stepmom adopted two Great Danes while I was gone – via a rescue agency near Nashville – and I am happy for them … both the dogs and the dad/stepmom, whose Dane passed away a few years ago at the ripe old age of twelve. I am led to understand they went there to adopt ONE dog. I am also led to understand that my dad is a big fat sucker. Yes, well. The record will reflect that it runs in the family.
Greyson will be THRILLED to meet the new guys, and I can’t wait to make it happen. Maybe later this summer.
At any rate, this brings us all up to date on all the exciting adventure-type things … so I’m going to log off, finish the dishes, put away supper leftovers, and maybe get to work on some of that writing business that hasn’t happened in a week, now. Much to my chagrin. Have a good foreshortened week, everyone – and please forgive me if I’m a little absent from the ‘net for the next couple of days. I might try to wrap up that draft of Maplecroft before it’s out.

PHOENIX OR BUST!
Posted on | 2 weeks, 2 days ago, in the early afternoon | No Comments
Tomorrow morning, bright and early, I’m heading out for Phoenix Comic Con! And though the trip itself will be long and boring, the weekend promises to be a blast. So come out and see me! Here’s my schedule.
Also, here’s my Twitter feed. I link it here, because the odds are very high that I won’t be doing any blogging – just snapping selfies and other assorted shenanigans, and uploading it all for your amusement.
So! Tune in, show up, be amused. That’s my suggestion. And for now … I’m outta here!

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>His was truly a face that only a mother could love. And even she might have preferred him if he’d been pretty. It wasn’t as though he had a hideous disfigurement, an amputation, a scarred face or blemishes. Mostly, what it came down to was a total absence of handsome features.
His chin, average. His eyes, pale. His cheekbones, just so slightly too high. His lips, just a bit too thin. His body, under muscled, weak.
It was mostly that amalgam of subpar features that made him unattractive. But then, as if the universe felt that he had gotten off easy, it had also bestowed upon him another burden of physiognomy. Albinism. If merely being unhandsome wasn’t enough to make him a pariah, his unnaturally white hair, pale skin, pale and rose-hued eyes would always do the trick. More than that, he also had a heightened sensitivity to sunlight, frail health, and a steadily increasing number of various phobias.
Knowing all this, one might assume that Anthony did not have a happy childhood. This assumption would be folly. In spite of the odds being stacked against him, Anthony did at least have a few tools at his disposal, which he used to great effect, not to make a great deal of friends, but at least to make a few that were uncommonly loyal. It was not just his intelligence, his perspecaciousness, or his curiosity that made him interesting to his loyal circle of friends. Mostly, it was his fearlessness.
He curled his hand into a fist. “What did you call me?” he demanded.
The boy sneered. Here was a boy half his size, frail-looking and weird. Parasol in hand, dark glasses over his eyes.
“You're gonna fight me?” he said with a laugh.
“Yes,” said Anthony, folding his parasol in preparation for the altercation.
“Don’t,” said one of Anthony’s entourage. Under his breath, his friend whispered a cautionary reminder. “You’ve never won a fight before. Not one.”
Anthony laughed. “Maybe this will be the first,” he said.</Text>

Plot [edit]
Early in the American Civil War, rumors of gold in the Klondike have brought would-be prospectors to North America's Pacific Northwest. Anxious Russian investors commission American inventor Leviticus Blue to create a machine which can mine through the ice of Russian-owned Alaska. Blue's "Incredible Bone-Shaking Drill Engine" (or "Boneshaker" for short, named after boneshaker bicycles of the era), instead destroys several blocks of downtown Seattle and releases a subterranean vein of "blight gas" that kills anyone who breathes it and turns some of the corpses into rotters (non-supernatural zombies). A wall is erected to contain the gas within the affected part of the city. Leviticus Blue is nowhere to be found.
Sixteen years later, Leviticus's wife and son, Briar and Zeke (Ezekiel) Wilkes, live in the impoverished outskirts of the former metropolis. Life is difficult, but Briar manages to support herself and Zeke by working a physically demanding blue collar job. However, one day, Zeke enters the toxic city in search of evidence proving his father is innocent of the intentional destruction. Briar intends on following, but the drainage hole collapses in an earthquake. She then hitches a ride over the wall by a captain of an airship, the unnaturally tall Captain Cly. Meanwhile Zeke meets Rudy, a man who claims to be a highly decorated lieutenant. Rudy tells Zeke that he can lead him to his parent's former house. The pair of them encounter a Native American woman who lightly wounds Rudy, but they manage to elude her.
Briar is attacked by rotters, which causes her to flee to the roof of a building, where she is rescued by Jeremiah Swakhammer and his Doozy Dazer. He takes her to a bar named in honor of her deceased father to meet people including the barkeeper, Lucy O'Gunning. Once again, rotters attack the bar, forcing the occupants to retreat. It is later revealed that a man named Minnericht caused the rotter attack. Lucy takes Briar to see Minnericht, believed by some to be Leviticus Blue. Briar, however, doubts this. Unbeknownst to her, Minnericht has taken Zeke hostage. A battle breaks out between Minnericht's men and Swakhammer, Lucy, and the Indian princess. This battle attracts the rotters, complicating Briar's efforts to reunite with her son and exit the dangerous area of Seattle.
Swakhammer is found unconscious and in critical condition by Briar. She tries to make Minnericht help him, leading to a heated argument in which Briar renounces that he is Leviticus, and mocks him. Unbeknownst to Minnericht, the Indian Princess is behind him, and while Briar distracts him she comes, slits his throat, and kills him.
Everyone reunites and escapes to the surface. Eventually Briar leads Zeke to her and Leviticus' old home and tells Zeke that she killed Leviticus Blue years ago, as he tried to escape Seattle with his Boneshaker. Briar shows her son Blue's mummified body, still inside Boneshaker. Zeke claims he doesn't hold any grudge against his mother for killing her husband, and they embrace, before leaving to loot what is left of the former Blue residence.
Authorial intent [edit]
Boneshaker is the first novel in Priest's "Clockwork Century" setting. She has affirmed that with Boneshaker she sought to create a literary magnum opus for the steampunk movement, stating "Steampunk, I think, has been hunting for that for a while."[2]
Film [edit]

            <Title>Scene 63</Title>
            <Text>While he walked, his mind was at work. Bailey wandered the sidewalk, sniffing for owls and perking his ears up at the sound of distant crickets. Night had fallen.
Occasionally, they heard the sounds of zombies in the distance, and Roderick tightened his grip on his cane.
A corvine bird perched on the archway of a house.
“Quoth the raven,” Roderick muttered.
Bailey continued to sniff the ground, and Roderick paced anxiously beside him. “Just do your business, my boy. The sooner we get back inside, the better.”
Though Bailey had been inside all day, the smell of the city had changed so drastically, he was too unsettled to mark his territory just yet. He needed to explore a bit first. Roderick’s neighborhood seemed deserted, so he let the dog be, but kept a tight hand on the leash, and kept his eyes and ears open.
“Good lad, don’t you think, Bailey?” Roderick said, thinking of Rémy.
He sighed wistfully. The boy obviously adored him, and Roderick felt a pang of guilt for leading him on. Guilt coupled with longing. It was not that Roderick didn’t return his affection. But Roderick’s mind was occupied by more than just romantic affections. He didn’t have time to allow fickle things like love to distract him. There were zombies about.
Zombies. The word still felt foreign on his tongue. It still felt impossible. While many people were quick to accept the supernatural, Roderick was a sceptic. Belief in the supernatural was not merely normal; it was in vogue. In a city where spiritualist mediums and fortune tellers could be as famous as actors and actresses, Roderick’s skepticism was a rarity. Fashionable men and women had seances to contact their loved ones from beyond the grave. Ghosts, vampires, werewolves. What reason did anyone have to doubt their existence?
As for Roderick, his father had been a policeman, as well as an alcoholic. Edward Steen had made a modest salary as a detective at Scotland Yard, in spite of his inability to refuse a glass of whiskey when one was proffered. He’d retired young, if retirement was the right word. The truth was that he’d drank himself out of a job. Roderick’s wealth was not inherited; it was earned. Roderick hadn’t seen his father in years, and almost never thought about him. It was strange that Roderick should think of him now.
Edward Steen was superstitious. He believed that murderers were possessed by devils, that sin was a gateway for demons to cross over into our world. Perhaps that was exactly why Roderick was so steadfastly logical. Perhaps this was also why he never let a drop of liquor touch his lips. Edward Steen had always preferred cats to dogs, drink to drugs, and superstition to logic.
But then, what if an irrefutable fact presented itself, one which explained the logic behind the superstition. If pragmatism must prevail, then Roderick was forced to consider that even myths may have a foundation in truth. Here, in this city, Roderick had seen the dead rise. He had seen them feast on the flesh of the living. If he could not trust his own eyes, what could he trust?
Roderick tried to shake off the curious sensation that he had fallen down a rabbit hole and was likely to open his eyes and find himself in his own bed at any moment.
“Bailey,” he called.
Silence greeted him in return. The leash had somehow slipped from his hand. He swore, cursed himself for letting his mind wander.
No jangling collar. No scampering feet. No hyperactively sniffing snout. Just the unnerving silence of Dead London. He whirled around, seeking any sign of his furry friend. A single flickering gas lamp cast long shadows onto the square brick buildings that lined the road. It was nearly dawn, but the street was still dark.
“Bailey,” he called again.
A layer of fog drifted along the cobblestones. He heard a sound that might have been Bailey’s collar and spun in the direction of the sound. He saw only a chain attached to a locked gate, rattling in the wind.
“Bailey, where have you gone, boy?” he called out into the dark.
He stood, helpless, on the side of the street, his arms wide, imploring, calling Bailey to him.
Finally, a sound broke through the unnerving silence. The movement of feet. He followed the sound, despite the danger of wandering an alleyway alone in a city plagued by the dead.
Throwing caution to the wind, he stepped into the alley, following the footsteps into the darkness. His eyes still adjusting to the gloom, he made his way through the alley almost entirely by sound alone. The footsteps stopped, but he followed them, until he nearly walked straight into their source.
A man stood there, still mostly indistinguishable in the darkness. His back was to Roderick, and in this dim light, he was more shadow than man. But perhaps he’d seen his dog. Perhaps Bailey had followed his scent in search of a new playmate.
Speaking of scent, even Roderick could have followed this man’s scent. He must have been living in this alleyway; even in the stench of London, the man’s smell was potent. He smelled sickly. Like walking death.
Roderick felt a knot beginning to form in the pit of his stomach. An unsettling chill that came not from the night’s cold breeze, but from the fear that crept up his spine. Fear that this man was not living.
“Sir,” he said, desperation overcoming his fear. “My dog,” he pleaded. “Have you seen my dog? He must have come this way.”
The man didn’t turn. Not right away. Just kept on chewing. Yes, he was eating something. Chewing noisily. The scent of fresh meat penetrated even the homeless man’s own sour stench of sweat and rot.
“Please,” said Roderick. “My dog—”
Finally, the man turned.
Roderick recoiled. His face. It was covered in blood and meat. He could see that, even in the darkness. Blood and meat. His teeth, glistening, red, chunks of meat between his teeth. Chewing noisily upon gristle and flesh. In his hands, a ravaged handful of meat and wet fur.</Text>
            <Comments>Is it the next day?
Before the dog was sniffing at birds and squirrels, I don’t personally recall seeing too many squirrels out at night.  Just noting that the time of day is unclear based on the bits of information.
oh no!  Poor Bailey.</Comments>

            <Title>Scene 11</Title>
            <Text>Without a suitable location to dock the Penny Dreadful, Jonathan had been forced to disembark via rope ladder, while the ship remained floating above. With a sense of vertigo made worse by a head dizzied by absinthe, he’d climbed down to the ground below. He’d signalled to the ship, then made his way on foot.
Distance, time, and drink had already managed to calm Jonathan’s nerves, and although he’d had a gun pointed at his head and jumped out the window to escape a gang of masked men, he was beginning to feel that he’d overreacted. In a city as big as London, it was unlikely the Resurrectionists —other than Grundy—knew who he was. He had escaped. He might sleep with a pistol by his bedside for the next few days, but as far as he was concerned, he was in the clear. What he should do now was go home, and climb into bed. Still, he was here now. It was not out of the ordinary for Jonathan to drop in on his friend, even unannounced.
“Roderick, open up, it’s me!” he called at the door.
He heard Bailey yipping in excitement. The door swung open, revealing a familiar, friendly face. Roderick Steen wore a painter’s smock, and, so far as Jonathan could tell, nothing else. A young, smooth-skinned man stood a few paces behind Roderick, looking mortified.
“Jonathan!” Roderick exclaimed happily, greeting him with a hug and a kiss on the cheek. Bailey upped the ante by whining with excitement and dancing in circles.
“Roderick,” Jonathan replied. “I’m sorry to come calling at this hour, and without sending a card.”
Roderick dismissed the apology with a wave of his hand. “Nonsense!” he said. “What use are such formalities among old friends? Come in, make yourself at home. Rémy here was just leaving.”
“I was?” asked the French model, but with a withering look from Roderick, he picked up the remainder of his things, gave Jonathan a look of furious jealousy, and stormed past him.
Roderick put a hand firmly, but gently, on Rémy’s wrist, halting his progress at the door. With a whisper, he promised that they’d pick up where they left off soon enough. “And I’m not speaking entirely of the painting,” he said with a wink.
Rémy went beet red at that, but he smiled and allowed Roderick to plant a kiss on his cheek. He swept past Jonathan, apparently now satisfied that Jonathan did not represent competition.
When he was gone, Roderick gave a weary smile and said, “Sorry about that.”
Roderick turned on his heel and swept into his living room, giving Jonathan a glimpse of his posterior. Jonathan made no comment; they’d been friends long enough that Jonathan wasn’t exactly shocked by the view. He watched as Roderick lifted a small wooden box from his bookshelf, and offered him a sampling of its contents.
“Is that snuff?” he wondered.
“Cocaine,” Roderick explained with a roguish grin, and put a bit up his nose by way of demonstration. He inhaled sharply and let out a whoop of exhilaration. “Sigmund Freud swears by it, you know. Calls it a magical substance. And indeed it is! Wonderful. No side effects, and not at all addictive—though I can’t seem to give it up,” he added with a laugh. “Are you familiar with Freud, by the way?”
Jonathan indicated that he wasn’t and declined the offer of the magical substance with a shake of his head. Roderick set the box back on the shelf. He took a seat on the divan, while Jonathan settled into the settee.
Roderick’s tastes inclined towards the excessive, the decadent, and the ridiculous. His furniture was ornate, decorated in brightly colored floral prints, not to mention an excess of tassels. His walls were papered in a yellow and red striped pattern. An enormous chandelier hung from the ceiling, spilling candlelight across the wide expanse of Roderick’s sitting room. Furs were draped over the furniture. Roderick was a loud proponent of the aesthetic movement. Though Jonathan was well acquainted with this fact, he still managed to be overwhelmed by Roderick’s decor and boisterous manner whenever he called on his friend.
“Sarah Bernhardt uses it as well, which—truth be told—was my real reason for giving it a go. Do you know Sarah Bernhardt?” Roderick continued, speaking rapidly. “Fabulous woman, you simply must meet her. I’ll introduce you, but you must first promise me you won’t fall in love with her. Most men do, it seems, and I’m afraid she’d be a bad influence on you. Given your own reputation, that is saying something.”
“Very well then,” Jonathan replied, winking. “I promise.”
“Somehow I don’t believe you,” Roderick said. “But listen to me ramble. You’ve just returned from Prague, haven’t you? I was so sorry to hear about your father.”
“Thanks, Roderick,” he said. He sighed. He should have called upon Roderick sooner.
Roderick crossed one leg over the other, patted the empty space on the divan, inviting Bailey to leap up beside him. He scratched his dog’s head and studied Jonathan’s face. He quieted, and said, suddenly grave. “Something tells me this isn’t a social call.”
Jonathan started. “What do you mean? Of course it is.”
Roderick scoffed. “You’re a terrible liar, Johnny, old boy. Now, tell me, what has happened?”
Jonathan sighed. It was one of the problems with associating with a man as perceptive as Roderick. Nothing slipped past him.
“Must I?” he protested. “There’s a new opera playing this evening. I believe it’s still early enough to catch the late showing if we leave now. Or perhaps a night of gambling at my club?”
Roderick had brightened at the mention of the opera, but he shook his head.
“I’m afraid my interest in gossip outweighs my inclination to attend the opera. I must insist—”
“Alright, alright,” Jonathan said. “But it’s really nothing worth fretting over.”
Roderick listened intently as Jonathan summarized the events of the evening. He began with the pair of letters that Jonathan believed tied Connor to the Resurrectionists, and ended with his narrow escape through the window. Roderick, for his part, listened attentively, his meticulously plucked eyebrows furrowed with concern as Jonathan explained.
Roderick, Jonathan knew, had often been called in to advise the police on particularly difficult cases. This arrangement had begun with the theft of an obscure piece of art, Roderick being generally considered an art expert, and had continued when the police had discovered that Roderick’s expertise was not in any way constrained to the art world. Roderick was a true polymath. He had made a study of a broad number of subjects, his interests changing temperamentally. He had a practically eidetic memory.
A few years ago, a series of gruesome murders made headlines, and the police had called on Roderick to help them find the culprit responsible. Roderick had been unable to catch the killer, but he had been useful, at least, in narrowing down the list of subjects. The killer, he had told the police all those years ago, was most likely a member of the scientific society known as the Resurrectionists.
Before these murders, there had been a number of rumours going around about a few prominent scientists; none of these rumours were ever proven, and after it came to light that a Resurrectionist was to blame for the murders, they went underground, abandoning the gentleman’s club that once served as their base of operations. As Roderick had once told Jonathan, this only served to confirm their guilt.
After relating his story to Roderick, Jonathan watched his friend’s face for a reaction. They sat in silence for a matter of minutes, while Roderick’s face ran through a variety of expressions ranging from worried, to thoughtful, to downright frightened.
“So,” Roderick said at last. His tone was neutral. Jonathan was unaccustomed to such gravity in his friend’s voice. Frankly, it worried him. “The Resurrectionists most likely believe that you are responsible for Lord Connor’s death.”
“That seems likely,”Jonathan said. “Of course, they might not even know who I am. I was masked, after all.”
“Jonathan, the Resurrectionists are not to be underestimated. They will come after you, kill you if they can, discredit you if they can’t. We can’t be certain they didn’t recognize you; we can only assume they do know who you are.”
Jonathan frowned. “In a city as big as London? You flatter me; I’m not that famous.”
“Jonathan, you fly around in an airship with your family’s name on it,” said Roderick. “And what about Grundy? He saw you with your mask off. You introduced yourself by name.”
Jonathan shrugged. “Well, yes, there is that. So we track down Grundy, make sure he didn’t tell the other Resurrectionists about me.”
Roderick said nothing. He had that look on his face that he often got when he was lost in thought. Jonathan knew that look all too well. A minute passed in silence as Roderick continued to stare blankly. Suddenly, he sat up.
“Not just Grundy,” he said. “We need to learn the names of each of the Resurrectionists, and turn them in to the police.”
Jonathan let out a guffaw. “Oh, is that all?” he said, and sighed. “Thanks, Roderick, you do know how to cheer me up. So, there isn’t any hope for me, then? I’m a dead man walking?”
“I’m serious,” said Roderick, and if Jonathan didn’t know him better, he’d have believed it. “I know, I know. But this isn’t the sort of thing one takes lightly. We are going to unmask the Resurrectionists, once and for all. Each and every last one of them.”
Jonathan gave Roderick a doubtful look as if to say, you’re high, and to be fair, he was. But Roderick returned the expression with a critical expression of his own, all arched eyebrows and neck angled so as to ensure he was looking down his nose at Jonathan.
“What else are you going to do?” Roderick demanded. “Sit back and wait for them to come after you?”
Jonathan let out a sigh. Sometimes it was easier just to humour Roderick when he was like this. He should have known Roderick would be dramatic about this whole nasty business. Eventually, Roderick would lose interest and turn to some other pursuit. In the meantime, Jonathan could learn what he could about the Resurrectionists, not because he felt they were after him, but because he still wanted to write his article.
“Fine,” he said. “Where do we start?”
“Ah!” Roderick exclaimed, startling Bailey out of his seat. The terrier began barking excitedly, pursuing his own tail as if it was the source of all the commotion. “Ah! Now there’s a good question. Where do we start?” After a moment, then said, “I suppose you’ll have to consult an expert.”
“But you’re an expert,” Jonathan countered, as Roderick left his seat again and disappeared into the adjacent room. “You’re the expert.
“Not really. When I consulted for Scotland Yard on the Resurrectionist murders, I consulted an expert of my own. A fellow eccentric with an exceedingly keen interest in murder. Parson Sinews,” Roderick explained, calling to Jonathan, who remained in the sitting room.
“Sinews is a collector. He keeps broadsides and other memorabilia from famous crime scenes, and visits the sites of all the worst murders. When he can, he arranges to meet with the villains themselves, before they’re sent to the gallows. The more gruesome the murder, the keener his interest. He is said to own a ledger, made from the skin of William Burke. How’s that for ironic? He has a length of the gallows rope used to hang Mary Ann Cotton. Supposedly he has an original Ripper letter in his possession.”
“And you want me to meet this, this, murder enthusiast?” Jonathan called.
“Yes, well, he knows more about the Resurrectionists than anyone else in London, myself included. If we hope to mount a war against them, we’ll need Mr. Sinews’ assistance, I’m afraid.”
With that, Roderick returned to the sitting room, dressed now, as if he was going out. He wore a brightly colored blue ascot, an ivory frock coat with blue buttons and embroidered with silver thread, and a pair of blue kid gloves.
Jonathan got up.
“We’re not going now, are we? Surely we’ll wait till morning?”
“You’re going now,” Roderick told him, selecting a top hat from a rack containing numerous options; the one in question was made of dark plum felt, with a blue ribbon. He placed it on his head and checked his reflection in the looking glass. He nodded his approval, snatched up an umbrella from its rack, and added, “Mr. Sinews keeps strictly to night hours. If you wait till morning, he’ll be in bed.”
“And I’m to call on him unannounced?” Jonathan asked.
“I’ll write you a card,” said Roderick. “He’ll be more than happy to receive you, I’m sure. You have a gun, by the way?”
Jonathan’s eyebrows went up.
“My father has a gun collection on the Penny Dreadful, remember?” he said, alarmed by the question. “Should I expect to need one?”
“No, of course not,” Roderick said, laughing off the question, “But you might want to take one, just in case.”
When Jonathan assured him that he would, Roderick relaxed. He armed himself with a revolver and headed for the door.
Roderick paused to write up the calling card; he had stationary on the credenza by the door. He pressed the card into Jonathan’s hand.
“I’ve introduced you by your pseudonym,” he said, meaning that he’d written Mr. O on the card.
“Wait, where are you headed? You’re not coming with me?” Jonathan asked.
“I had planned to attend Lord Connor’s masquerade ball, you know, but time got the best of me. It often does, you know? Still, better late than never, as they say. I’m sure my friend the detective will be there by now. I’ll do my best to make sure your name doesn’t come up in conversation. One more thing…” Roderick added.
“Yes?” Jonathan prompted.
“This Mr. Monday you mentioned. Where does he fit in?”
“I don’t know yet,” Jonathan admitted, “I’m not even sure he does. He didn’t seem to know of Connor’s connection to the Resurrectionists. He might have just been in the wrong place at the wrong time. Whatever the case, if the Resurrectionists were to learn that he was there when Connor died, they will likely come after him as well.”
“Then Monday may be a useful ally,” Roderick suggested.
“I don’t think so,” Jonathan told him. “Monday is dangerous. Unpredictable. And honestly, a bit frightening.”
Roderick grinned. “Tell me more. I think I might like him.”</Text>
            <Notes> At first, Roderick had felt a guilty sort of glee at his friend’s drama - Lord Connor, Resurrectionist was indeed a dramatic headline - but as the story unfolded, his excitement turned to concern for his friend.

He abandoned his smock and began dressing himself. He added a brightly coloured blue ascot to the ensemble, which he complemented with an ivory frock coat with blue buttons and embroidered with silver threads, and a pair of blue kid gloves.

He selected a top hat from a rack containing numerous options; he chose one with a hint of violet, placed it upon his head, and checked his reflection in the looking glass. He nodded his approval, snatching up an umbrella from its rack.

“See,” he said, gazing at his reflection and taking up his earlier conversation. “I don’t look a thing like Sherlock Holmes.”
“I don’t think he was talking about your appearance,” he argued in his Bailey voice. “Most likely he was referring to your work as a detective. Honestly, Roderick, are you incapable of accepting a compliment?”
Roderick gave a sigh of feigned annoyance. “I hate it when you’re so logical, Bailey,” he said. He picked up the dog affectionately and let Bailey nuzzle up against his chest. “You’re right, I suppose. It must have been meant as a compliment. Even so, I loathe the comparison to that imbecile, Holmes.”

Roderick was right. He thought about what Monday had said of his plan to escape via airship - that the ship would draw attention, while the point was to avoid it. Worse, the name of the printing company was printed on the balloon of the ship; if it had been spotted, it would lead the Resurrectionists straight to him. The Resurrectionists were dangerous. He couldn’t afford to do nothing.</Notes>

Plot [edit]
London, April 1878. Shadowhunters William Herondale and James Carstairs find the dead body of fourteen-year-old Emma Bayliss in an alley. They also find a dagger imprinted with two snakes each biting the other's tail, an ouroboros, probably the weapon with which she was murdered.
Southampton, May. Tessa Gray arrives at the Southampton dock aboard the Main, expecting to find her brother Nathaniel waiting for her. Before, Tessa was living in New York with her Aunt Harriet, but her aunt had died recently and her brother asked her to come stay with him in London. At the port, Tessa finds the Dark Sisters, Mrs. Dark and Mrs. Black, instead of her brother, who have a letter from him saying that he could not meet her because of business, but that the sisters will bring her to him. Tessa goes with them.
Six Weeks Later: Tessa has been held prisoner by the Dark Sisters. They have been training her to Change (a process by which she takes on the appearance of someone else, living or dead, by holding something that belongs to them). This time Tessa becomes Emma Bayliss and relives her last few moments alive. The sisters are impressed and tell Tessa that they have been preparing her for an arranged marriage to a mysterious individual known as "the Magister." They expect the marriage to take place that day or the next. The sisters leave and Tessa tries to run away but is caught by the Sister's coachman. Tessa is tied to her bed, but she attempts to escape again by using the Change. Just as she escapes her bindings the door opens - It is William, who followed the trail from Emma's body to an organization called the Pandemonium Club and the Sister's house. Before Will can explain himself, Tessa hits him with a jug and injures him. After a confusing first introduction including Will cursing at her, quoting poetry and comparing himself to the fictional character, Sir Galahad, Will declares that he will help Tessa escape. The Dark Sisters catch up and a battle begins between Will and two other Shadowhunters who came with him, in which Mrs. Black is killed, and Tessa is knocked unconscious.
Tessa awakens in the London Institute to find herself being examined by Brother Enoch, one of the Silent Brothers, who informs her that she is a shape-changer and a Downworlder. Tessa meets the inhabitants of the Institute. The next morning Jessamine takes Tessa shopping; Charlotte and Henry look for Tessa's brother; and Will and Jem inspect the Sister's house. They find a clockwork automaton wrapped in human flesh. A vampire called de Quincey is revealed to be The Magister. Later, another vampire, Camille Bellcourt, comes to the Institute and informs them all that de Quincey throws parties where he tortures and killed humans for entertainment; something which is breaking the Law. If the Shadowhunters can observe de Quincey breaking the Law at one of these parties, they can attack. Camille admits that her motives for coming forward was to meet Tessa; she has become very talked-about in Downworld, and reveals that Tessa's brother may be with de Quincey. Will and Tessa decide that the only way that they can attend the party without causing a stir is for Tessa to attend the party disguised as Camille, with Will posing as her human companion. Camille also says that her lover, the warlock Magnus Bane will attend the party with them for assistance.
At the party, Magnus informs Will and Tessa about some plans for a demonic clockwork army found in the library, but they are forced to join the other vampires in another room before they can discuss the matter further. The room is set up to host one of de Quincey's 'performances' but as the human is revealed to be Nate, Tessa blows her cover in an attempt to save her brother. Will summons the other Shadowhunters, who fight and kill the vampires. Will confronts de Quincey as he attacks Camille/Tessa, and bites him, mocking him and asking the vampire how it feels to be on the receiving end of one. Infuriated, De Quincey manages to escape, and Will accidentally consumes some of the vampire's blood because of the bite. They also save Nate and bring him back to the Institue. Back at the Institue, he and Tessa share a passionate moment when she brings him holy water to drink to cleanse his body of the vampire blood, but he abruptly ends their kiss and sends her away. Unaware of these events, Jem cheers up Tessa and takes her to his favourite place in London, where they are attacked by members of the Magister's clockwork army. They make it to the Institute, but Jem collapses before he can open the door. Tessa manages to alert the Shadowhunters inside, but not before one of the clockwork figures smears his hand with the blood from Jem's injuries. The figure waves in a grotesque manner before retreating. Later, Tessa is summoned to Jem's room, and he explains why he collapsed earlier; when he was living in China, a greater demon broke into their home and tortured Jem in front of his parents as an act of revenge against his mother, who had raided the demon's nest and killed its babies. They tortured him by constantly feeding him a demon drug that caused him to hallucinate for days. He was found by some other Shadowhunters, but his parents had been killed. Jem admits that his body is now addicted to the drug and he has to take some of it every day, causing his skin, hair and eyes to pale to a silver colour, and without it his body cannot function. He did not take any when he was out with Tessa, which was why he collapsed. He also tells Tessa that the drug is killing him, but when Tessa asks him why he does not simply give up his dangerous profession, he declares that "there are more things to life than not dying". The following day, most of the Shadowhunters leave to kill de Quincy in his hideaway in Chelsea. Mortmain, the mundane who informed the Shadowhunters of de Quincey, comes back to the Institute to tell Will and Jem about the Dark sister who is trying to help the Magister with his army and her location. They rush off to kill her, leaving Nate, Jessamine and Tessa alone. Mortmain comes back with the clockwork army, using Jem's blood from the clockwork figure's hand to gain access, and reveals himself as the real Magister. Nate reveals himself as Mortmain's accomplice. While Thomas tries to fight the clockwork automatons off, Tessa, Sophie and later Jessamine escape to the Sanctuary, but Mortmain tricks Jessamine into opening the door. Tessa agrees to marry Mortmain to spare Sophie and Jessamine's lives. Mortmain, believing he has won, agrees, but once the army has left the room, Tessa stabs herself in the heart and falls into the fountain.
Will rides back once he realizes he and Jem have been tricked, leaving Jem to ride the carriage with only one horse, slowing him down. When Will arrives at the Institute, he's just in time to witness Thomas' death and after thanking him for everything that he has done, goes on to look for Tessa and the others. While Jem arrives, he runs straight into Nathaniel and his four clockwork automatons, two of them holding Jessamine and Sophie; one holding the Pyxis, a box that holds demon energies needed to revive the automatons. Nate orders the army to kill him - Jem fights them off, but Nathaniel and the Pyxis can flee. During that, Will finds Tessa and finally allows himself to break down and mourn her death. Tessa then awakens in his arms and reveals that she tricked the Magister into believing that she was dead by changing just before she pretended to stab herself; she changed into a gunshot victim she had previously changed into before with The Dark Sisters, which meant that the woman's blood poured down Tessa's chest, looking like she had wounded herself. The other Shadowhunters return, after killing de Quincey, who laughed at them for mistaking him for The Magister. After Thomas and the others are buried, Tessa thanks Charlotte for her hospitality, but assumes that she is going to be asked to leave. Instead, Charlotte asks Tessa to stay, a request which she accepts. Tessa goes to Will wanting to have a serious relationship after he confirmed his feelings for her in the Sanctuary, but he cruelly suggests that they will not have any relationship, also pointing out the fact that as a warlock, she is not able to bear children. Tessa is horrified because this is the first time that she has heard this, and runs away from Will. Jem finds and comforts her, saying that although she feels that she is unlovable because she is not human, "the right man would not care," subtly declaring his feelings for her. (Jem is completely unaware of the complicated romantic relationship between Tessa and Will.) Tessa gratefully accepts Jem's comfort, but does not completely realize the sincerity behind his words. The story concludes with a deeply distressed Will turning up at Magnus Bane's house asking for help, but it doesn't say what the problem is until the next book.
Characters [edit]
Major Characters [edit]
Theresa "Tessa" Gray
16-year-old Tessa crosses the Atlantic Ocean to live with her brother Nathaniel in London after their aunt's death, having lived her whole life in New York City. Her parents died in a carriage accident when she was three years old. She is quite tall, has brown hair and gray-blue eyes. She loves to read books, escaping to the fictional world. She loves her brother more than anyone else and has always tried to protect his innocence. She is said to be a Downworlder, having the ability to shape-shift. She enjoys reading.
William "Will" Herondale
William has a fiery character, he is ferociously sarcastic and seems to find life infinitely amusing and infinitely tragic at the same time. He's described as having the face of a bad angel and blue eyes like the night sky in Hell; his hair is a wavy black. His mother was a mundane, leading to his father's leaving of the Clave and the Shadow World for his love for her. He was brought up somewhere in Wales, but he left his family and arrived at the London Institute at the age of twelve. He is seventeen years old and has a dark past that he must keep hidden to protect everyone he loves. Will enjoys gambling, drinking and being around women with questionable virtue, as much as he enjoys everything else. James is his parabatai and, so it seems, the only person he seems to care about.
James "Jem" Carstairs
Born and brought up in the Shanghai Institute, he is half British and half Chinese. His parents were killed by a demon called Yanluo when he was eleven. The demon tortured him in front of his parents, feeding him a demon drug to which he became addicted. This drug weakens and drains the life out of him, leading to his physical appearance: frail, slender, silver hair and eyes and very pale skin. He's very intelligent and sensible and seems to be attracted to Tessa. He's seventeen years old and his best friend, and parabatai, is Will.
Jessamine "Jessie" Lovelace
Jessamine's parents, like Will's, left the Clave to live a peaceful life, but they died in a fire. She was brought to the London Institute as an orphan then, though she seems to hate everyone living there and generally everyone who's involved in the Shadow World. She wishes to find someone with whose help she can escape the Institute to live a normal mundane life, though she can fight with her razor-sharp parasol Henry invented for her. She's described as being very pretty, having blonde hair and brown eyes; she's seventeen years old. Her mind is described by Tessa to have a sharp bitterness and longing.
Charlotte Branwell
Charlotte's parents ran the Institute before her, and after their death, Consul Wayland assigned her to run it at the age of eighteen. She's very small and has dark brown hair and eyes. 23-year-old Charlotte tries her best to care for the orphaned under-age Shadowhunters who live under her roof as well as she can, while having to run the Institute without her husband's help. She wants the others to respect her, but the Enclave often disrespect her authority because she's a woman, so she has to try hard to be heard.
Henry Branwell
Henry has ginger hair and has hazel eyes, he is married to Charlotte and the original leader of the Institute. He always lingers in his laboratory in the cellars of the Institute, experimenting and inventing new things which almost always seem to fail. He is the one to examine the clockwork automatons and find de Quincey's signature on them.
Downworlders [edit]
Alexei de Quincey
	•	Species: Vampire
	•	Gender: Male
Alexei de Quincey is the head of the London vampire clans. Lady Camille Belcourt reports to the Nephilim that he is killing mortals at his parties, which breaks the Law. In the past, de Quincey had killed one of Camille's lovers because he was a lycanthrope. Alexei has been shown to harbor romantic intentions toward Camille. Magnus Bane also suggests that de Quincey would like to be "more than friends" with him, as well.
Lady Camille Belcourt
	•	Species: Vampire
	•	Gender: Female
	•	Hair Color: Blonde
	•	Eye Color: Green
Lady Belcourt is a vampire baronness. In 1878, she is the lover of Magnus Bane. She is also an informant for the London Institute. Because Alexei de Quincey killed her lycanthrope lover, she tells the Nephilim that de Quincey commits murder at his parties. She does this for a chance to watch Tessa shapeshift into her form.
Magnus Bane
	•	Species: Warlock
	•	Gender: Male
	•	Hair Color: Black
	•	Eye Color: Green
Magnus Bane is the lover of vampire Lady Camille Belcourt. Tessa uses her shapeshifting ability to take the form of Camille and attends a party at the home of London head vampire Alexei de Quincey along with Will Herondale, who is pretending to be her human pet. Magnus Bane acts as their guide through the house, helping the Nephilim determine that de Quincey has violated the law. During this, he admires Will's blue eyes and black hair, calling it his favorite combination. This does, of course, match Alec's appearance over a century later.
Mrs. Black
	•	Species: Warlock
	•	Gender: Female
"The Dark Sisters" is Tessa's name for Mrs. Black and Mrs. Dark, the two sisters who abduct her in order to teach her to Change. They claim to be keeping her brother Nate prisoner as well, using this to motivate Tessa. They plan to sell her into marriage to "the Magister" until the interference of the Shadowhunters. Mrs. Black was beheaded and therefore killed by Will while he was rescuing Tessa from the Dark House.
Mrs. Dark;
	•	Species: Eidolon demon
	•	Gender: Female
"The Dark Sisters" is Tessa's name for Mrs. Black and Mrs. Dark, the two sisters who abduct her in order to teach her to change. They claim to be keeping her brother Nate prisoner as well, using this to motivate Tessa. They plan to sell her into marriage to "the Magister" until the interference of the Shadowhunters. Mrs. Dark went missing, but reappeared later on, revealing that though her sister was a warlock, she is an Eidolon demon, a shapeshifter. Unlike Tessa, however, she can not "become" those whose appearances she takes on. The demon that was Mrs. Dark is attempting to use necromancy to bring her sister back to life.

Nate is mundane.
Axel Mortmain
	•	Species: Human
	•	Gender: Male
	•	Hair Color: Gray

A shrewd businessman, he sold his trading company and purchased a company in London that manufactures mechanical equipment used in clocks. He named the business Mortmain and Company, also called Mortmain's.
Emma Bayliss

One night, when she went outside to sew by the light of the gas lamps, she was murdered. Her body is discovered by Will and Jem. Emma Bayliss was presumably murdered by a member the Pandemonium Club, possibly "The Magister" himself.

The Somnambulist is a 2007 fantasy/horror novel set in the late Victorian period, and is the debut novel by Jonathan Barnes. The protagonists Edward Moon, a conjurer and detective, and his silent partner The Somnambulist, a milk-drinking giant who does not bleed when stabbed, are called to investigate a murder that may tie to the poetry and prophecies of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and the fate of London.

            <Title>Scene 66</Title>
            <Synopsis>Rémy, Jonathan, and Monday search for Roderick. Rémy runs ahead of them.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Rémy was first out the door. Jonathan called out to stop him. In the corner of his eye, he saw Miss Monday’s teacup fall to the floor and shatter as she abandoned her chair.
“Rémy, wait!” she called, but the young man was already out the door and headed into the street.
Even the ground was rotten—fallen leaves, wet with rain, squelched under Jonathan’s feet as he hurried after them.
“Stay here!” he called to Palmer, Kass, and Lockwood, who halted at the door. “We’ll be back in a moment.”
He was already losing Miss Monday and Rémy, whose silhouettes were disappearing into the fog and the dark. Dawn was beginning to break, a vermilion streak across the horizon, while the slender sickle-like blade of a crescent moon still hung from the sky, but the fog seemed to devour all light. It gave everything a yellowed appearance, like an aged photograph.
“Which way did the scream come from?” he asked, when he managed to catch up to Monday. “Are you sure we’re headed the right way?”
As if in answer, they heard another scream. If there had been any doubt that it was Roderick’s voice, that doubt was gone now.
“Roderick!” Rémy cried, and tore down the street in pursuit of his lover.
“Quiet,” Jonathan hissed. “Are you trying to wake the dead?”
That expression took on new meaning. So far they’d been lucky not to run into any zombies in Roderick’s neighborhood, but the dead were around. They were everywhere, wandering like ghosts through the shadows. The inhuman sound of distant, hungry moaning had become a soundscape as constant as the striations of crickets in a cornfield, each voice blending with another. The sound was punctuated only by the occasional screams of the living as they either ran for cover or were eaten alive. Whatever had made Roderick scream was probably a zombie.
But Rémy carried on, heedless of Jonathan’s warning, abandoning caution and tearing loudly down the street, his leather boots slapping against the stone street as loud as gunshots in the near-silence.
“He’s going to get himself killed,” Miss Monday hissed.
“He’s going to get us killed,” Jonathan said. “Are you armed?”
Miss Monday rolled her eyes—including her clockwork prosthesis—and raised her crossbow. “What kind of question is that?” she asked. “Have you met me?”
“Come on then,” Jonathan said.
They hurried after Rémy, hoping they weren’t too late to save Roderick, and that Miss Monday’s prediction wouldn’t come true.</Text>

            <Text>“He raised his glass glimmering pallidly in the light—his words, his manner, fascinated me, and a curious thrill ran through my brains. There was something spectral in his expression too, as though the skeleton of the man had become suddenly visible beneath its fleshly covering—as though Death had for a moment peered through the veil of Life...”

            <Title>Scene Two</Title>
            <Text>He felt foolish for buying into the dream logic. But it had felt so real. He’d looked into her eyes. He’d heard her voice, seen her lips moving, smelt her perfume.
But it was impossible.
“Are you awake?” said a voice.
He sat up in his bed and looked around. Most of the past few days had passed by in a fog. He could hardly remember where he was let alone recall how he’d gotten there.
It was a prison cell, with iron bars as walls, a thin slot in the door for food to be slid through. His bed was a slab of wood barely enough to accommodate his height, with a mattress thin enough he swore he could feel the splinters in the wood beneath it. He had no pillow to speak of, but he did have blankets, and he’s folded them up into a pile and used them as one, so that he was cold and shivering when he awoke.
“Who’s there?” he said.
The cell beside him was too dimly lit to make out the shadowy figure from within, but he could see that there was someone in there, speaking to him.
“Ah,” said the voice, as the shadow moved toward him, “You are awake. You know, you talk in your sleep. When you suddenly go silent, I know you are awake.”
“Or dead,” suggested Sinews.
The man laughed at the suggestion. “No,” he said, “I knew you were not dead. This place will not kill you so easily.”
Finally, the man’s face appeared between the bars, and Mr. Sinews could make out his features. He was old, for one, but he’d been able to determine that from the quality of his voice. So the wrinkled visage and the purplish bags beneath his eyes were expected. The man also had a gentle disposition, if the look of a man could give any such indication. There was a kindness in his eyes, and the hint of a smile on his face, that seemed sincere.
What sort of prison was this, where they locked up kind, old men?
“Parson Sinews,” he said.
“Ah,” said the old man, broadening his smile, “Isn’t that interesting? Father Faria, at your service. Though the guards seem to know me as ‘The Mad Priest.’”
“Parson by name,” he said with a bitter laugh, “Not by profession.”
The priest nodded. “I see, I see,” he said, “Still, it’s a bit amusing, isn’t it? A priest and a parson, side by side.”
“How did you end up here?”
The priest shrugged. “I suppose it must have been political,” he said. “My teachings failed to line up with their agendas.”
“Whose agendas?”
“Ah,” said the priest, “Isn’t that the question?”
Parson got out of bed and stretched his neck as he moved toward the iron bars that separated their cells.
“What sort of prison is this?” he asked.
“Ah,” said Faria, scratching his beard as he talked, “It’s a very special kind of prison, is what it is. A political prison, in a way. It’s a prison for those who are known to be innocent but who know something too dangerous to be let out. You’re here because they didn’t know what else to do with you.”
“But I don’t know anything dangerous,” Mr. Sinews protested, “I don’t know what I’m doing here, and I don’t know knowledge it is that I’m supposed to have.”
“Don’t you, though?”
“No,” said Mr. Sinews, “And anyway, if this is a prison for the innocent, what am I doing here? They said I was guilty. They said I was to be hanged until I was dead.”
“But you aren’t guilty, are you?”
“No,” Mr. Sinews admitted, “Not directly.”
“Right,” said the priest, “You know you’re innocent. And so do they.”
“But who is they,” he demanded, “I still don’t understand.”
“Why don’t you tell me everything that happened?” said Faria, “Everything leading up to this point. And then, I will tell you why I think you’re here.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene 10</Title>
            <Text>“What was the meaning of that, do you think, Bailey? Comparing me to Sherlock Holmes, really!” Roderick Steen scoffed. “I cannot understand the comparison. Was the implication that I am an alcoholic? That I have a predilection for narcotics? Or was there an accusation of homosexual tendencies?”
Roderick was standing before a canvas, making long brushstrokes in light colors and occasionally pausing to gander at his subject. Rémy was handsome, fair of skin and hair, thin but tall. He was also naked, as was Roderick, with the exception of his painter’s smock.
Rémy gave him a strange look. “Do you and Bailey often discuss literature?” he asked. His accent was thick, but his command of English was strong. “I’m sorry, by the way. I only meant that you are perceptive, like Holmes in the stories. I meant it as a compliment.”
Bailey, meanwhile, tilted his head, quizzically, to one side, listening to the conversation but not participating in it.
“Constantly,” Roderick answered, answering the question and disregarding the apology. “Now, hold still. It’s difficult enough to capture your face without you moving about.”
He tore his eyes from his subject for a moment to notice the sardonic expression on Bailey’s face.
“Oh, come now,” said Roderick, “Don’t tell me you failed to detect the homoerotic subtext in The Hounds of the Baskervilles? Sherlock and Watson? You really thought their relationship was entirely platonic?”
Bailey raised his eyes in what must have been surprise.
“What? Oh, you’re thinking of my own relationships?” Roderick protested, somewhat annoyed at having to defend himself, even if he did have a young naked man in his loft even as they spoke. His attention was half focused on the painting and half on the conversation.
“Well, yes, perhaps there have been a few gentlemen in my life with whom I may have entertained somewhat of a romantic friendship, but these were mere trysts—with the possible exception of mon chere Rémy. Still, that’s hardly the same as the epic romance of Sherlock and Watson, is it? No offense, Rémy. Besides, I’m an artist, not a detective.”
As he said this, he renewed his efforts at painting Rémy, with a fury of brushstrokes as if to hammer home his point. The annoying thing was that Sherlock Holmes, in A Study of Scarlet, complained when Watson once compared him to Dickens’ Inspector Bucket. So when Roderick objected to being compared to Holmes, even his objections helped to solidify the comparison to the fictional detective. But Roderick couldn’t help it.
And so, he took Bailey’s tacit silence as a reply. Turning around to look at Bailey, he leaned over, allowing his companion to give him a small kiss on the cheek.
“You’re a good boy Bailey,” he said, rubbing Bailey’s head. “Yes, you are,” he said with affection. “Yes, you are.”
He stood up and wiped his face. “Although you’re a terrible kisser,” he added. Then, raising his voice an octave in impersonation of Bailey, he protested, “No, I’m not.”
A poor act of ventriloquism really, but Rémy giggled appreciatively. Perhaps it was Bailey’s facial expression that amused Rémy.
Bailey was a Yorkshire Terrier, a particularly inquisitive breed if not a handsome one, with a shaggy coat and an impressive moustache that far surpassed his master’s. While the breed was not generally preferred by the upper or middle classes, but was bred to catch vermin, Roderick had fallen in love with Bailey’s exuberant personality. Not to mention his ridiculous facial expressions.
Roderick scolded Rémy for moving. It was difficult to paint while the boy kept laughing whenever Roderick said something mildly amusing. Silly lad.
Roderick regarded his painting. Rémy’s complexion was that of an ivory statue, with soft rose colored lips—not unlike that of Oscar Wilde’s famous Dorian Gray. Like Basil Hallward, Roderick hoped to capture Rémy’s very soul in this painting. Roderick had a remarkable eye for detail, and he wouldn’t be satisfied until the likeness on the canvas was a perfect match for the beautiful young man posing on the divan. The painting was still only half finished, but Roderick was not remotely satisfied just yet. Roderick sighed, as he began packing up his painting supplies.
“I believe we’re finished for the day,” he told the model, who looked relieved not to have to sit still any longer, but saddened to be departed from Roderick’s company. He gathered up his clothes and began to throw them on. He tried to steal a glance at Roderick’s work. Roderick distracted him by kissing him, full on the lips. It seemed to do the trick.
“Admit it,” said Roderick, when the kiss ended. He raised his voice an octave in impersonation of Bailey, “Best kiss you ever had.”
Rémy stifled another laugh. A knock came at the door, and Rémy looked at Roderick in surprise and—if Roderick didn’t know better, he’d have said—jealousy.
“Are you expecting someone?” he asked.
“No,” he said, looking as suspiciously at the door as if it had just sprouted fangs and attempted to bite his neck. He went to answer it—Roderick refused to employ any household staff, given his preference for privacy.
“Clothes?” prompted Rémy.
“Ah, good point,” said Roderick, patting his bottom and not finding any trousers there. “What would I do without you?”</Text>
            <Comments>It was indicated in the room that there are two people, and from the start of the chapter I assumed that Bailey was the quiet young boy, but here is indicates that he is a dog.  Was this done on purpose?  I just suggest maybe indicating that the dog is also in the room, that way when the reader comes to this line it can be understood better.
Ah, this is confusing. I like how you wanted to wait to reveal who the heck Bailey was, but it was hard visualizing who Roderick was talking too and the boy... I would re-work the beginning and the reveal. Maybe the boy gives more weirded out looks towards Roderick?
-Jordan
Jonathan needs to show up in this scene; he shows up unexpectedly, with news of Lord Connor’s murder and asking for help (they are old friends). Roderick directs Jonathan to Parson Sinews, who has been digging up dirt on the Resurrectionists. Roderick decides to check out the crime scene. Also, he is an artist rather than a detective. His family has titles (Lord Roderick Steen), but no wealth, hence his need to work. Need to change this around quite a bit.</Comments>

            <Title>Scene 65</Title>
            <Synopsis>Roderick realises that Bailey is still alive, but he is surrounded by zombies. He tries to barge through a door. </Synopsis>
            <Text>Roderick screamed. His vision swam as he blinked back tears and choked back the vomit that threatened to spill from his throat. 
Bailey, he thought in horror. Oh, god, Bailey!
He turned and fled. It was all he could do. It was too late to save his furry friend.
Behind him, a dead man shoveled mouthfuls of meat and fur into his mouth, and Roderick could still hear him chewing. It was deafening. He lost his footing, fell to the ground, head-first. Slammed into the hard stone, but barely felt it. He scrambled to rise, but he hurt more than he realized. It was difficult to move.
He felt a warm tongue on his face and reeled back in panic, and screamed again. In a moment, he was back on his feet and was turning to flee. But as he ran, he spared a glance back at the creature that had licked his face. Standing there, wagging his tail happily, was Bailey.
He blinked in confusion. He looked back at the zombie who still stood there, noisily chewing. He looked back again at Bailey. Unharmed. Untouched. Whatever the zombie was eating, it wasn’t his dog.
“Good god, Bailey, you worried me!”
Confusion turned to relief. He reached down and scooped up his dog into his arms, cradled him like a child, and Bailey returned his affection as dogs do, licking the dirt from his face.
“Must have been a rat,” he muttered. London was teeming with rats, now fat with the flesh of the dead in their bellies.
But there was little time to rejoice in his reunion with Bailey. The dead man had finished his meal and had begun to advance toward the duo, mouth still bloody but clearly still hungry.
Roderick turned to flee, and nearly stumbled into another shadowy figure, which blocked his path and snarled.
He stepped back. There were more of them behind the zombie nearest him. In each direction, at least a dozen of them shuffled forward in the dark. His screams must have drawn them.
Bailey in his arms. He drew his gun and fired six shots. Six bodies fell, and his gun was empty. He drew his cane-sword.
The dead men continued to close in, climbing over the bodies of the fallen, while Roderick continued to back up. He inched further from one cluster of zombies but closer to the other. But as he backed up through the dark, foggy alleyway, he spotted a door.
The side door to some shop, or somebody’s house, Roderick wasn’t sure which.
He put his hand on the knob and tried the door. He swore. It was locked.
The wood was old, splintered, the doorknob flimsy. Perhaps he could force it open. Not with Bailey in his arms though. He set the dog down. The zombies continued to move in on them.
“Stay,” he said, sternly.
Then he slammed into the door, putting his shoulder into it. It looked like the flimsy, structurally unsound sort of door that might cave in under a hard shoulder-check, but the door did not yield. He tried again, slamming into it with all his weight.
Bailey began to bark.
Again, Roderick slammed into the door, and again, it refused to budge.
Meanwhile, the dead men closed in, shuffling slowly on limbs stiffened by rigor mortis.
Bravely, Bailey tried to fend them off with his bark, yapping loudly to ward them off. Still, they advanced, paying him no mind, even as he snapped at their ankles. Roderick shouted at him to stay, but they weren’t interested in Bailey. Not with Roderick so close they could almost reach out and touch him.
“There’s a good dog,” he said. “Keep them busy, my friend. This is it. One last shot.”
He stepped back as far as he could and aimed once more for the door, putting everything he could into it.</Text>

Plot summary [edit]
The story follows the plot of Sense and Sensibility, but places the novel in an alternative universe version of Regency-era England where an event known as “The Alteration” has turned the creatures of the sea against mankind. In addition, this unexplained event spawns numerous “sea monsters,” including sea serpents, giant lobsters, and man-eating jellyfish.
The wealthy Henry Dashwood lives on his estate, Norland Park, with his second wife and their three daughters - Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret. Dashwood embarks on a journey to discover the source of The Alteration, but is fatally mauled by a hammerhead shark. Upon his death the estate passes not to Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters but rather to Mr. Dashwood’s son John, the child of his first wife.
Before expiring from his shark wounds, the elder Dashwood asks John to take care of his stepmother and half-sisters. John initially agrees to do so but is soon swayed by his greedy wife Fanny into giving the girls nothing at all. John and Fanny move into Norland, prompting the scorned Dashwood women to seek living space elsewhere.
Mrs. Dashwood’s cousin Sir John Middleton invites her to stay at a cottage situated on an archipelago off the coast of Devonshire. Although Devonshire is considered to have England’s highest concentration of sea monsters, Mrs. Dashwood accepts the offer and the four women relocate to a windswept shanty known as Barton Cottage. Here they are treated kindly by Sir John, who invites them to dine at his heavily-fortified manor house on nearby Deadwind Island. They are soon introduced to Sir John’s family and friends, including his wife (a former island princess whom Sir John kidnapped and carried back to England and makes an escape attempt every couple of weeks), her mother (also kidnapped by Sir John and now calling herself “Mrs. Jennings”), and Colonel Brandon, a quiet and reserved gentleman who is also a part-man, part-squid mutant.
The move to Barton Cottage serves to separate Elinor from Fanny’s brother Edward Ferrars. The unassuming and somewhat unremarkable Edward is clearly attracted to Elinor, and she to him, but Fanny makes it clear that their wealthy mother would never tolerate a marriage between Edward and the poor Elinor, insisting instead that he be married off to a woman of high rank and great wealth. Edward visits Elinor at Norland just before the move, and his reserved behavior makes her wonder if he is truly interested in her. His subsequent failure to visit her at her new island home only reinforces this suspicion.
In contrast to Elinor’s woes, Marianne soon finds two suitors. Colonel Brandon is smitten with her, but she finds his age (35) and his tentacle-covered face to be repulsive. While out for a walk, Marianne falls into a rain-swollen creek and is attacked by an octopus. She is saved by the handsome John Willoughby, a dashing adventurer and deep-sea diver who has come to the archipelago to visit his aunt. The two of them are soon inseparable and Elinor begins to suspect that the two are planning on getting engaged. Unfortunately for Marianne, Willoughby is suddenly called away to the undersea city of Sub-Marine Station Beta, leaving her heartbroken and alone.
Edward Ferrars finally pays a visit to the Dashwoods at Barton Cottage, but his continued unhappiness and reserved nature lead Elinor to decide that he no longer has feelings for her. Given her mother’s sorrow at being banished to the forlorn Devonshire coast and Marianne’s sorrow at being abandoned by Willoughby, Elinor decides that she must hide her own sorrow for the good of the family.
Elinor is soon dealt a double shock when Lady Middleton’s cousins, Anne and Lucy Steele, come to visit. While out rowing, Elinor and Lucy are attacked by a fearsome sea serpent known as the Devonshire Fang-Beast, and the two barely escape with their lives. In the middle of the desperate struggle, Lucy informs Elinor that she has been engaged to Edward for more than four years. Elinor again hides her true feelings and wishes Lucy the best; secretly, she believes that Edward is only engaged to Lucy out of a sense of honor and duty and hopes for the two of them to somehow break the engagement.
To cheer up the two elder Dashwood sisters, Mrs. Jennings offers to take them to Sub-Marine Station Beta. (There was an earlier Sub-Marine Station Alpha located in the Irish Sea, but it was destroyed by a treacherous merman.) The Station is a massive iron and glass undersea dome housing a large city, public gardens, shops, and a research laboratory where scientists plot new ways to defeat their aquatic enemies. Here Marianne attempts to renew her courtship with Willoughby, only to find him cold and unresponsive to her advances. When Willoughby leaves Marianne to fend for herself against an attack of giant lobsters, she demands an answer from him, and gets one: she learns that he is engaged to the very wealthy Miss Grey, news which leaves Marianne devastated. She admits to Elinor that she and Willoughby were never officially engaged, but his attentions towards her led her to believe that he loved her and would eventually marry her.
Meanwhile, the truth about Willoughby's real character starts to emerge; Colonel Brandon tells Elinor that Willoughby had seduced Brandon's ward, fifteen-year-old Eliza Williams, and then abandoned her in a most cruel way - playfully burying her up to her neck in sand, then leaving her. Colonel Brandon was once in love with Miss Williams' mother, a woman who resembled Marianne and whose life was destroyed by an unhappy arranged marriage to the Colonel's brother.
The Steele sisters arrive at Sub-Marine Station Beta along with John and Fanny Dashwood, Edward, and Edward’s mother. Lucy is overjoyed when Edward’s mother prefers her to Elinor, but her happiness is soon ruined when Anne lets it slip that Edward and Lucy are engaged. Edward is immediately disinherited and his fortune passes to his brother; however, Elinor and her friends respect Edward’s choice of love and honor over money. Colonel Brandon offers Edward a modest income as a lighthouse keeper to help him get started on a new life.
The vacation at Sub-Marine Station Beta is abruptly ended when schools of swordfish begin ramming the glass dome in the hopes of breaking it. They eventually succeed with the help of a narwhal and other sea creatures; the Dashwood sisters and their friends barely manage to escape before the dome breaks and floods. While riding an emergency ferry to the surface, Elinor encounters Edward’s brother Robert and is disheartened to see that Robert cares more for his newfound inheritance than for the fate of his brother.
The sisters and Mrs. Jennings retire to the Cleveland, a houseboat owned by Mrs. Jennings’ son-in-law (and Sir John’s fellow mercenary) Mr. Palmer. Soon after arriving, a depressed Marianne is attacked by mosquitoes and develops malaria. The Palmers leave for their own safety, and only after they are gone does Elinor realize the sudden danger they are in; the area around the Cleveland is home to the bloodthirsty Pirate Dreadbeard, and Dreadbeard’s friendship with Mr. Palmer is the only thing keeping them safe. Without Palmer, the Cleveland and the Dashwood sisters are at the mercy of the pirates. As Marianne is deathly ill and unable to move, Colonel Brandon volunteers to swim to Barton Cottage and return with Mrs. Dashwood. This leaves Elinor and Mrs. Jennings to defend the Cleveland.
Hearing of Marianne’s illness, Willoughby journeys to the Cleveland and helps Elinor booby-trap the vessel; he also explains that when torn between love of Marianne and the lure of Miss Grey’s wealth, he chose the latter and was deeply regretful about it. Willoughby departs just as Pirate Dreadbeard and his men arrive. Elinor and Mrs. Jennings bravely defend their ship, and Elinor summons a swarm of octopi using a special whistle that she has obtained from Willoughby. Dreadbeard’s men are soon massacred by the tentacled monsters, while the Pirate himself is killed by the returning Colonel Brandon.
Marianne recovers from her malaria. Elinor passes along Willoughby’s confession, and Marianne admits that she could never have been truly happy being married to such a selfish man. She points out that the combination of her wish for death and her deadly illness was morally equivalent to attempting suicide, and resolves to model herself after Elinor.
A servant reports to the Dashwoods that Mr. Ferrars has married Lucy. Elinor is overcome by pain and visions of a five-pointed star; upon reflection, she realizes that the pain and visions have been with her (and always appear most forcefully) whenever Lucy is around. Sir John surmises that Lucy must be a sea witch - a monster that seduces human men and sucks the marrow from its victim’s bones. Before Elinor can form a plan to save Edward, he arrives at Barton Cottage. The Dashwoods learn that it was Robert Ferrars, not Edward, that married Lucy. They resolve to leave Robert to his terrible fate, feeling that he deserves it.
The happy occasion is literally upended when the island upon which Barton Cottage rests suddenly rises from the ocean; it turns out to be not an island at all, but rather a monstrous sea-beast known as Leviathan, awakened from a long slumber and hungry for all sorts of marine life.
The characters survive their sudden upheaval from their former island home. Edward reconciles with his mother and asks Elinor to marry him; and she agrees. The couple begin a simple new life tending to the lighthouse at Delaford. Marianne resolves to become a marine engineer so that she can design a new Sub-Marine Station Gamma dome. Despite herself, she comes to fall in love with Colonel Brandon, and the two eventually marry. Willoughby, somewhat to his dismay, is forgiven by his aunt for his treatment of Eliza and reclaims his inheritance. He realizes that had he married Marianne for love instead of Miss Grey for money, he would have eventually attained both love and money. Instead he is left to ponder what might have been.
Promotion [edit]
The novel was initially announced via a YouTube video[1] on 13 July 2009; it has had over 300,000 views since it was uploaded. It features cover art similar to its predecessor—in that it appears to take a work of art and transform it into the theme of the novel. However, with Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters, the image is created by the artist.
Reception [edit]
Entertainment Weekly gave Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters a rating of B- (in contrast to a rating of A- for Pride and Prejudice and Zombies), wondering "(c)an it be that in the rush to turn a charming book novelty into a renewable resource, the whole Austen-and-monsters series has already jumped the shark?"[2]
The AV Club gave the novel a favorable review and a grade of A-, approving of Winters' "aggressive approach to transforming his assigned text into horror" and commenting that "instead of destroying the integrity of Austen’s subtle romance, Winters’ mysterious chanting natives, sea-witch curses, and undersea habitats move the story into a gothic realm".[3]
New York Magazine gave the novel a mixed review, stating that "It’s hard to say, in the end, if this is an homage, an exploitation, a deconstruction, or just a 300-page parlor trick. Although the sea-monster subplots, considered independently, rarely rise above pulp clichés, the book’s best moments do achieve a kind of bizarro symbiosis." [4]

            <Title>Scene 13</Title>
            <Text>Jonathan had grown tired of traveling by airship and had therefore given the ship’s captain and crew the rest of the night off. Captain Merrick had provided him with a flare gun, in case he needed to summon the ship after all.
With the flare gun tucked safely in his belt, and one of his father’s guns on the opposite hip, Jonathan flagged down a passing fly carriage. He gave the driver the address Roderick had printed neatly on the calling card. While not as quick as the airship, a fly was at least quicker than a hansom, and unlike the airship didn’t have the disadvantage of wearing at Jonathan’s nerves. He had enough to worry him already. He patted the pistol at his hip for courage. Roderick had assured him he wouldn’t need his gun, but on the other hand, had been quite adamant that he take one.
So, it was with caution that Jonathan got out of the fly, casting an auspicious eye on the old, gothic house belonging to Parson Sinews. According to his friend, Sinews was an expert on the Resurrectionists. This itself was enough to make Jonathan suspicious. Roderick was not quick to give out praise, especially when it came to intellect. For Roderick, an intelligent person might earn the description not entirely idiotic, and in Roderick’s estimation, this would be high praise. In all the years he’d known Roderick Steen, not once had Jonathan heard him use the word expert to describe someone other than himself. This fact, in consideration of the subject at which Mr. Sinews was an expert, was unsettling. After all, Sinews was a collector of paraphernalia related to the most gruesome murders throughout history. Jonathan shivered as he turned to pay his driver. The man thanked him, but didn’t linger. The horse clopped along the cobblestone street until Jonathan stood alone on the sidewalk. London in this part of the city, at this time of night, was eerily silent.
Not for the first time, Jonathan thought about simply going home and climbing into bed. He expected he would wake up the next morning, feeling like all of this had been a bad dream, and continuing on as if nothing had ever happened out of the ordinary. After all, it was unlikely the Resurrectionists were after him. That was probably just Roderick being dramatic, which was to say Roderick being Roderick.
Then again, if they did know who he was, he needed to know what he was up against. He needed to arm himself with information. Jonathan’s father had often reminded Jonathan that information was a weapon, and one to be wielded like a sword. In that regard, Jonathan was currently unarmed.
He walked up the steps to Mr. Sinews’ house. There was a brass knocker on the door in the shape of a serpent eating its own tail. An ouroboros. A curious thing to have on one’s door, Jonathan thought. He used the brass serpent to knock firmly on the door. A minute passed, and Jonathan thought about turning around and heading back down the steps. It was not too late for him to abandon this fool’s crusade against the Resurrectionists. He decided to knock again, and without bothering to wait, began heading back down the steps, when he heard someone coming.
The door swung open, and a man stood in the doorway. The first thing Jonathan noticed about him was his scars, which lined his face from forehead to chin, intersecting his dark skin with harsh lines of pink. The man’s thickly muscled neck was adorned with a necklace of brass-painted bone. His right eye was red as blood. The left was a vibrant ocher.
Jonathan handed him Roderick’s card. After a moment, he stepped aside to admit Jonathan into the house.
“Right this way, Mr. Grimmer,” he said in a deep baritone. He had just the hint of an accent, Haitian if Jonathan guessed right.
Following him inside, Jonathan noticed that while the man was physically fearsome, he was impeccably dressed, in a perfectly tailored suit and a well-tied cravat. For a moment, Jonathan wondered if this man was Mr. Sinews. After all, Jonathan considered his own family; while they had no titles, the Grimmer family had earned a begrudging amount of respect from at least some members of the aristocracy due to their wealth and business status. Even so, the man who stood before him was dressed better than even Jonathan. But somehow, Jonathan was beginning to think that this was Sinews’ servant, and Mr. Sinews’ wealth eclipsed even the Grimmer family’s fortune.
Once Jonathan was inside, a quick glance around the foyer was enough to confirm this. While the house was in a gothic style, it was clearly a reproduction; the gothic manor was brand new. It was polished, clean, and expensively decorated with foreign imports. Egyptian statues, Persian carpets, and so on. Mr. Sinews’ tastes were both exotic and bold.
The sound boomed and resonated throughout the house as the Haitian closed the door behind him.
“If you’ll wait here, Mr. Grimmer, I’ll let Mr. Sinews know you’re here.”
As the doorman disappeared down the hallway, Jonathan looked around the entryway. It was rude of him to snoop, but his upbringing as the son of a newspaper man, had taught him to be unapologetically nosy. So he looked at paintings on the wall, picked up items off the shelves.
There was a touch of the macabre in every item of Sinews’ collection. The Egyptian statues were of Anubis and Osiris, gods of death and the afterlife. He had specimens in jars and animal skulls on display. Even the rug on the floor featured a motif of skulls. There were broadsides in frames mounted on the walls. There was a lone book on one shelf, and Jonathan recalled that Sinews was supposed to own a book wrapped in the skin of Henry Burke. He allowed himself to wonder if this might be the book in question.
When the Haitian returned, Jonathan was holding a tall jar of clay with hieroglyphic carvings on its lid. He frowned at Jonathan.
“Mr. Sinews has quite the collection,” Jonathan said. “Bit morbid for my tastes, but still, impressive.”
“The world craves the grotesque. Those who pretend otherwise deceive no one but themselves,” said a voice from down the hall. Following a set of soft footsteps on hardwood floor, the voice resolved into a man.
This was Parson Sinews. Jonathan was sure of it from the moment he stepped into the room. He had the bearing of an aristocrat, if not a very god. Frankly, he was the most beautiful man Jonathan had ever seen. Jonathan had a bit of a reputation as a rake, and was guilty of taking too much pride in his own image in the looking glass, but in Sinews’ presence, he felt a bit like Quasimodo in the presence of Adonis. Jonathan’s preference was for women, but he wasn’t blind.
“Mr. Sinews, I presume?” said Jonathan. “You’re not quite what I expected.”
Sinews had all the lean, agile grace of a predator. He was tall, Jonathan noted, only a little shorter than Jonathan. He had dark hair, sable and swept back neatly. He was clean-shaven, and hadn’t a blemish on his milky white skin. But most striking in Jonathan’s estimation were his eyes. They were bright, and wide, almost youthful, for lack of a better word. It was as if an adolescent stared out of the eyes of a man; the effect was unnerving. They were jade in color, and at the moment, they were amused.
“You were expecting some dusty, old Professor type?” said Sinews.
“I’m not sure what I was expecting,” Jonathan told him.
Jonathan noticed that while Sinews was expensively dressed, he wore his clothes with a certain disregard. His vest and shirt were both buttoned only partway up. His collar was not ironed. His sleeves were rolled up. Definitely not what Jonathan had been expecting.
“But Roderick Steen credited you as an expert. And given your expansive collection of antiquities and cultural artifacts, I suppose your description of a dusty, old Professor does match my expectations better than the reality.”
The Haitian handed Sinews’ Jonathan’s card, saying, “This is a Mr. O, according to his card. An acquaintance of Mr. Roderick Steen.”
Sinews’ mouth twitched into a semblance of a grin. “A pleasure to meet you, Mr. O,” he said. “I enjoyed your report on Isembard Kingdom Brunel’s latest work of engineering. Very insightful.”
Jonathan gaped at Sinews in surprise. Given how few articles Jonathan had written and published, he was astonished that Sinews recognised the deliberately vague pseudonym.
“A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Sinews,” Jonathan managed.
“Please, call me Parson. That is, Parson by name, not profession.”
“Then you’re not of the religious persuasion?” he queried, with irony enough in his inflection to counter Parson’s own.
Parson seemed charmed by the banter. “This gentleman is Henry Charles Ocelot.”
Again, Jonathan looked at him in surprise. To refer to one’s doorman as a gentleman was incongruous to say the least. Then again, to judge by Mr. Ocelot’s attire, he could have been a gentleman. It was all very strange.
The introductions apparently over, Mr. Sinews turned on his heels and headed down the hall, Mr. Ocelot gesturing for Jonathan to follow. He took Jonathan’s coat, then followed behind Jonathan as they headed into the adjacent room.
The scale of the gothic-styled household was disorienting in that it made naming each room appropriately near impossible. What might have been a hallway was in Sinews’ home an antechamber. A room that was functionally a den was in Sinews’ home an atrium. His living room, an amphitheatre.
As they entered a broad, circular room with a domed ceiling, Jonathan smelt cinnamon and cardamom, and all manner of exotic scents. Incense and candles filled the room with scent and smoke. The floor was littered with huge, plum-colored pillows in Oriental style. On each of the pillows sat a young man or woman. Their faces were drained of color, their eyes bloodshot. They were thin as if starved. They stared out at the world groggily, as if drugged, drained of animation; not one of them looked up as Jonathan and Sinews entered the room, Mr. Ocelot at the rear.
Jonathan stared at them in alarm. On one occasion, Jonathan’s father had tasked him with paying a visit to an opium den for the sake of an article. It had been a lot like this, seedy and dark, its occupants blind to their surroundings. Their only thoughts were of the poppy. But this room unsettled Jonathan in a way the opium den never had. Somehow, an opium den—for that must have been what it was—in a gentleman’s home was more disturbing than the den on a dark street in Chinatown. There, at least, it was somewhat expected. More disturbing still, some of these waifs were very, very young, barely older than children. Jonathan also noted that there were no signs of the opium itself. Jonathan couldn’t guess what drug it was they were using, but it was not opium. Jonathan could see puncture wounds on their necks, signs that whatever their poison was, it was taken via injection.
Sinews said nothing by way of explanation, and merely carried on toward the next room, apparently expecting Jonathan to follow. Mr. Ocelot watched impassively as Jonathan hesitated. He felt compelled to say something by way of protest. He should have stormed out of Sinews’ house in moral outrage, refusing to accept the man’s help. Instead, he took a few halting steps backwards, then at last let out a long and guilty sigh, and hurried after Sinews.</Text>

            <Title>Scene 43</Title>
            <Text>They arrived the next day at the home of a lawyer whose son was badly ill. As a precaution against transferable disease, Dr. Allen wore a mask. Most doctors wouldn’t have bothered; most wouldn’t have been familiar with Henry Lister’s studies of bacteria and the use of antiseptics. But Dr. Allen read broadly, and kept an open mind to new and experimental methods. He had always rebelled against tradition. There was always room to improve upon established practices. He managed to make a number of enemies with this mindset; most of his colleagues were simply not ready to embrace change. Many still practiced bloodletting. But Dr. Allen had also saved the lives of a number of patients who would have died using old methods.
His mask was old fashioned, a plague doctor’s mask made of worn and faded leather. The doctor’s appearance was frightening, in Anthony’s opinion, but as the door opened, a look of relief passed over the face of the servant who had opened it.
“Doctor Allen,” she said. “Thank you so much for coming.”
She stepped aside so he could enter the house, Anthony following in his wake.
The lawyer was sitting on a bench as they entered. He barely looked up at their entrance, but just sat there, staring at the wall, sweat upon his face. The doctor introduced himself and his assistant; his voice was thick and muffled by the heavy leather mask. The man looked up, briefly, and nodded as if to say, thank you for coming.
The servant swept past them.
“This way,” she said, making her way upstairs to the boy’s bedroom. Anthony followed, letting the doctor lead the way.
They paused at the entrance to the bedroom, while the doctor gave Anthony a cloth mask of his own to put on. Then they opened the door to the stench of stale sickness.
The doctor opened his kit.
“Will we be able to save him?” Looking at the boy in his bed, unconscious, pale and sickly-looking, Anthony doubted it.
Dr. Allen, however, began his examination, not bothering to answer Anthony’s question. He cataloged the boy’s symptoms aloud as he examined him. Occasionally, he would ask for Anthony’s assessment, and the surgeon would nod his agreement.
“We’ll need to operate,” said Doctor Allen, who began by instructing his young apprentice to clean the patient’s body in preparation for the surgery. As directed, Anthony applied an iodine solution to the boy’s stomach in preparation for a laparotomy.
“Scalpel,” said the doctor. A moment later, the tool was in his hand.
Anthony seemed to anticipate his every need. At each turn, the tool he required was ready even before he asked for it. Anthony watched with wide eyes as the doctor cut into the boy. When the job was finished, he cleaned up the doctor’s tools, returned them to his kit, and zipped his bag shut.
“Now what?” asked the lawyer’s servant as they made to leave.
“Now we hope for the best,” Doctor Allen replied.
They passed the lawyer on their way out. He hadn’t moved from his seat on the bench by the entrance to his home.</Text>
            <Notes>- Establish Jack's mechanical tinkering earlier. Have him attend an operating theatre? Have him help with a dissection. Make Dr. Allen more like John Hunter: He should live in and run a medical school, have preparations in jars, be willing to experiment/question established practices/trust only his own eyes, dislike reading, army surgeon - called away for duty?</Notes>

            <Title>Scene 14</Title>
            <Text>The ride to Lord Connor’s mansion was not long. Roderick arrived shortly, exited the cabriolet, and walked the rest of the way up the long drive to the mansion. He had attended last year’s masquerade, and so was familiar with the mansion.
He stepped inside and had to cover his mouth with a handkerchief to avoid gagging. He was unprepared for the overwhelming stench, and nearly lost his lunch. He’d been expecting just one dead body, Connor’s, but there were bodies littering the floor. Dozens of them, in an advanced state of decay. There were a couple of policemen standing in the hallway, examining the bodies, and a couple of burly men helping load the bodies onto carts and hauling them away. The policemen looked up at Roderick in surprise. One of them left off his examination and came over to greet Roderick.
“Detective,” said Roderick.
“Mr. Steen,” he said, a tone of surprise in his voice, “What are you doing here?”
“I came for the masquerade. Have I missed it?” he said, facetiously.
The detective wasn’t amused. “Anyway, it’s good you’re here,” he said seriously. “Perhaps you can be of some assistance.”
Roderick followed the detective, pausing briefly to remove his shoes and socks, a habit which drew stares from the other policemen. Detective Taggert had grown accustomed to Roderick’s eccentricities, and seemed willing to put up with them, so long as he was useful. Roderick had never failed in that regard. As he gradually grew accustomed to the smell, the handkerchief helping to muffle the potent rot, he began to smile cheerfully. There was a puzzle to be solved here, that much was certain. Roderick was delighted. Well, looking around at all the bodies, he was also horrified, but mostly delighted.
“This way, Mr. Steen,” said Taggert, leading the way inside.
He led Roderick down the hallway. Stepping around the bodies, Roderick followed the detective haltingly, pausing to visually examine the corpses. They were stiff and wide-eyed, flies buzzing around them, many of them beginning to rot as if they’d been dead for some time.
“When did this happen?” Roderick asked.
“Earlier this evening, at Connor’s masquerade ball,” Taggert told him.
“Impossible,” Roderick protested. “They’re in a far advanced state of decay. They look like they’ve been dead for weeks.”
“All the same, Mr. Steen, this happened last night. As I said, it’s a good thing you’re here. Frankly, I’m stumped. Perhaps you’ll be able to at least tell us something useful about what happened here.”
Taggert’s men were still busy carting off the bodies, but Roderick was startled to see the sheer number of dead. Jonathan hadn’t said anything about this atrocity, so it must have happened after his friend fled out the window. In a way, he was lucky to have been scared off by the Resurrectionists. Otherwise, he might have been among the bodies lying on the floor. Roderick stepped past them, following Taggert closely as he made his way to the ballroom. While the hallway floor had been littered with dozens of corpses, here the body count was in the hundreds.
“My god,” Roderick said in stunned horror. “What happened here?”
“A plague of some sort,” said Taggert, deeply serious as they surveyed the scene.
Roderick nodded. Perhaps some sort of plague had swept through this ballroom, killing everyone in a matter of minutes. The bodies certainly had the look of those afflicted with a vile illness. They were blemished and had pustulant sores and garishly discolored skin. But for a plague to act that quickly, to kill everyone here in a matter of minutes, it seemed very unlikely.
Roderick’s mind worked quickly. He wondered if the Resurrectionists were somehow involved. Could whatever infection had spread through the ballroom have been cooked up in a laboratory? If so, the Resurrectionists must surely be to blame. After all, he knew they’d been at the ball. It was the first time they’d surfaced since they’d gone into hiding, and if this plague was born of science, it was a remarkable—if abhorrent—scientific achievement. Few scientists would have been capable of the achievement, and fewer still both capable and willing to overlook the moral quandaries of this sort of scientific pursuit. A plague that killed its victims in a matter of minutes…
“Have you questioned the survivors?” asked Roderick.
“Unfortunately, only one survivor has come forward so far. We’re still working on identifying the victims. Once we’ve done that, we have a guest list; we can use that to identify the other survivors, if there are any. It’s slow going, though. There are a lot of bodies, and many of them are almost completely unrecognizable.”
Roderick could see that. Some of their faces were bloated by the disease, and some of their faces were malformed by rot, their skin sloughing off and turning to mush. Just looking at the bodies made Roderick want to gag all over again. The one aspect of his hobby that Roderick didn’t enjoy was looking at dead bodies. Roderick was a bit squeamish.
“And the one survivor who did come forward?”
“The young lady who made the initial report of what happened here,” said Taggert. “You’ll love this.”
Roderick was already interested. He found himself leaning in towards the detective, hanging on his every word.
“She says that she saw a man in a plague doctor’s mask. He apparently used a clockwork bird to spread some sort of poison gas. Upon inhalation, the victims began to cough violently. Within a matter of moments, they were dead.”
Roderick gasped. So he was right! This plague was man-made. And the man had worn a plague mask. Taggert and Roderick both knew what this meant. Their suspect was a Resurrectionist. The fact that the witness had mentioned that the mask was old was even more telling. Could they have at last found their man, the mad scientist harboured by the Resurrectionists when they first went into hiding? Anthony Tidkins.
“This witness,” said Roderick. “I’ll want to speak with her.”
Taggert twirled his moustache in what Roderick felt was a guilty manner, if it was possible to twirl one’s moustache guiltily.
“Miss Karnstein had been through quite an ordeal,” he said. “She wanted to go home and rest. We felt that would be advisable. She was quite young, after all—”
“Did you at least get an address?” Roderick said, cutting off the detective. “Did no one think to ask why she wasn’t affected by this plague like the others?”
Taggert twirled his moustache and frowned. This seemed to answer Roderick’s question.
“Of course not. Why do I always expect you to demonstrate even a minute amount of competence, when I continue to be disappointed?”
“Before you work yourself into a fit, there’s more,” said Taggert, recognising from Roderick’s tone that he was struggling to control his temper.
Perhaps he had been a bit too overzealous with the cocaine, he thought, forcing himself to take deep breaths. He gestured for the detective to continue.
“Miss Karnstein was able to identify the culprit. She believes she recognised him. We’ve sent a dozen Black Marias to apprehend the man. We’ve got him, Roderick,” said Taggert vehemently. “We’ve got him at last.”
“You really think this could be Anthony Tidkins?” Roderick asked. “The Resurrection Man?”
Taggert nodded.
“It’s him. I’m sure of it. I should mention, the suspect named by Miss Karnstein…” Taggert hesitated. “He’s an acquaintance of yours.”
“Spit it out, man, please,” said Roderick, a bit more forcefully than he’d intended.
“Parson Sinews.”
Roderick swallowed.
“Sinews? Really? The man’s a megalomaniac, an eccentric, a crook, a reputed vampire, and worse still, he’s Irish. But a mass murderer?”
The Inspector looked as if he had his own doubts.
But Roderick wasn’t as certain as he let on. If Parson Sinews really was the Resurrection Man, Roderick may have just sent his closest friend to his death. He tried not to look worried, gave the detective a forced smile and a shrug, and hoped that Jonathan would keep his wits about him. At least, Roderick thought, he had insisted that Jonathan bring his revolver.</Text>
            <Comments>Roderick’s last name is Steen?  Any relationship to Edward Steen, who the readers were introduced to at the meeting in the tea house?
This is the same night the murder happened at the ball, correct?  I suppose whatever they used on them is causing them to decay faster than normal?
Roderick should be concerned here; he’s just sent Jonathan to pay Sinews a visit. If Taggert is right, Jonathan is in grave danger.</Comments>
            <Notes>“I’m certain that whoever killed Lord Connor is responsible for unleashing this plague. Therefore, if we can determine who killed Connor, we will have solved both cases,” he said, and Roderick shrugged, though he hardly agreed with that logic.
If both cases were inextricably linked, he should study both. He sighed.
Beginning to make his way upstairs and beckoning for Roderick to follow, the inspector continued to explain more fully the details of the telegram he’d sent Mr. Steen earlier.
“Lord Connor’s study was the last place he was seen alive. Apparently two gentlemen were seen going into Connor’s study during the ball. They entered and left separately, but it is assumed they knew each other.”
“It is?” said Roderick. “Why is that assumed?”
“Well, they must have,” said Taggert, obviously thrown by the question. “Anyway, as they were both wearing masks, nobody can say for certain who they were. We’re continuing to question the survivors in the hope that someone may be able to identify one or both of them. In fact, one survivor, the young lady who made the initial report of what happened here, was able to identify a suspect. She believes she recognised one of the culprits. We’ve sent a dozen Black Marias to apprehend the man.”
“Splendid,” said Roderick. “What else?”
Taggert grinned, knowing that Roderick would love this. “The first gentleman went out the window. Had an airship waiting for him.”[ This is a little confusing.  First gentleman who entered the room was Mr. Monday, who exited from the door, disguised as Lord Conner.  Then Mr. O left via airship.  Might want to make the statement clearer?]
“A bloody airship?” Roderick replied, “And we still don’t know who this man was?”
“We’re still questioning the survivors. I’m sure something will turn up, but it’s difficult, isn’t it? They’re shaken up by what happened here, understandably I should add. Anyway, it’s the other man we should be concerned with. He left through the ballroom, made quite a scene. Apparently had some sort of confrontation[ Left out the Resurrectionists I see.  I assume he did so on purpose.]. Guns were drawn. That’s about when all this happened.” He gestured vaguely to indicate the numerous dead. “We think the confrontation was an attempt to stop him.”</Notes>

            <Title>Scene Four</Title>
            <Text>When all the birds were airborne, a hazy, greenish gas began to trail behind the crows. The gas seemed to dissipate as it fell, but then the men and women and children nearest to it collapsed in a fit of coughing. Those that bent to help their loved ones, if they themselves had managed to avoid breathing the noxious green gas, found their throats ripped open, their loved ones’ teeth upon their necks and their faces.
Hence the screaming.
“We’re too late!” shouted Edward Steen, who was nonetheless fighting his way through the crowd towards the Resurrectionist. As they watched, they witnessed a zombie in a top hat lunge toward him. He disappeared from view.
“Oh, good god!” Mrs. Hatton exclaimed, fanning herself with a delicate paper fan. She was not the sort of woman who would faint at the slightest provocation, but these were trying circumstances.
“We’ve got to help them,” said Henry Charles, removing his overcoat and top hat.
“Are you going to shift?” she asked.
“Best that I do,” he replied, quickly unbuttoning his shirt as well, right there on the steps of the National Gallery.
“I could try to—” she began.
“It’s too risky,” he told her, knowing perfectly well what she was offering to do.
There was no way to be certain that Dr. Allen’s experiments all those years ago had gone as planned. Whether their respective abilities were the predicted results of the experiments, or whether they were unintended, unanticipated side effects. Either way, Henry Charles’ ability was a bit more subtle than Mrs. Hatton’s, though it was painful to accomplish and a bit gruesome to behold. He stripped out of his shirt, and even his trousers, standing utterly naked in the midst of London. His body, muscled and dark, was striped with pink scars like those that marred his face.
Nobody was paying him any mind, as the zombies started to tear into the living and the Resurrectionist stood calmly in the centre of it all, still setting the rest of his clockwork crows into motion.
With a deep breath and the deliberate cracking of his knuckles, Henry Charles Ocelot began the shift. His limbs twisted and realigned, his sinews tore apart and twisted back together again. The awful sound of breaking bones and rending skin made Mrs. Hatton turn away and flutter her fan more aggressively. A lesser woman might have fainted had she been witness to Mr. Ocelot’s shifting. But Mrs. Hatton simply looked away and pretended that nothing untoward was happening.
Henry Charles screamed all the while, but the process was quick, and his screams gave way to growls. Almost as quickly as it had started, it was over. Not wasting any time, he leapt into motion, lithe and predatory in this form.
He ducked amongst the swarming, ravaging dead as they outstretched their limbs in search of anything that still breathed. He leapt over dormant corpses and bounded past a screaming lady whose own pretty daughter was biting into her flesh, and made for the Resurrectionist.
Finally, the Resurrectionist paused in his work, setting the next of his brass crows aside in order to look at Henry Charles. He stepped back warily, putting his hands out as if to ward him off. Silently, crouching low, Henry Charles crept forward on the pads of his feet, readying himself to pounce. Suddenly, the man turned as if to run, but Henry Charles was faster. Much faster.
He leapt, going straight for the Resurrectionist’s throat. He tore into him with sharp teeth. A spray of warm blood gushed from the man’s neck, and he fell to the ground, Henry Charles on top of him.
The zombie turned, the scent of freshly spilled blood drawing their attention. But Henry Charles put one massive paw upon the Resurrectionist’s dying body, protectively. He growled territorially, until the dead men turned away, most likely in search of easier prey. Henry Charles licked his lips, then turning one brown eye and one red one towards his meal, he started to eat.
It was Marianne Hatton’s voice that brought him back. Without that familiar and gentle sound, he might have just carried on eating. Instead, he got to his feet, discarded the rest of his meal. This, at least, was one cadaver that would not revive; the plague mask would have filtered out the poisoned air.
He dared not linger long in the Square. Who knew how little of the gas it took to turn one into a zombie? But as he turned away from his half-eaten meal, he tried to see if he could find Edward Steen.
“Henry!” Mrs. Hatton called. “We’ve got to get out of here.”
It was true. Not only was the tainted air a concern, but there were no more living people remaining for all that he could see, and the zombies were starting to take swipes at him. He was quick, and a ferocious growl was usually enough to deter them, but still. It wasn’t wise to linger here.
Just as he was turning away though, he spotted Edward Steen. He paused, just long enough to get a glimpse of his face, and more importantly, his eyes.
Dead. Edward Steen’s eyes were dead. Dead, but focused on Henry Charles. He moaned hungrily, stumbling through the gore-spattered Square. One of his arms had been severed, gnawed off by human teeth. A painful way to die, Henry Charles imagined.
He whimpered sympathetically, then turned away. With incredible agility, he made his way back to the steps of the National Gallery, where Marianne Hatton was making a stand against the zombies.
Her face was set in concentration and beaded with sweat, and a dozen charred bodies lay smouldering upon the staircase. Smoke and ash and the smell of burning meat filled the air as the bodies burned away. The very air was hot, and the wretches closest to Mrs. Hatton were beginning to smoke. If they got any closer to her, Henry knew they’d be set ablaze.
The real danger with Mrs. Hatton’s pyrokinesis was that she herself was not immune to the flame. As with Henry Charles’ shift, when Mrs. Hatton used her ability, she risked becoming consumed by it. She was not herself. She was the fire. A flame that wanted to burn brighter and hotter and to consume. If she wasn’t careful…
“Marianne,” he said, after shifting painfully back. She looked at him, but it was like she was looking through him. Her eyes burned bright, all yellow and orange and red. “Marianne, you’ve got to stop this. Stop this, now, before you kill yourself!”</Text>

            <Title>Scene 44</Title>
            <Text>Anthony was bored. Again. Dr. Allen had been called away; he had been an army surgeon, and he was required again. The doctor had arranged for him to sit in on the anatomy classes at the school, where his brother was lecturing.
His brother, the older Dr. Allen, was a competent lecturer, but he did not regularly have practical classes. And the longer he sat in class, the more he began to find that the older Dr. Allen tended to ramble on at length, never actually saying anything new. Anthony sat in class, paying little attention, scribbling. Anthony had discovered a love of engineering and mechanics, and had taken to sketching his ideas on paper while he listened to Dr. Allen’s lectures.
Occasionally, the anatomy school would arrange to have cadavers brought in, and Dr. Allen would perform dissections. These days were the worst, because the class size would swell and the students would crowd around the demonstration so that Anthony would be unable to see anything worthwhile. The dissections merely reminded him of what he was missing. Assisting with the doctor’s surgical procedures was much more satisfying; at least then there was the possibility of saving the life of the patient. With the dissections, there was only death.
Today though, Anthony would have welcomed a dissection. Instead, he was sitting through another boring lecture Anthony had heard a dozen times before. I could honestly teach this class myself, he thought.
He’d read all the books. He’d practiced dissections, and helped with hundreds of surgeries by now. He had more practical surgical experience already than many doctors would see in their lifetime. And now he’d sat in the lecture halls and heard all the lectures until they’d become tedious.
Quietly, Anthony got out of his seat. He was sitting in the back row, at the far left, so it was easy enough to pack up his books and slip out of the class without disrupting the professor, who was going on at length about the arguable merits of bloodletting.
He slipped out of the lecture hall. He unfolded his parasol as he stepped out into the promenade. The day was hot and sunny, rife with possibilities. Anthony was excited by his idea. He was walking quickly now, making his way through the streets he’d come to know so well. There was a little shop near the university, which catered to students of the university.
He had a little money in his pocket. His father hadn’t sent him to London to be poor. He fished the coins out of his pocket, and counted them as he walked. There was the shop. A sign in the window reassured him that it was open. He pushed the door open with a chime of jangling bells.
A man appeared behind the counter to greet him. He looked curiously at Anthony, frowning a little.
“Good day, sir,” he said, speaking as eloquently as possible so as to reassure the shopkeeper.
“How can I help you?” the man said gruffly.
“I am a medical student at the school of anatomy, and am apprenticed to a surgeon. I require my own equipment.”
The man sighed. “A bit young for an anatomy student, aren’t you?” he asked.
“I suppose so, sir,” Anthony admitted. He waited patiently. The man would either sell him the equipment, or he wouldn’t. There was no use attempting to argue with him.
“Alright then,” he said at last. The man made his way from behind the counter to where he kept the supplies for the medical students. “You need books?”
Anthony shook his head. “No, sir. I’ve got plenty of books.”
The shopkeeper nodded. He grabbed a few things off the shelf and loaded them into Anthony’s arms, listing the items and the prices respectively as he placed each tool into Anthony’s hand. Surgical bag. Scalpel. Forceps. Bone saw. When he was finished, Anthony’s hands were full, but his face was lit up with excitement. He brought his equipment to the counter, and the man called for his assistant to come and help him load the tools into the bag.
“Anything else I can help you with?” he asked.
Anthony did a quick mental calculation of the price of the tools. He counted his coins again, and determined that he had more than enough to pay for everything. “There is one more thing,” he said.
The man raised an eyebrow.
“I need an advertisement placed in the classifieds,” he said.
“Ah,” said the shopkeeper. Again, he called for his assistant, a boy about Anthony’s own age. “Write it down,” he said, “Jim here will see that it gets to the papers.”
Anthony smiled, delighted. This was all going surprisingly easily. “Thank you, sir,” he said. Then he picked up his pen, scrawled down the message.
Anthony Tidkins, Surgeon for Hire, he began.
He finished writing his message, and pushed it across the counter. He placed his coins down beside it, and the shopkeeper’s eyes lit up as bright as Anthony’s.
“Anything for my favourite customer,” he said.
Anthony grinned, and turned to follow Jim out of the store. He paused at the doorway. “You wouldn’t happen to know where I might buy a plague doctor’s mask, would you?”
The shopkeeper frowned. “What do you need that for?” he asked, all the good will gone from his voice. Anthony produced another coin from his pocket, let it roll between his fingers, and watched the shopkeeper’s eyes follow it as he returned it to his palm. He placed the coin on the counter.
“I know a leather-crafter,” said the shopkeeper. “It’s an unusual request, is all.”
Anthony had to agree. It was a bit unusual, but he felt that the mask was important if he was to be taken seriously. Dr. Allen’s patients hadn’t hesitated to hire the man in the mask. They’d wanted a doctor. They didn’t care that he wore an old-fashioned, creepy-looking mask. And they’d been desperate enough not to ask questions. But they might not have been so eager to hire a boy of thirteen, nor, for that matter, an albino.
In short, he felt that people would generally be more comfortable with a man with a mask than a boy without one.</Text>
            <Notes>- Establish Jack's mechanical tinkering earlier. Have him attend an operating theatre? Have him help with a dissection. Make Dr. Allen more like John Hunter: He should live in and run a medical school, have preparations in jars, be willing to experiment/question established practices/trust only his own eyes, dislike reading, army surgeon - called away for duty?</Notes>

            <Synopsis>Roderick fends the zombies off with Jonathan and Annabel’s help. He survives, but soon learns that Rémy is dead.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Roderick slammed into the door again, but still it held. His shoulder ached with his efforts, but the wood was beginning to splinter. It might have been boarded up from the inside. Still, another few kicks and it would swing open. Only there was no time. The zombies were at arm’s length. He raised his cane-sword. It was all he had to defend himself with now that his gun was empty.
At least it was better than the feeble letter opener he’d had earlier. He swung at the nearest of them. He sliced through the brittle skull of another, hacked off the jaw of a third. It came at him again, leering with its face sliced in two. There were too many of them. He tried to take a step back, but hit the wall of the building. There was nowhere to run, and no way he could fight them off.
A gunshot rang out in the small space of the alleyway. Roderick ducked and covered his head as another shot was fired. One of the zombies staggered and fell, a crossbow bolt through its skull. Out of the corner of his eye, Roderick could see two figures firing in his direction. If they missed, they’d hit Roderick. He wondered if they could even see him in the dark.
“Careful!” he called. “I’m not one of them!”
Bailey barked in agreement.
Apparently ignoring his instruction, the dark figure with the crossbow fired another shot. His aim was good, however, and another zombie hit the ground, bolt piercing through its eye. Shakily, Roderick got to his feet.
He could still count a dozen zombies, but he might actually stand a fighting chance now that he had help. Another gunshot rang out, followed by another crossbow bolt that went flying into one of the zombie’s throats. Syrupy, dark clots of blood oozed from the creature’s throat, but it still staggered forward, heedless of the bolt in its neck.
Roderick slammed the point of his sword into the creature’s eye, and drove it in deep. With a slurp of blade against brain and bone, he pulled the blade free and whirled it again.
The next zombie to come at him was a woman, her dress dirty and tattered. Her organs spilled out of her, wet and rotten. Her belly was swollen with pregnancy, but it had been ripped open, the umbilical cord hanging loose from the gaping hole in her stomach. Feeling sick with pity and disgust, Roderick staggered back, and took a moment to steel himself for what he had to do.
He looked into the woman’s eyes to remind himself that she was already dead. Then he ran his sword through her. She didn’t scream or cry out as she died. She simply fell silent and stopped moving. She hit the ground, mouth hanging open.
Roderick’s heart pounded. He gritted his teeth, wiped the sweat from his brow with his handkerchief, and deftly whirled his blade.
Finally, his freshly changed clothes soiled with gore, a pile of corpses surrounded him and his dog, and he sheathed his cane-sword. He took a moment to allow his nerves to steady.
“It’s alright, Bailey,” he said, though the dog was relatively calm.
It was Roderick that needed the assurance. He tried not to look at the sea of corpses that surrounded him. He tried not to think about the lives these men and women had once had, as he gingerly stepped over their mutilated and rotten bodies. The pregnant woman in particular left a lasting impression in his mind.
He raised his hand as he approached the shadowy figures in the alley. His saviors.
“Thank you,” he said.
As he drew nearer, dawn’s light steadily rising, fog clearing to reveal faces, he recognized Miss Monday as the crossbow wielder. The man with the gun was Jonathan.
Roderick smiled, relief turning to embarrassment. He let out a nervous laugh.
“Well, that was more of an adventure than we bargained for, eh Bailey?” he said. “I’m lucky to see you two.”
Jonathan said nothing, face grave, blood in his hair and on his hands. Miss Monday’s face and clothes were stained with blood. She wiped her face and panted for breath.
“We’d better get back,” she said, “God knows how many of these rotten things there are wandering about.”
“Right,” said Roderick, who followed as she turned on her heel and headed back in the other direction.
Jonathan halted him with a hand on his shoulder.
“What is it?” he asked.
He took another look at his friend’s face. His expression was not merely grave. There were tears in the corner of his eyes, pity written on his brow.
“What’s happened?” he asked.
That’s when he noticed that the blood on Jonathan’s face and hands was still wet and bright, unlike the blood of the zombies. It was fresh, and it wasn’t Jonathan’s own.
Roderick’s heart stopped. A hard lump formed in his throat. He tried to speak, and found that he couldn’t. His mouth was dry. The words froze on his lips.
“No,” he said, at last. His voice was a quiet whisper, raw with rage and pain. He wanted to scream, but the word came out silent, choked and broken, a silent sob.
“I’m sorry,” said Jonathan.
“Rémy?” he said, searching his friend’s face for some sign that he’d misunderstood, that it was someone—anyone else—who’d died. Palmer, or Lockwood, or even Miss Clementine. Roderick would have given anyone else’s life just to know that Rémy was still alive. He’d never told Rémy how much he loved him, how much he meant to him. He hadn’t even realized it himself, until now that he was gone.
“I’m sorry,” Jonathan said again, but Roderick couldn’t hear him over the sound of his own heart beating.
They followed Miss Monday back to Roderick’s house, but Roderick was barely aware of his surroundings, even as Monday cleared the path with her crossbow and Jonathan with his gun. He simply followed along blindly. He could have been eaten alive by the dead and he would hardly have felt it—all he could think about was Rémy. All he could see was his face. All he could feel—the last kiss they’d shared.
He was vaguely aware that they’d made it back to his place, of Lockwood and Kass and Palmer staring in dumbstruck horror as they realized that Rémy hadn’t made it back. In the edge of his vision, he saw Bailey whimpering and circling anxiously around his leg.
“They’re going to pay,” he said, finally, gritting his teeth. “They’re going to pay for this.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Synopsis>Finally, Annabel confronts Dr. Simms, who reveals that Jack was the bastard son of Dr. Allen and Mrs. Grimmer, while Jonathan was also born of an affair and is not truly Mrs. Grimmer’s son. Jack’s Dead London plan was concocted to save his dying father, and Mrs. Grimmer was complicit because Jack is her son and Dr. Allen was her lover. She hated Jonathan because he was not her son and reminded her of her husband’s unfaithfulness and the fact that she’d given up her own son while he’d not done the same.

Following this revelation, Annabel and Abraham run into Jack. Annabel puts a bullet in his skull, while the unliving begin to fill the halls of the underground.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Annabel turned to Abraham.
“Did you know?” she demanded.
“Know what?”
She holstered her pistol, but kept a firm grip on the scientist and kept the other boffins in her sight. Threat lingered in her eyes, and they kept their wary distance. These were doctors, not soldiers. Even if they were brainwashed, they seemed likely not to intervene so long as she retained the upper hand.
“That we would be too late,” she said to Abraham. “I knew not to trust that wretched woman.”
“Mrs. Grimmer?”
“She knew, didn’t she?” Annabel insisted. “She sent Steen, Hatton, and Oceleot to Trafalgar Square; Merrick, Ashcroft, and Lockwood to Hyde Park; and she went to Borough Market. Each of the sites where the Lazarus Virus was to be spread. But it was a wild goose chase, because she sent them there too late. And as for us, she led the pair of us straight into the den of snakes. She’s been with them all along, Mr. Palmer.”
Abraham shook his head.
“Nah,” he said. “Mrs. Grimmer’s still on your side.”
“You mean our side?”
Again, Abraham shook his head.
“Your side.”
He took a step back. Annabel reached for her gun, but it was missing from her holster. She looked down and found the gun, in Mr. Palmer’s hand.
“But you’re not brainwashed,” she said, dumbfounded. “Why would you…?”
“How do you know? Because my brain’s not scrambled like his? Memory loss isn’t even a side effect. Look, notice these red marks on his skin? Physical evidence is the only clear sign that someone’s under the influence of the serum.”
Annabel shook her head in disbelief. She'd made the stupid assumption of thinking that Simms' scrambled brain was a result of being brainwashed. And she'd trusted Grimmer because he didn't have that symptom, so she'd assumed he wasn't brainwashed. Stupid of her to make assumptions.
“So, are you?” she said.
He shrugged.
“I may be compromised, but not by any serum. I’m in it for the money and the immortality.”
“You’re incorrigible,” she said. “You saved my life, helped me get out of this place. You shot at your fellow Resurrectionists. You took a bullet for me!”
“Yes, well, that wasn’t the plan,” he admitted. “And I only saved you so I could get you out of the way. Turns out it worked quite nicely, if I may say so myself. Now that old Lazarus has been spread, there ain’t much use in pretending any more, is there?”
“So what happens now? Are you going to kill me?”
“Guess we’ll see what Mr. Tidkins wants to do with you. Maybe we’ll ship you off to Chateau D’If.”
He gestured with the gun, directing her to the hallway. He closed the door behind him, keeping his gun trained on her all the while. But even with the gun pointed at her, this might be her best chance to regain control of the situation.
She stepped towards him, sidestepping to anticipate his gunshot. As predicted, the gun went off, only narrowly missing her. She struck at his gun arm, and the weapon flew from his hand. She watched as it slid along the floor, well out of reach, and slammed her knee into Mr. Palmer’s gut. He doubled over, but she wasn’t finished with him yet. She followed up with an uppercut to his jaw, knocking a tooth loose.
He spat blood onto the floor and retaliated with a right hook, catching her off guard. He struck her cheek, and she staggered back. Even as she was struggling to regain her balance, he hit her again, this time square in the eye. He hit her again, each blow more brutal than the last. She fell to the floor.
She watched as he turned away from her, slowly, confidently making his way to the gun. She crawled to her feet.
“I’m not finished with you yet,” she told him.
He paused, turned around, and scoffed at her. Her lip was bloody, her eye was swollen. She looked like she could barely stand upright. He turned away, again going for the gun.
She attacked while his back was turned, kicking him in the soft spot behind the knee. He hit the ground hard with one knee, and Annabel kicked him again, this time in the back. He fell flat on his face. She grabbed the gun, relieved to feel it in her hand.
She stood up, aimed the gun at the back of Abraham’s skull, and cocked the pistol. But before she could pull the trigger, she heard a voice from behind her, muffled by a Resurrectionist’s mask but still recognisable. She kept her foot on Abraham’s back to keep him pinned to the floor, and looked over her shoulder. How he’d crept up on her so silently, she hadn’t the slightest idea, but she recognised him immediately. Her recognition did little to calm her.
His mask still strapped to his head, but pulled up to sit upon his forehead instead of his face, he stood before her. Anthony Tidkins. The Resurrection Man. Scientist, leader of a the Murder Club. To the city of London, he was a scourge. To Annabel, he was just Jack.
“Is it really too late?” she asked him.
“For London, or for us?”
He had taken off the mask, which he now held in one hand.
“For London,” she replied. Careful not to let her emotion show, she looked him in the eye and with careful inflection, she told him, “It is most definitely too late for us.”
He nodded.
“Fair enough.”
Perhaps she was mistaken, but she thought she detected a hint of regret in his pale red eyes, a note of sadness in his voice. Damn him, what did she care about his sadness, mass murderer that he was? She felt sick to think of what he had done.
“It is too late for London as well,” he added.
Her stomach clenched. She couldn’t understand why he’d done it. Jack had always had such endearing respect for life. Every life, precious, every single one. Even hers. That’s why he’d saved her all those years ago. Now he had destroyed a city of millions.
“Why, Jack?” she asked him.
“Because my father is dying,” he said simply.
It took her only a moment.
“Dr. Allen is your father?”
“I was his bastard son,” he explained. “He and my mother gave me up for adoption. My adoptive parents were unable to have children of their own. When my mother died, my father came to resent me, as if it was somehow my fault. He sent me to live with Dr. Allen. He said it was because Dr. Allen was a renowned surgeon, and he wanted me to be trained by him, but we both knew that was a lie. I believed it was because he didn’t want me any more. It was only later, much later, that I learned the real reason I’d been sent to Dr. Allen. Yes, he is my real father.”
“And you think this will save him?” Annabel asked.
She returned her attention to Mr. Palmer, who was trying to get up. She kicked him in the back, and he grunted in pain. She looked again at Jack.
Her hand was trembling, her vision unclear. She steeled herself. Before she could put further thought into it, she raised the pistol. Point blank, she aimed its muzzle at her oldest friend and put her finger on the trigger.</Text>
            <Notes> His eyes widened, and without another word, without another thought, she put a bullet in his skull.
She gasped with relief and regret and anguish as his blood spattered across her cheek, hot and wet. It seemed to sting as it struck her skin.
Abraham gasped in surprise, but Annabel’s attention was focused on Jack’s body. His eyes and mouth wide with surprise, a gaping hole through his left cheek, his body lay still on the floor.
Annabel’s knees threatened to buckle, and tears formed in her eye, but she kept herself upright. Finally, she returned her attention to Mr. Palmer.
“Let me up,” he was saying, as Annabel recovered her nerves and steadied herself. “You’ve got to let me up.”
He was gesturing towards something off in the distance. She blinked the tears from her eyes and looked. The zombies were staggering down the hall towards them.</Notes>

            <Title>Scene 49</Title>
            <Synopsis>Annabel escapes her cell. She runs into Jack.</Synopsis>
            <Text>“Someone’s coming,” Parson Sinews hissed.
Annabel followed his gaze. She couldn’t see anyone, even with her enhanced vision, but she decided to trust him. Without a word, she collapsed on the floor, where she lay motionless. A moment later, someone rounded the corner. An unfamiliar voice, two sets of footsteps.
“This is the prisoner?”
“That’s her.” The second voice belonged to Dr. Jekyll.
“Good, she’s still unconscious. Should be easy enough to get a sample.”
Annabel heard the sound of a key being pushed into a lock, a sound with which she was intimately familiar. The lock clicked, and the door opened.
“Be careful,” said Dr. Jekyll. “She may not be unconscious; she may be dead. Which means she could wake up at any moment, infected with Lazarus.”
Annabel kept her eyes shut, and just listened as the footsteps crossed the room. She felt the man leaning over her, endured his hands on her side as he reached down and pricked her neck with the needle of the syringe. She waited a moment while he extracted her blood.
When he pulled the needle out, she attacked, startling him with a head-butt, breaking his nose. She put a hand to her mechanical eye, and the dart shot out. Only a moment later, he slumped forward, dropping the blood-filled syringe to the floor.
She squirmed her way out from beneath his unconscious body, picked up the syringe, and scurried out of her cell, going straight for Dr. Jekyll. The man yelped and turned to flee, but Annabel was much quicker. She seized him by the throat and thrust the syringe into his neck. Suddenly he became very still.
“So, you want my blood, do you?”
“No,” he whimpered. “No, please no. You could be infected.”
“Explain.”
“At Lord Connor’s masquerade, you were probably exposed to the Lazarus Virus. Of course, there was no way of knowing for certain you’d been infected. But the needle I used to knock you out, it was contaminated.”
She pressed the needle harder into his neck. “Why?” she demanded.
“You know why,” he said, his voice trembling, “You might be immune.”
“But odds are, I’m not, right?” she replied, somehow managing to remain calm. “So, my blood is infected with the Lazarus Virus? In that case, if you know what’s good for you, you’ll tell me what I want to know.”
From his cell, Parson Sinews quietly applauded.
“Bravo, Miss Monday.” he said. “I find I am enjoying myself after all.”
Annabel shared a look with him. Perhaps he was not so unlikeable as she’d first thought.
“Behind you!”
She was already on it. Without turning away or letting go of the scientist’s neck, she pivoted, raised her arm, and took hold of a man’s wrist. She bent her knees and using his momentum against him, flipped the man over her back. He was surprisingly heavy. The only thing that allowed her to manage the feat was his own momentum. She sent him sprawling, grunting with the effort as her corset dug into her chest and her skirt suffered an indecorous tear.
She heard him hit the ground hard, the wind knocked out of him, and turned to look at him. He was a giant, nearly eight feet tall by Annabel’s estimation. Tall, broad-shouldered, but slow-moving. He began struggling to get up, but he was having difficulty. She might have broken one of his bones.
Turning back to the doctor, she saw that she had emptied the syringe. She must have done it while busy dealing with the giant.
“Oops,” said Annabel, smiling wickedly.
“What?” said Dr. Jekyll, turning pale. “What is it?”
Sinews began to laugh. Either he’d guessed or he’d seen what had happened. He covered his mouth with his hand in an effort to disguise his joy.
“Splendid,” he cried.
“What?” Dr. Jekyll said again.
“It seems I’ve given you an injection of my own blood, doctor. An excellent research opportunity, I have no doubt.”
It was true. In the moment she’d been distracted by the giant, she had accidentally emptied the syringe into the surgeon’s neck. She showed him the empty syringe, with an apologetic shrug.
The doctor became hysterical.
“You bitch!” he fumed, repeating it again at a greater volume, jerking wildly in her grasp in a vain attempt to hit her. He was going to rouse the entire compound with his fit of verbigeration. She did the only thing she could think of.
She hit him. Hard.
He collapsed to the floor, unconscious. Meanwhile, the giant had managed to get to his feet. His height was even more impressive when he was standing upright. His head practically scraped the ceiling. Like so many of his comrades, he wore the black, leather plague mask. On him, it was even more intimidating. It reminded her of the enormous skull of a prehistoric beast in a museum.
She raised her fists and prepared for the fight. He towered over her, his enormous arms thick as tree trunks and as long as an ape’s.
He moved slowly, grasping at her head with his giant mitts. She ducked to evade him, but underestimated his reach. He seized her by the head with one hand and squeezed. She felt like her head was going to explode.
Gasping in pain, she tried to hit him, but he simply stretched out his arms, so she couldn’t reach him. She might have tried kicking him, but with her corset, she lacked the range of motion.
She blinked the pain away, grabbed him by the wrist, and twisted. The trick was to use his weight against him. All she needed was leverage, and -
He cried out in pain, twisting as she bent his arm. Annabel had been in fights before; she hadn’t survived a life on the street by being meek. While he was off balance, she kicked him, aiming for his shins. He howled with pain as her boot connected with his leg.
She jabbed with her left hand, striking him in the gut. His stomach felt like it was chiseled out of rock. Annabel tried to shake away the pain in her hand, bouncing on her feet like a boxer.
The giant growled and swung his fist. Annabel ducked under his arm, close enough to feel the swish of air ripple past her. She exploded upward with a right-handed uppercut, connecting with the giant’s chin. The blow sent him sprawling.
He spat blood onto the floor, and got to his feet.
“Quite the punch,” he said, reaching up beneath his mask to retrieve a tooth that had been dislodged. He flicked it away, bloody and large. It hit the floor with a sound like dice being rolled.
Annabel sized up her opponent and took a moment to crack the knuckles in her hand and flex the muscles in her shoulder. She raised both hands to protect her head and danced around the giant as he aimed a few clumsy punches at her. She managed to land another right-hand punch, causing him to stumble backwards. Seizing her advantage, she followed up with the left, then another right.
But she’d overplayed her hand. Regaining his balance more quickly than she’d expected, he managed to dodge her incoming fist. He countered with a sharp left hook of his own. Vision blurred. Blood, and maybe a broken jaw. Annabel stumbled. Taking another blow to the skull, she was left reeling, deaf to her own cries of pain. The next blow to her chest sent her flying.
A low gasp escaped her lips as she hit the floor and crashed into the wall. The ceiling danced before her. Gingerly putting a hand to her chin, Annabel winced in pain. There was blood, but her jaw wasn’t broken like she’d feared. Her head ached, and her vision swam.
She was vaguely aware of Parson Sinews telling her to get up, but his voice sounded a million miles away.
She shook her head and got to her knees. It was hard to move in this god-awful corset, but Sinews was right. She needed to get up. She managed to struggle to her feet and quickly adjusted the lens of her mechanical eye, anticipating the giant coming over to finish her off.
Instead, the giant had turned away and was hobbling down the hallway, away from her.
“Come back and face me!” she shouted, but he ignored her. No doubt he intended to sound the alarm.
Annabel took off after him, half running half stumbling, bracing against the wall for support.
She had nearly caught him when he darted through a doorway. The door slammed. She tried for the handle, but he had locked it already. Mere moments passed before the alarm began to sound, a horridly loud siren sound that resonated throughout the compound.
She doubled back. She needed to get back to the elevator, but she hadn’t crossed this part of the compound on her way in.
“How do I get out of here?” she hissed at Mr. Sinews when she arrived back at his cell.
“I’ll get you out,” he said, “But first you’ll need to get me out.”
She nodded quickly. There was little time to argue with him. She’d spent her last dart, was unarmed, and who knew how many worked in this facility and what sort of security they had? She stepped back into her own cell, reached for the keys the unconscious scientist had dropped, and found them a moment later. A surprisingly difficult task, given the wardrobe requirements of her sex, but she managed it quickly enough.
She tried the keys in Mr. Sinews’ cell door. The first one failed to open it. She tried the next. When it too failed, she slid it along the key ring and tried the next one in line. Again, the lock refused to open. She spared a glance down the hallway. Still vacant, but surely she didn’t have much time. The alarm was unbearably loud. It had to be a matter of seconds before they converged upon her.
The lock refused to turn. One key after another until her attempts became more clumsy as she frantically eliminated each one.
“Try the next one,” Mr. Sinews urged.
She did so, and the key failed. Last one; if this one failed, she would have to make a choice. Either leave him here and navigate the complex alone and badly outnumbered, or attempt to pick the lock without her proper tools and risk being caught. 
She slid the key into the lock and without hesitation, turned it. The lock didn’t budge. She banged against the cell door in frustration.
“It’s no use,” she told him, “I’ve tried them all. I’m sorry.”
Mr. Sinews’ face became cold with rage, though Annabel could see that it was not directed at her. The swagger he seemed to possess, the nonchalance and sardonic smile melted into a sneer.
“Do me one last favor then,” he said, locking eyes with her and forcing a smile.
His eyes. They were that bright shade of green that seemed, well, inhuman for lack of a better word. A vibrant absinthe green. There’s no time for this, she thought dully, but she found herself nodding.
“Yes,” she said dreamily.
“Draw back your sleeve,” he said.
It was strange. She wasn’t even sure his mouth had moved. His voice just seemed to be inside her head. Ordinarily she would have gasped at the scandalous request, but now she complied, drawing back the fabric of her left sleeve to reveal bare skin. She found that she was trembling. The wailing of the siren was drowned out by the palpitations of her heart.
He reached a hand through the bars of his cell door, took hold of her wrist, causing her to flush. One of his fingernails was long and sharpened to a point. He used it to prick two tiny pinholes in her wrist. A bead of blood formed at each tiny wound. He drew her arm inside his cell, bent his lips over her wrist, and began to suck the blood from her wounds.
She gasped, but it not because it was painful. It was startlingly pleasurable, even when he drew hard on her wrist and sucked back mouthfuls of her blood. She felt her knees becoming weak as he drank, and though she was scandalized, she found that she was incapable of objecting. If he wanted to take her, just now, she would have let him. If he’d wanted to kill her, she’d have given him the bullets and the gun to do the deed.
Mr. Sinews was even more dangerous than she’d given him credit for, even behind bars.
“You’re not one of them, are you?” she said. “A zombie, I mean.”
He shook his head and licked the blood from his lips.
“I am something else,” he said darkly.
“Then you really are a vampire,” she whispered, still a bit delirious.
She stifled a giggle. Who would have thought her blood would be in such high demand?
“Just because I drink blood and daylight burns my skin doesn’t mean I’m a vampire.”
His mouth was still smeared with blood, and the smile was back on his face. He appeared flushed, and there was something different about his eyes. They were still green, but now they seemed more natural. More human.
“What are you?” she asked, sobriety gradually returning to her.
His answer was a whisper in the air, evanescent and ephemeral as fog, and she found herself beginning to forget it even as the words slipped from his tongue. “I am fey,” he said.
Fey, she thought, as in fairie. Even as an orphan, Annabel had heard faerie tales growing up. There was a great deal of superstition in Annabel’s social class. Urchins, orphans, the poor and criminal class, the immigrants, they tended to believe in faerie stories. But theirs were not the same as the fairy tales of spoiled rich children. The faerie tales Annabel had always heard were of dangerous creatures, inhuman and dangerous. The faeries that stole children from their beds, replacing them with monstrous changelings. The faeries that led travelers astray, drowned them in bogs, or snacked on their bones.
There was a fleeting moment where Annabel almost laughed, but it was gone in an instant. When she looked into his eyes, she knew he wasn’t joking. And she knew that if he really was a faerie, he was the kind Annabel could believe in.
She had a question, on the edge of her memory, and a strange sense that she was between two worlds right now—the world of Parson Sinews, and the other world. There was a siren going off, a loud ululating tone that somehow seemed to be coming from far away.
She forced herself to listen to it, to hear the alarm. There was something that she needed to do, something she desperately needed to do, if only she could remember what it was. Run. There it was—the simple, three-letter word she’d been searching for—and suddenly, she could no longer remember why she was standing there, staring into Parson Sinews’ green eyes. She needed to get out of here. The deafening alarm was ringing throughout the hallway.
She tore herself away from Sinews’ intoxicating eyes, only to face another danger. She was surrounded by Resurrectionists.
There were six of them on each side of the hallway, a dozen in all, their guns fixed on her. They were dressed in the crow-faced plague doctor masks. Among them stood the giant, towering above the rest.
But it was the man beside him, who held Annabel’s attention. He stepped forward, holding off the others with a casual gesture. Even the giant stepped aside to make way for him. It was clear that he was a leader among these Resurrectionists. His mask, distinct from the others only in that it was weathered and had obviously been well-worn, was familiar to Annabel. She’d seen it at Lord Connor’s masquerade, and should have recognised it then. A part of her had, but she’d denied it, because she knew what it meant.
“Hello Annabel,” he said, his voice muffled but nonetheless familiar.
His voice, too, had been familiar when she’d heard it at the masquerade. Even though it was muffled, she should have known. But it had been so long since she’d heard it, and she hadn’t expected to ever see him again. Still, a part of her had known his voice then, too.
She’d known it when she saw Bertram Melbourne’s mutilated body. She’d known it when she first began seeing the reports in the newspapers. She wanted to unclasp the leather straps on her head and tear her eye from its socket. He had given her this eye. Wearing it now, she felt like an accomplice to his deeds. Like she was condoning what he’d done. More than that, she owed him for her vision. She didn’t want to owe him anything. She wanted to rip her eye from her face, to crush the damned thing beneath the heel of her boot. But she couldn’t.
“Hello, Jack,” she said, her voice a razor-sharp blade she hoped would cut him, all sharp edges and cold steel. “Forgive me. You go by Anthony Tidkins these days, don’t you?”</Text>
            <Comments>Did this actually happen or are Annabel and Sinews messing with the doctor?  I would indicate this.
Taking another blow to the skull, she was left reeling, deaf to her own cries of pain. The next blow to her chest sent her flying.
Lying flat on her back, the ceiling danced before her. Gingerly putting a hand to her chin, she winced in pain. There was blood but her jaw was intact/wasn't broken. Her head ached and her vision swam/blurred.

A of these sentences begin with she, it was hard to read. Try using present particples or omitting the subject:</Comments>

            <Title>Scene 68</Title>
            <Text>Cloaked in olfactory camouflage—the stench of putrescence smeared on his clothes in streaking lines of gore and blood—a pale man walked with a slow gait, paused to unfurl his umbrella before stepping out into the rain and fog. He was ignored by the dead, who confused him for one of their own, thanks to his death-like stench and slow pace.
The dim light of a few street lamps pierced the blinding fog, cutting through the grey skies with orbs of yellow that melted into the mist.
He ambled slowly through London’s bleak streets with purpose, passing through neighborhoods a gentleman of his prestige ought to have avoided even if the city wasn’t ridden with zombies. Eventually he reached Whitechapel, which had yet to be touched by the Lazarus Virus. Here, only the danger came from the living, but this danger was not one to be overlooked.
The coarse voices of beggars called to him as he passed, drunken cries suffocated by liquor. Whispered words from toothless prostitutes, muffled by the patter of rain upon cobblestone, hardly managed to arouse his curiosity. He was here on business.
He continued on his way through Whitechapel, not speaking a word to anybody, though he paused to lower his umbrella and to feel the rain pouring down upon his neck.
Jack The Ripper once worked here, he thought. On these very streets, picking out women whose guts he wanted to see from the outside, and whose blood he wanted to spill. He thought about what that must be like, not from the whore’s point of view, but from the Ripper’s.
Turning one’s thoughts to the contemplation of murder was a certain way to ease the boredom. Was that why Jack had done it? To feel his own pulse quicken as he felt their hot blood upon his face, stifled their screams with a gloved hand upon their soft lips.
There was fear in taking a person’s life. Fear of being caught, fear of being damned to hell, fear that one’s prey might not get away.
Guilt. There was guilt, too. Then again, he wasn’t so sure. For him, there was no guilt, but whenever he had killed, it was with purpose. The Dead London Project. Jack the Ripper was different. He killed wantonly, without purpose or reason. Still, perhaps the Ripper had felt no guilt. Perhaps the thrill of murder had overcome those scant feelings of meaningless remorse. Perhaps knowing that he could slit a woman’s throat and pluck out her insides as easily as slitting open the wax seal of a letter, made the Ripper feel so powerful as to render his victims’ lives meaningless in his eyes.
He must have felt like a god. A god of death and destruction, a killing angel. The whores—ants to be crushed beneath his feet.
It didn’t feel like so long ago that he had taken his first life, not so long since he began to fear he would not be able to go through with it. The Dead London Project was too important to him to fail on account of something so ridiculous as his overdeveloped sense of the importance of human life. After all, that was the point of it all, anyway. To conquer life.
To see his life’s work come to fruition, he needed to be like Jack the Ripper—powerful, able to claim lives without a single moment of regret, to feel their hot blood upon his cheeks. He needed to be like Varney the Vampire, Sweeney Todd, or Anthony Tidkins, the very embodiment of fear, an emblem of death. A villain from a Penny Dreadful.
Only then could he transcend who he really was. Pathetic. Weak. Frail. Emotional. He, who believed that nothing, not love, not art, not money, not even science, could possibly outweigh the worth of a single human life. He remembered the fear he’d felt. The doubt. Could he really take someone’s life?
And if he did, would it thrill him? Would it quicken his pulse with fear and guilt and revulsion? Or would he hesitate? Would he pause to reflect at the immorality of his actions, halt and consider the villainy of even thinking such damnable thoughts—the murder of innocents, the slaughter of thousands.
He felt his trousers tighten, felt the blood in his veins seem to quicken, felt his eyes light up with a fervor that made the darkness of the cloudy night seem strangely bright, and he remembered the very moment he’d known the answer to that question.
No, he hadn’t hesitated. No, he hadn’t paused to reflect. No, he hadn’t felt the slightest flicker of guilt.
Yes, he had been thrilled. Yes, his pulse had quickened. Yes, he’d felt more alive than he ever had in all his years.
Aroused by that memory, he let his umbrella clatter upon the ground. He stripped off his jacket and his vest, and threw them upon the street. He peeled off his shirt as if overcome by fever. Feeling manic, he let the rain beat down upon his bare chest. He stared into the sky and watched the rain beat down upon the lenses of his mask.
“‘ello mister,” said a voice, drawing his attention away from the heavens.
A woman, delicate and soft-featured, though she was dirty and dressed in cheap and tattered cloth, raised her hand to her forehead to shield her eyes against the rain, and looked at him in surprise.
Her blue, flower-print dress was drenched in rain, her hair soaked, and she was evidently intoxicated, as she staggered in his direction.
“See somefin’ ye like?” she called, raising her dress up to reveal a set of long legs. She named a price, and when he said nothing, lowered the price without a moment’s consideration. When he still made no reply, she raised her dress still further, giving him a flash of the goods.
Finally, she cursed at him and turned to leave.
Suddenly, she recoiled, as she caught a glimpse of his masked face through the roiling cloud of fog. She caught a flash of ivory-white skin beneath his mask, and through the foggy lenses of the mask, soft pink eyes.
He moved slowly toward her as she staggered back, reaching into a small bag that he kept in his left hand, and withdrawing a small vial of green liquid. He reached into the bag again, and slotted the green vial into the back of a mechanical raven.
He smiled beneath his mask, as the young woman watched him approach through the fog, surprise giving way to fear. 
Yes, he thought, at once thrilled and disturbed by the look on her pretty, young face. Yes, I do see something I like.
He tipped his hat and smiled, though she could not have seen his cheshire grin, as it was hidden by the bird-like leather mask of a plague doctor.
“Do you know who I am?” he asked, replacing the hat upon his head and taking the clockwork bird out of his bag. His voice sounded strange and muffled through the leather mask, low and inhuman.
She shook her head and began to move away from him, backing up until she stumbled into a wall and lost her balance. She fell, mud and rain splashing upon her dress and legs. She kicked out and began to scramble, backward, away from him. Her shoe slipped off, but she hardly seemed to notice.
He wound the clockwork bird, and let it go. It took flight and wheeled overhead, hissing as it released the infectious gas.
The sound of the woman choking, gasping for air. Her face turning blue. Her body twitching in the gutter. It delighted the Resurrectionist.
“I am Anthony Tidkins,” he said, “The Resurrection Man.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene 17</Title>
            <Synopsis>Roderick Steen begins to investigate the murder of Lord Connor. </Synopsis>
            <Text>Detective Taggert guided Roderick through Lord Connor’s house. Roderick took in the scene without saying much, simply observing the state of the bodies, trying to put names to some of the faces. Roderick was good with names, and read all the society papers. He recognized a good number of the faces, having once seen their engravings in print.
“And Lord Connor? Where is he?”
Taggert looked at him in mild surprise. He looked around, as if he might suddenly discover the man’s body among the others. It seemed that Taggert hadn’t even thought to look for the man of the house. To be fair, the detective did have a lot on his plate.
“This was his party. He must be here somewhere,” said Roderick. “Have you been through Connor’s private apartments yet?”
Taggert admitted that he hadn’t, and gestured for a party of officers to join him. With Roderick trailing behind them, they marched upstairs. They found the gate to Connor’s private quarters unlocked and opened. They headed through it, each of the policemen opening doors along the side and peering in. Each of the rooms upstairs proved empty, with no sign that anyone had been there, until they reached Connor’s study.
The policemen shared a look of alarm from the very moment they approached the door. It appeared to have been kicked in. The policemen entered the room first.
Detective Taggert held the door open for Roderick to enter. Roderick had a certain way of entering a room. The bare feet and foppish attire tended to draw attention, but it was really his ego that drew attention. He was, after all, a famous artist, and carried himself accordingly. He couldn’t help but be dramatic.
His eyes swept the room, taking in every detail; even the movement of his eyes was a performance. He stripped off his gloves, fished into his pockets and retrieved a piece of soft candy. He shoved the toffee into his mouth and chewed thoughtfully. The officers looked at him in bewilderment; not all of the police were accustomed to Roderick’s eccentricities.
He handed the candy wrapper to a nearby policeman, who seemed at a loss as to what to do with it. He turned to Connor’s desk, perused the stack of papers atop it, pulled open the drawers, slammed them shut.
Of Connor’s body, there was no sign. So far, the intelligence Jonathan had provided had been outdated, which meant that quite a lot had happened here after Jonathan’s timely departure. Connor’s body, of course, had been in this room when Jonathan left it. It should have been there still. But Roderick couldn’t admit this knowledge to the police without giving away the fact that his friend had been here. He had to come up with the knowledge on his own.
It was a bit like being asked to show one’s work for a math problem after solving the equation in one’s head. It was also the opposite of the way Roderick usually worked; he had to work backwards, knowing that Connor’s body had been moved, and appear to come to the same conclusion based on the evidence around him. Unfortunately, the evidence was slim. Best to simply throw himself into it with all that he had, he decided.
“Connor died in this room,” he proclaimed. “His body must have been moved, probably by the Resurrectionists, perhaps by the Resurrection Man himself.”
Roderick chuckled nervously once he realized that all eyes were suddenly on him.
Drawing him aside, Taggert said under his breath, “Don’t you think you’re leaping to conclusions? We don’t have a body. There’s no way you could know that Connor died here, let alone that he was even in the room during the party.”
“Perhaps you’re right,” Roderick said loudly, for the benefit of the other policemen. Roderick was not to be deterred, and he worked better under pressure. “In the absence of a body, I shall defer to the other clues.”
“Which are, what precisely?” asked one of the policemen.
Roderick let out an exaggerated sigh.
“Is yours a practiced stupidity, or does it come naturally to you?” he asked. “Very well then. The clues. First, there is the handle of the door, which as I’m sure you noticed, had a crimson stain on the handle. On its own, this might be considered quite innocuous; it could be wine or paint, but given that a massacre occurred in this house this very evening, it does seem a bit ominous, doesn’t it?”
The policemen, Taggert included, shifted their focus to the bloodstained door. They took in the splintered wood and the loose hinges.
“There is also the fact that the door has been kicked in—you can’t have failed to notice that. Either the killer broke in to Connor’s study, or the killer himself was intruded upon while finishing up his work. This seems most likely, as the killer went out the window.”
The police officers turn to the window, then back to Roderick for an explanation: there seemed little to indicate that someone had gone out the window. Roderick glanced at the window, wondering if he’d just put his foot in his mouth. After all, he hadn’t actually found a clue to back up his version of events. He knew someone had gone out the window, because Jonathan had told him so. He went to the window, and looking it over, improvised.
“The window was opened in a hurry, as any schoolboy could surely tell you. Note the deep grooves in the wood, here. Also consider that it is very chilly this evening. Why would Lord Connor have been working in his study with the window open on such a cold evening?”
The police gaped at Roderick in stupefied silence, their mouths opening and shutting like goldfish.
“Sometimes it is the most innocuous clues that are most telling,” he said to divert them from how very silly his so-called evidence was. Before they had a chance to consider, he soldiered on.
“Next, there is the bullet hole in the ceiling,” Roderick said. Perhaps he should have begun with that one and left out the bit about the window entirely. The policemen, for their part, seemed very impressed by the bullet hole. He decided, therefore, to focus on that detail. “If Connor’s guests were murdered with poisonous gas, then why is there a bullet hole in the carpet, and why is his body not among the others? It stands to reason that Connor was not killed in the same manner as his guests.”
Taggert was twirling his moustache, a habit that Roderick was having difficulty ignoring. Roderick turned away in order to regain his concentration. He wasn’t sure what to make of this evidence, but just talking about the clues aloud had gotten his brain into gear.
“Why were Connor’s guests murdered?” he asked rhetorically, thinking aloud. “Was it an attack on the upper class? Or was there a single target, the rest merely collateral damage? Is it possible that the masqueraders were murdered only to cover up another murder?”
Taggert said nothing, but he seemed to be following along well enough. He was nodding thoughtfully, even though Roderick was talking at a dizzying pace.
“There is also the fact that the desk has been moved,” Roderick went on. “Note the indentation on the carpet, left by the legs of the desk. We can easily deduce that the desk was moved, likely during a struggle, either between Connor and his killer, or between the killer and whoever broke down the door. Later, the desk was moved back, but it sat there long enough to indent the carpet. The fact that it was moved back seems to suggest that somebody went to some amount of trouble to cover up the evidence. The Resurrection Man has never covered up evidence before, so we can deduce that he did not work alone.”
Roderick paused to reflect on this. It was a revelation to him as well. Sometimes he seemed to speak more quickly than he could think, and occasionally, he managed to surprise even himself with his deductions.
“Here, the carpet is damp. You might not have noticed it, which I suppose can be forgiven, as you’re all quite strangely wearing shoes,” he said, regarding their footwear with suspicion. “But I assure you, it is quite damp; somebody did a rather remarkable job of washing the blood out of the carpet, but it has not yet completely dried, and it still smells musty, stale, but with a trace of iron. It might not be blood, but what else has that telltale metallic scent? Of course, perhaps the most revealing clue is that Connor’s safe has been robbed.”
For a moment, nobody spoke. The policemen looked about the room, dumb expressions on their faces. One of the officers stooped over and touched the carpet. He put his nose close to it and sniffed. He nodded, confirming that the carpet was damp and had the blood-like smell of iron.
“His safe?” asked an officer with a distinctive and thoroughly waxed mustache.
“Yes,” said Mr. Steen, “You failed to notice that as well.”
It wasn’t a question. The policemen looked about the room, all of them refusing to meet Mr. Steen’s eyes. Silence reigned. Finally, Roderick pointed it out.
“That’s a tea trolley,” Mr. Taggert protested.
“Oh, really? In that case, assam.”
Taggert snorted. He marched across the room to the trolley. Which is when he realized that it wasn’t a tea trolley at all. Beneath the cart, a locked box had been worked into the design of the furniture. The door was cracked open.
“Eat your words, Mr. Taggert,” said Roderick. A triumphant grin curled up on his face, enjoying the detective’s reaction.
“Gloating does not become you, Mr. Steen,” Taggert said flatly.
Roderick puffed up his chest. It was true, besting Taggert in a battle of wits was a bit like beating an infant at chess, but Roderick was nothing if not fickle.
Taggert stooped over and pulled the door open. Within the box, a large, steel safe was concealed. Its door too, was cracked open. He swung the door the rest of the way open and peered inside. Empty.
“I don’t suppose you know what was in the safe?” asked Mr. Taggert.
“How would I possibly know that?” asked Mr. Steen, incredulous. “I’m not a psychic.”
“Please,” said Taggert. “Focus, Mr. Steen. I believe we’re just beginning to form a picture of what happened here. Just tell us what you think happened here.”
“Very well,” said Roderick. He broke off as an awful sound cut through the silence of the household. The sound of screaming.
Roderick looked down at the floor, then exchanged a look with the detective. The sound was coming from downstairs. The screams continued, and were joined by the sound of a loud bang and the shattering of glass, as if a very heavy piece of furniture had been knocked over.
They heard footsteps pounding up the staircase. Taggert went to the door, as somebody called out his name. A young officer appeared in the hallway, clutching his neck as if wounded. Taggert stepped aside to let him into Connor’s study.
“The dead,” he stammered, “The dead…”
“Spit it out, boy,” Taggert commanded. “What’s going on down there?”
The injured officer looked up at the detective, his face pale.
“The dead are waking up.”
With that, he collapsed. As soon as he let go of his wounded neck, a thick puddle of blood spilled onto the floor.
Roderick stepped back, not wanting to get blood on his feet. He stared at the young man in alarm. The back of the young man’s neck had been ripped open and there were what looked like tooth marks in his flesh.</Text>
            <Comments>Seems a bit off for a guy who looks so polished.  Is he doing this on purpose, or is this simply a bad habit?
Contaminating a crime scene!
Note: previously “letting it fall to the floor
How did the bullet strike the floor, if Conner was on top of Mr. 
Monday, and he (she) shot into his mouth, which exited the top of his 
head?  Wouldn't that put the bullet into the ceiling?

Copper?  Blood smells of Iron, which the hemoglobin is based on 
(maybe?).  Or, was a Copper based cleaner used to clean the blood?

I can just image the smirk that is curling up on his face as he says these words.  Maybe make a note of that so your readers can see that too, unless you prefer to keep him emotionless.  Paint the picture how you see it!
If the young officer was bitten on the back of his neck so roughly to the point that tissue was removed (assuming that he is not the only one) Did they not hear screaming as the dead woke and attacked people?</Comments>

            <Text>Roderick slammed into the door again, but still it held. His shoulder ached with his efforts, but the wood was beginning to splinter. Another few kicks and it might swing open, but there was no time. The undead men were at arm’s length. He raised his fists. They were all he had to defend himself with.
A gunshot rang out in the small space of the alleyway. Roderick ducked and covered his head as another shot was fired. One of the undead staggered and fell. Out of the corner of his eye, Roderick could see a policeman firing in his direction. If he missed, he’d hit Roderick. He wondered if the man could even see him, in the dark.
“Careful!” he called.
Bailey barked in agreement.
Apparently ignoring his instruction, the policeman fired another shot. His aim was good, however, and the second undead man hit the ground. Shakily, Roderick got to his feet.
“It’s alright, Bailey,” he said, though the dog was hardly the one in hysterics.
He raised his hands as he approached the policeman.
“Sir, I am relieved to find you here.”
“Are you hurt?” asked the officer, stepping further into the alley. As he got closer, his face became distinct.
“Taggert!” Roderick exclaimed.
“Steen? What are you doing here?”
“Just taking an early morning stroll, sir,” he said, dusting off his clothes. “And you?”
“Trying to round up the dead. Or the infected. Whatever they are. This infection, it spread fast. We’d been tracking down the ones that got away from Lord Connor’s, but each time we found one of them, there’d be a trail of blood and several more of them. Who knows how many of these things there are by now? We could have ourselves an epidemic.”
Roderick merely raised an eyebrow.
“So you haven’t gotten any sleep either?”
“There’s something else you need to see, too. Just got the telegram, so I haven’t been there yet, myself, but I wanted to catch these last two.”
“These are the last two?” Roderick asked.
“Let’s hope so,” Taggert replied. “I doubt it. Anyway, there’s been another murder. Looks like Dr. Allen. You up for it, Steen? You seem shaken.”
Roderick stifled a yawn, and tried not to look at the dead bodies lying in the alley.
“I’m fine,” he said. “Mind if I bring Bailey?”
Taggert shrugged.
“Did you hear that, Old Bailey? We’re going to another murder site! Isn’t this exciting?”
The dog yipped in appreciation, and Roderick gestured for the chief inspector to lead the way. They left the bodies in the alley. Taggert would probably have someone double back to pick up the cadavers, but there was little time to worry about them now.
They climbed into a carriage, and Taggert gave the driver an address. Bailey scampered onto Roderick’s lap, and Roderick shut the door. With a crack of the driver’s whip, they were on their way.
As they drove, Taggert handed Roderick a scrap of paper, which Roderick unfolded.
“Your list,” Taggert explained. “Everyone that attended Connor’s ball.”
Roderick stared at Taggert, scrutinized his face as if for some sign that something was wrong.
“You’re unusually efficient,” he pronounced. “What about my interview with the witness? Miss Karnstein?”
“There, I must disappoint you, Mr. Steen. We’ve been unable to locate Miss Karnstein. I’m sure we’ll manage to find her in due time, but we’ve been a bit preoccupied, I must admit.”
“There, that’s more like you,” Roderick replied. “I’d hate for you to become entirely competent, or you’d have little need of me. By the way, I’ve been doing some thinking…”
“And?”
Roderick had broken off. He was staring at the list of names Taggert had provided. His eyes brightened. He began to bob in his seat, failing to contain his excitment.
“This is brilliant,” he said, showing Taggert the list of names, gesturing meaningfully with the sheet of paper. “Have you read this?”
There had been hundreds of guests at the party, some nine hundred names. But at least some of the names were significant, at least by Roderick’s estimation. He pointed at each one, reading the names aloud.
“Lord Ruthven. Lord Wagner. Sweeney Todd. Jack Harkaway. Richard Turpin.”
“Those can’t possibly be real names,” Taggert said, frowning.
“Indeed. Perhaps you’ve read some of the stories in which they’ve appeared. Figures from penny dreadfuls, Mr. Taggert. I believe you know what that means.”
“Resurrectionists.”
Roderick looked out the window, but it was still too dark to see much. Dawn was fast approaching, but a thick fog still clung to the city, and the dark still had not dissipated.
“Anthony Tidkins,” Roderick muttered, after returning his attention once more to the list of guests.
Tidkins was a figure in The Mysteries of London, a long-running penny dreadful. The significance of the name was not lost on Roderick. A member of the Resurrectionists named after Anthony Tidkins had to be someone of importance. After all, Anthony Tidkins was known as the Resurrection Man.
“Interestingly, Dr. Allen’s name does not appear on this list,” said Roderick.
“Doesn’t mean he wasn’t there,” Taggert replied.
Roderick gave him a reluctant nod.
“True. But I think we both already know that Dr. Allen had nothing to do with Lord Connor’s death, except as a scapegoat.”
“If that’s true, why the coverup? Why make Connor’s death look like the work of Dr. Allen? Why bother? They didn’t cover up any of the other deaths.”
“For once, you’re asking the right questions. My influence must be rubbing off on you. Anyway, I’ve been giving that some thought,” Roderick told him. “But there are still too many questions, and not enough answers.”
The carriage rolled to a stop.
“Perhaps we’ll get some more of those answers now,” said Taggert, looking out the window. “We’re here.”
The sun was finally beginning to set, as Roderick stepped out onto the pavement outside a narrow street in Holborn. Taggert directed him to an unimpressive brick building that looked in desperate need of maintenance. Roderick had to step around the body of a drunk who’d passed out on the pavement, trousers soaked in his own urine.
“Lovely place you’ve brought me to, Mr. Taggert,” he said, picking Bailey up off the ground, wrinkling his nose.
“Welcome to the Melbourne Club,” said Inspector Taggert, opening the door of the club. It was unlocked.
Roderick set about opening the curtains to let some light in, keeping a cautious eye on Bertrand Melbourne, whose body occupied the center of the clubroom.
“What sort of club is this?” he asked, taking in the Melbourne’s distasteful sense of decor, the grimy windows, the dirt-stained carpets. He decided to leave his shoes on. “What sort of club men would this kind of place attract?”
“The sort that couldn’t afford a membership somewhere else, I imagine.”
“Right you are,” said Roderick. “Now, let’s take a look at the body, shall we? Be a dear and make sure he’s actually dead, will you?”</Text>
            <Notes>“I believe Lord Connor was a Resurrectionist.”
“You think Dr. Allen killed one of his own?” said Taggert.

“I suspect that whatever was in Connor’s safe belonged to the Resurrectionists. Perhaps Connor was supposed to hand it over, but he had a change of heart. His fellow Resurrectionists simply had him killed and hired a thief to steal it back.”</Notes>

            <Title>Scene Three</Title>
            <Synopsis>Annabel and the Penny Dreadful crew battles the Beast.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Mr. Lockwood joined Professor Ashcroft at the window, and looked out at the fearsome beast, lit only by moon and lamplight. Both men were speechless as they stared in abject terror at the Beast in the darkness. The captain’s voice from the exterior of The Penny Dreadful broke the silence. The Agents hurriedly made their way up a short flight of stairs, which opened to the crew cabin, Ashcroft and Lockwood following in their wake. They made their way through the cabin, barely causing the crewmen to turn their heads, busy as they were with their own work.
Mr. O pushed open the hatch, letting in a powerful gust of air that whistled and howled its way into the cabin.
“Captain Merrick,” said Mr. O, bracing himself against the railing.
Miss Monday lingered by the door, preferring not to venture past the relative safety of its threshold.
“Good God, man,” said Captain Merrick, “I never imagined-”
“Nor I,” said Mr. O, though his voice was utterly calm. “It is quite unlike any of the specimens I have seen before.”
…
“No wonder you wanted me aboard,” Miss Monday said under her breath. Mr. O had to move closer to hear her. “This must be connected to Anthony Tidkins.”
Mr. O grimaced. It was the expression she might have expected him to make if he’d been caught in a lie. Which meant…what? She hadn’t the slightest idea.
“I’ll explain later,” said Mr. O. “At any rate, now is not the time to be worrying about that. To your battle stations, ladies and gentlemen. Let’s squash this bug.”
Mr. Palmer had already settled at his station, where a gun had been mounted and a lifetime’s supply of ammunition had been loaded. A moment later, he had released the safety, aimed the weapon through its scope, and unloaded a hundred bullets into the abominable cockroach.
“Thank you, Dr. Gatling,” he said, whistling in appreciation of the weapon as the bullets struck the monster's shell.
The sound of the creature’s outrage drowned out his words. Shrill, ear-shatteringly loud, and utterly unnatural.
But the bullets seemed to bounce off the creature’s hard shell, each round as insignificant to the magnificent beast as an ant to a man. All they'd done was alert the bug to their presence. The Beast whipped its frightful head around and looked straight at The Penny Dreadful. Its flight was clumsy, its maneuverability awkward. But that was hardly cause for comfort.
"I think it sees us," Mr. O remarked.
It flew toward them.
“Shit!” shouted Mr. Palmer, his eyes widening.
“Evasive manoeuvres, men!” cried Captain Merrick. He shouted into a cone-shaped device, which must have conducted his voice, tinny and distorted, into every section of the ship. “Hoist the mizzenmast!”
Miss Monday felt the ship start to ease backward, heard the ship’s sail unfurl. Too slow.
The creature’s antenna struck the side of the ship. Its impact shuddered through the craft. Wood shattered into pieces, and the world seemed to turn on its side. The clouds seemed to tip over like clumsy white sheep. Miss Monday grasped a railing and held tight. Her feet lifted off the ground, and her hand slid along the railing. Her grip was tenuous, but with a grunt of effort she managed to swing her other arm around and get a hold of the railing. Finally, the ship righted itself.
“Everyone alright?” she heard the captain’s voice.
“Fine,” she replied, though she felt like she might be sick. She hated flying, but she hated showing any sign of weakness while in the company of men even more.
Keeping a hand on the railing, she took a moment to survey the aftermath of the creature’s retaliation. Mr. Palmer was still in his seat, as he’d strapped himself in. The captain had likewise latched himself down. But she’d lost sight of the creature. It had disappeared in the darkness. She whirled around, looking for it. Then it occurred to her.
“Where is Mr. O?”
There was no time to wonder about that. Somewhere in the darkness, they heard the distinct sound of mechanical whirring. The monster’s guns had switched on.
“Get down!” Miss Monday cried.
They hit the floor. Bullets whizzed by the Captain’s head, only narrowly missing him.
Miss Monday couldn’t see if Palmer or Lockwood had taken shelter, and she still couldn’t see Mr. O, but she could hear bullets ringing off the dirigible’s armour, which suddenly seemed dangerously frail. She knew the armour wouldn’t hold out for long. And if the armour that covered the balloons was finally penetrated, the hydrogen-filled ballonets would explode with just the slightest spark, engulfing them in flames.
“Captain!” she cried. “The shields!”
He pulled a lever, and a wall of thick plate metal swung up to shield the balloons. Bullets pinged off the metal wall, ricocheting dangerously.
Miss Monday took the opportunity to load her blunderbuss. The nice thing about a blunderbuss was that you could load it with just about anything. Gravel. Sand. But hers was a modified dragoon, built to accommodate much larger projectiles. When Mr. Palmer looked back at her, he saw her loading it with something that looked suspiciously like a grenade.
She grinned back at him.
The sound of cannon fire deafened them both momentarily, but it was a reassuring sound. It meant that Mr. Palmer was operating the cannons.
Where was Mr. O? Her mind kept returning to that question. She couldn’t let it worry her. Whether he’d been struck by a stray bullet or plummeted off the edge of the airship, her task was to slay the beast. Take it down before it destroyed the ship. Which at the moment seemed highly likely.</Text>

            <Text>Years Ago

Much as he disliked the notion of sharing his story with the stranger in the cell beside him, curiosity outweighed his hesitation. If there was any chance the Mad Priest could dispel even some elements of the mystery of his present circumstances, it was worth it.
And so he began.
His entire life’s story, laid out in the darkness before a man he’d just met. He skipped over those details of his life that he deemed trivial, hurried the story along in favour of those events most current in his mind and therefore most likely to be relevant to his imprisonment.
He told the Priest of his unusual hobby and the resulting secret society he’d formed with those few others whose interests also included the investigation and capture of notorious and dangerous criminals.
He spoke of meeting the love of his life, the beautiful Mademoiselle Singe, while abroad in Paris. He talked of how he fell, head over heals, into a love that was inescapable, bordering on obsessive. How thoughts of her filled his daydreams and his sleeping dreams alike. What it was about her that was so captivating, he could not place; all that he knew was that he wanted to spend every waking minute breathing in her scent, touching her face, listening to her voice.
He spoke of his discovery of Allen’s Street, where it was believed the nefarious Dr. Allen had lived and where he’d carried out at least some of his most heinous acts. “Previous to the doctor’s association with the street, it had apparently gone unnamed,” he explained, “At some point in the street’s history, the doctor’s name had stuck, and a street sign had been raised.”
He spoke of the Moirae, who he discovered during his exploration of Allen’s Street. Their tea house was located just down the street from the doctor’s supposed address. Mr. Sinews had wandered in one day after breaking into the abandoned residence at 44 Allen’s Street, where the doctor was supposed to have lived.
“It must be fate,” Atropos had said when he’d stepped through the door, “That you’ve wandered into our house.”
He spoke of meeting there again, and of inviting his fellow members of the secret society to join him. He recalled how Rachelle had asked him not to go, practically begged him, but he was too caught up in the affair to give it up, too intrigued, and he’d gone anyway.
He told the priest of his absinthe-induced hallucinations. The spiders, the snakes, the moths. He spoke of the strange tarot reading. The whore, the somnambulist, and the five of tentacles.
And how Atropos had urged him to abandon his search for Dr. Allen. And how, thinking only of Rachelle, he’d consented.
His voice growing weak and broken, he spoke of his arrest, and his subsequent trial. He spoke of the lawyer who’d described in great detail each of Dr. Allen’s crimes.
Mr. Sinews knew all of them. He knew details he ought not to have. He knew the words of every phonograph transcription kept in the police files. He knew them by memory. He could not deny that.
But then the lawyer had described the details of Rachelle’s murder, details with which Mr. Sinews was not familiar. He could hardly bear hearing them the first time, but he repeated them, all the same, to the Mad Priest.
He told the priest how he’d demonstrated his innocence in each of the doctor’s crimes; he had alibis for each of them, and his obsessive personality ensured that he still had the documentation that proved he’d been in France at the time of many of Dr. Allen’s murders.
And there were also the testimonials of nearly every member of Mr. Sinews’ secret society, testimonials which confirmed Mr. Sinews could not have been Rachelle’s killer, as he’d been at Allen’s Street when it had occurred.
After Mr. Sinews’ evidence had been presented, he felt entirely confident that his case would be dismissed, that he would be permitted to see Rachelle one last time before she was buried, that he would be able to see Camille and that they might comfort each other during their time of mutual grief. Still, when he’d been pronounced guilty, and the judge had said that he was to be hanged, he had felt impossibly relieved.
His outrage when he’d been thrown in prison instead, was unimaginable.
“There’s been a mistake,” he’d screamed at the guards, “I’m supposed to be put to death.”
“Yes,” said the priest, “I do remember that. You woke me from quite a pleasant slumber. And shortly thereafter, you fell into a deep slumber yourself.”
“Sorry,” said Mr. Sinews.
“Not at all,” said the Priest, “You can only imagine how I raged when I first arrived. How do you think I earned the name Mad Priest?”
Mr. Sinews smiled, despite himself. “You promised you’d tell me what you knew,” he said, “About why I’m here.”
“Ah,” said the priest, “You are quite right. I will tell you what I know.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene Two</Title>
            <Text>“He’s dead alright.”
Roderick had to agree with the Chief Inspector’s assessment. There was no way, even if he had been infected with the same disease that had plagued Lord Connor, that the man was still alive.
His jaw had been sliced off with a surgeon’s knife, his eyes scooped out, his arms and stomach cut into. There would have been a staggering amount of blood, though the place had been cleaned up since then. It was still a mess, but that wasn’t owing to the gruesome murder that had taken place here.
Roderick took in the feats of engineering the murderer had implanted in the cadaver. The body had been expertly painted with varnish, to stop him from rotting, vivisected and stitched back together again. Rivets, glass, and brass were affixed to his hollow chest. Inside, he was filled with machinery. His face had also been mutilated and dressed up to look like an absurd puppet.
“Any idea who we’re looking at?”
“Could be Melbourne,” Taggert replied. “It’s his club, after all. Then again, might just be a club member, or the butler. Who knows? Won’t be easy to identify him in this state. What do you make of it?”
“Do you have any candy? I think better when I have candy.”
Taggert fished into his pockets, but came up empty. He shrugged.
“I don’t know,” Roderick snapped. “You can tell me I’m crazy, if that’s what you think, but I am still not sure Dr. Allen had anything to do with this.”
He started probing the victim, rotating the cogs and gears, gently prodding the anatomized flesh, sniffing the resin that covered him.
“No message,” he said. “Someone’s already been here. Who reported this?”
“One of the club men.”
“And he didn’t mention any message?” Roderick asked, unusually impatient.
“No message.”
Roderick ground his teeth in frustration.
“Perhaps we can get someone to take him apart. There’s got to be a wax scroll hidden inside him somewhere. If we can find that, perhaps the message can be played on another phonograph.”
“We’ve tried that before, Roderick. Remember? It’s designed to destroy the scroll after it’s been played once.”
“Yes, but…” Roderick persisted, as if by sheer force of will he could get the message to play. “Perhaps this time will be different. It might not even be Dr. Allen’s work.”
Taggert fingered the ends of his moustache, teasing them up. His fingers came away waxy.
“Last time, it was the messages that led me to identify Dr. Allen.”
“Right. And we still never caught him.”
Roderick scooped up Bailey, who’d been sniffing curiously around the room. The dog panted happily in his master’s arms, tongue sticking out one side of his mouth.
“No witnesses. No message. And without any clothing, or even a face, there’s no way to identify our John Doe. We have the message, we basically have nothing,” he said.
Taggert raised his eyebrows. This wasn’t like Roderick. Normally, visiting the site of a murder made him manic, gave him a boundless, contagious energy. He could step into a room and glean ten different things about his murderer just from the smell of the air.
Roderick paused at the door.
“This place is a den of filth. No respectable gentleman would be caught dead here. And yet, it is in a relatively fashionable neighbourhood, the bar is well-stocked, and the furniture tasteless but expensive. We can assume, therefore, that illegal gambling or some other form of criminal activity takes place here. The selling of drugs, perhaps? So, the members are criminals. Let us review the facts. Lord Connor was killed by a Resurrectionist—perhaps Dr. Allen, perhaps not. He was also robbed. His safe was cracked. Most likely, this was done by a professional thief. Earlier, I posited the theory that Lord Connor was a Resurrectionist and that he’d been killed for refusing to hand over whatever was in his safe. We can thus deduce that the robber was hired by the Resurrectionists. We also know that the Resurrectionists like to tie up their loose ends. We can safely assume that John Doe was one such loose end. Perhaps we’ve found the man that facilitated the hiring of our professional thief.”
He let out a weary sigh and patted Bailey’s head.
“Beyond that, we’ve still got nothing. I’m going back to Connor’s. Perhaps there’s something there that I missed. I suggest you do whatever you can to recover the wax scroll, just in case. And I still need to speak with Miss Karnstein and Mr. Sinews.”</Text>

He turned around, at the sound of her voice. She stepped back in a panic, drawing her pistol. When her heart settled, she turned to the nearest table, reached for the oil lamp, and adjusted the dial until the lamp brightened.
Melbourne was naked, but this was not what had unsettled Annabel. He’d been disemboweled. With surgical precision, his gut had been cut open. Around the opening, a porthole had been attached, like a window into the man’s insides. Hollowed like a jack o’ lantern, Melbourne’s insides had been stuffed with clockwork parts, which ticked behind a pane of glass.
No stranger to the fusion of flesh and machinery, Annabel’s eyes were not drawn to Melbourne’s clockwork stomach, but to his face. The blood had dried, but that made it no less gruesome. His eyes had been plucked out. The sockets were stuffed with black marbles. Black feathers had been stuck to his skin with a sticky resin. His nose and mouth were hidden beneath a beak made of brass. Gears were affixed to the joints of the beak.
She thought of Mr. O’s description of the lunatic boffins. She recalled the articles in the newspapers, and knew whose work this was. Dr. Allen. Annabel wasn’t squeamish. Of course, she felt a healthy amount of nausea at the sight of Melbourne’s disfigurement, but that didn’t mean she wasn’t curious.
Unlike Connor, Melbourne was definitely dead. He couldn’t harm her. His legs were affixed to the floor, pinned in place by metal stakes, meant to keep him upright after death. But Annabel knew more about the Resurrectionists than she’d let on. She also knew that if this really was the their work, there would be a message.
She reached up, put her hands on the gears of Melbourne’s beak. It wouldn’t turn. Her brow creased. There was a keyhole, she saw upon a closer look. I wonder, she thought, drawing the brass key she wore around her neck.
She was unsurprised to discover that the key fit. The gear rotated, and Melbourne’s beak opened. A recording began to play. It started with the sound of a crow, cawing incessantly. This was the first time Annabel had been witness to the marvel of auditory recording technology. There must have been a tiny phonograph, hidden somewhere within the brass mouth.</Notes>

            <Title>Scene Two</Title>
            <Synopsis>Roderick sends a message to Inspector Taggert via Rémy and returns to Connor’s mansion in pursuit of further clues. He discovers a connection between Connor and Varney the Vampire and a note in Connor’s edition of The Horrors of Allen’s Street.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Roderick had decided to stop at home before heading back to Lord Connor’s.
He had dressed more sensibly, in a smart pair of black and red striped trousers, a grey vest and shirt, black cravat, white gloves, and most importantly, his cane. Not merely decorative and stylish, the cane doubled as a weapon. As any sensible gentleman in London knew, the city was a dangerous place to be without that most crucial accessory and a reasonable knowledge of the gentleman’s martial art, bartitsu. Roderick, being pragmatic, had also made a study of cannes de combat, and could disarm a vagrant of a knife without so much as sullying his shoes by stepping off the sidewalk. That generally left his would-be robber feeling quite silly for having made the attempt. On the off-chance that a blunt weapon would not suffice, the cane also contained a hidden sword. The curse of the academically minded, of course, was a constantly active mind that often caused him to forget his street smarts and thus he often left the house without his cane. Occasionally, without his shoes. Once, without his pants.
Not this time.
This time, Roderick had all his ducks in a row. His shoes upon his feet, his trousers on his legs, his cane in hand, he turned to the door. He had his hand on it when the knock came. For a number of reasons, not least of which being that he had secrets to keep, Roderick did not have any servants, so he answered the door himself. A familiar, young, and attractive man stood in the doorway. Roderick opened his mouth and stammered.
“Roderick,” said the lad.
“Yes,” Roderick confirmed.
“You’ve forgotten, again, haven’t you?”
At last, Roderick recalled. He could not, for the life of him, remember why it was that he had decided to take up such a ridiculous hobby as painting, but he now remembered that this young man was one of his models. Ah yes, he thought, looking at the dark-haired specimen with approval. That was why.
“My dear boy, of course I haven’t forgotten you.” He put a hand on the lad’s shoulder, smiling warmly. “But I’m afraid we’ll have to reschedule.”
He looked disappointed. Roderick consoled him with a kiss upon the cheek.
“Cannot be prevented,” he said. “My apologies. As you’re here, I wonder if you might be amenable to doing me a favour?”
The young man nodded all too eagerly.
“I need a message delivered to Inspector Taggert, with Scotland Yard,” he said. Another nod from the model.
Roderick took out a piece of paper and a pen, and wrote down the message. He scrawled a quick message, not bothering to go into much detail. He’d been thinking, as was often the case, and had come to an unsettling conclusion. He would have to speak with the Inspector directly. But for now this would have to suffice.
“Charles G, ran newspaper, reported on Resurrectionists. Silenced. Lord C, defected Resurrectionist? Infection deliberate, effectively silenced. Parson S, murder hobbyist, took an interest in Resurrectionists. Silenced. Think who else may be a threat to the Resurrectionists. Your life may be in danger. Take care. Roderick.”
He held out the note.
“This is for Inspector Taggert’s eyes only, do you understand?” he said, looking the boy in the eyes, only relinquishing the note when the boy confirmed that no one should see the note but Taggert himself. He kissed the boy again, this time full on the mouth.
The lad blushed, grinning as he hurried off to perform Roderick’s errand.
“Good lad, don’t you think?” Roderick said to Bailey, still trying to remember the boy’s name. Eric, he thought, maybe. Or Adam, perhaps. Rémy? Aha, yes, that was it. Rémy. He shrugged, stepping outside. “I’ll be back shortly,” he said, closing the door, cane luckily still in hand. 
He sighed whistfully. The boy obviously adored him, and Roderick felt a pang of guilt for leading him on. Guilt coupled with longing. It was not that Roderick didn’t return his affection. But Roderick’s mind was occupied by more than just romantic affections. He didn’t have time to allow fickle things like love to distract him.
He hired a fly, and half an hour later, Roderick walked along the walkway through the garden of a vast mansion, still shaking off the curious sensation that he had fallen down a rabbit hole and was likely to open his eyes and find himself in his own bed at any moment.
It would hardly have surprised anyone if Roderick were to claim that vampires were real. If anything, it was his logical, sceptic mind that people found eccentric. Belief in the supernatural was not merely normal; it was in vogue. Fashionable men and women had seances to contact their loved ones from beyond the grave. Ghosts, vampires, werewolves. What reason did anyone have to doubt their existence? Really, it was only the upper classes and the highly educated that doubted such things, and Roderick was upper middle class at best, and self-educated.
His father had been a policeman, and an alcoholic. Edward Steen had made a modest salary as a detective at Scotland Yard, in spite of his inability to refuse a glass of whiskey when one was proffered. He’d retired young, if retirement was the right word. The truth was that he’d drank himself out of a job. He still pursued a career as a detective, but as a consultant for hire, not entirely unlike Roderick. Roderick hadn’t seen his father in years, and almost never thought about him.
Edward Steen was superstitious. He believed that murderers were possessed by devils, that sin was a gateway for demons to cross over into our world. Perhaps that was exactly why Roderick was so steadfastly logical. Perhaps this was also why he never let a drop of liquor touch his lips. Edward Steen had also always preferred cats to dogs.
But then, suppose an irrefutable fact presented itself, one which made superstition more logical than superstition. If pragmatism must prevail, then Roderick was forced to consider that even myths have a foundation in truth. Here, in this house, Roderick had seen the dead rise, only to feast on the flesh of the living.
He hated being back here. Yet he placed a gloved hand on the door and pushed it open. The door was unlocked, which was not entirely alarming, and the house appeared to be abandoned. Apparently Lady Connor had retreated to her father’s house in the country after her husband’s death. The servants, consequently, had abandoned the Connor household, so it was dark and quiet once Roderick closed the door. The only light was from the early morning sun, dimmed by layers of smog, flickering between the curtains.
Roderick immediately set about turning the lamps on, and as was his fashion, he removed his shoes and popped a piece of candy into his mouth. Strawberry liquorice. He chewed loudly as he made his way through the house. He ought to have made his way straight for Connor’s office, but he was still feeling paranoid after his encounter with the vampires in the alley and subsequently the Moirae, so he preferred not to leave a single corner of the house unchecked or unlit.
Finally, Roderick at last set his sights on Connor’s office. Tired after his long ordeal, he clomped his way upstairs, lighting the lamps as he went.
The door to Connor’s office was still sticky with what Roderick believed was congealed blood. It swung open with a groan. There was a chill in the room, a cool breeze stirring the curtains from the open window. It still smelt of death, though the police had already done their due diligence of ridding the place of the bodies.
Some of the pages from Connor’s desk had fallen to the floor, but Roderick was quick to sort through them and conclude that the page he sought wasn’t among them. He flicked through the papers on the desk and quickly found it. Blank, except for a single symbol. The crow’s head sigil of the Resurrectionists.
He held the page up to his face and sniffed. He nodded, satisfied.
“As I suspected,” he said aloud. “Lemon juice.”
He fished into his pockets, found a match, and lit it. Careful not to burn the paper, he held the match beneath it. Gradually, the ink revealed itself, the letters oxidizing in the heat and becoming an ugly shade of brown. He flicked his wrist and the match burned out. He set it down on Connor’s desk and turned his attention to the message revealed from the invisible ink.
It was a name.
Francis Varney.
He mouthed the name aloud, silently contemplating its significance. “Varney the Vampire,” he said aloud after a while. He was recalling the character from the penny dreadfuls.
The Resurrectionists had once been the talk of the town. Their controversial essays, missives, and manifestos had delighted and horrified the citizens of London, printed in newspapers and scientific magazines alike. Their popularity peaked with a horrendous scandal when one of their members was implicated in several brutal murders.
While the murderer amongst them was eventually apprehended, the police had made an effort to round up the Resurrectionists’ other members as accomplices, but the task had proved impossible. All of their literature had been published under noms de plume, though Roderick’s father had once posited that this was not why the police had been unable to track them. His theory was that the police had been paid to feign incompetence. And while Roderick disagreed with his father about a great many things, this was not a point of contention, though he would not have been entirely surprised to learn that their incompetence was in fact legitimate.
As for the names, they were easy enough to remember. 
They would assume the name of a popular character from a penny dreadful, generally a villainous character.
Sweeney Todd, The String of Pearls. Spring-heeled Jack, The Terror of London. Anthony Tidkins, The Mysteries of London. Dr. Allen, Tales of Dead London.
Varney the Vampire, A Feast of Blood.
Following the scandal, the newspapers had printed stories and essays featuring numerous other supposed members of the Murder Club, though many of the names and stories were obviously fake, which made matters even more difficult for the police. Roderick knew the stories better than most; his father had worked the case until he died.
The connection to Varney the Vampire was not lost on Roderick, given the plague of the undead that seemed to be spreading throughout the city. But the real question was, was Connor naming himself as Varney the Vampire, or was he naming his murderer? It was impossible to connect the pen names to the real names of the men who used them, impossible to connect a member of the Resurrectionists by pseudonym alone. Of course, if, as Roderick suspected, it was Anthony Tidkins that had killed Connor, then he could not have been naming his murderer. Henry Connor was Francis Varney, a Resurrectionist.
But there was more to this. He needed another clue. Only a moment later he’d deduced where he might find one. Evidently Connor was the sort of man taken to leaving coded messages behind. Clearly he’d known his life had been in danger, and he’d wanted to leave a clue that could be pursued to track his killers. Hence the invisible ink.
Roderick turned his attention to the bookshelf that lined one wall of Connor’s office, his eyes quickly sorting through the titles on the spines of the books until he found the one he was looking for.
He pulled a volume from the shelf. The Feast of Blood, an epic tome and a reprinting of the original serialized stories in which Varney had appeared. With some two hundred or more chapters, Roderick hadn’t the slightest idea of where to proceed, but he flipped open the book all the same.
Somewhere, there had to be a hidden message. He flipped through its pages, but there was nothing to draw his eye. He returned to the beginning, noted the name of the publisher. Grimmer and Sons. He set the book down and turned to another of the books on the shelf. The Mysteries of London. This, of course, was the book that featured The Resurrection Man, namesake of the Resurrectionists. But again, there were no immediately obvious messages to be gleaned from the book’s pages. Again, however, he noted the name of the publisher. Grimmer and Sons.
One last tome. Tales of Dead London. Printed by Grimmer and Sons. There was an inscription on the first page, “My old friend, I hope you will enjoy this collection of stories about your much-revered Dr. Allen. Charles Grimmer.”
Roderick scoffed. He knew a veiled insult when he saw one. And this was a passive aggressive gift, if ever there was one. Clearly there was some personal history between Lord Henry Connor and Mr. Charles Grimmer. Your much-revered Dr. Allen...Was this enough to prove that Lord Connor was a Resurrectionist? After all, Dr. Allen was a known killer. That he revered the man certainly seemed damning.
He put the book beneath his arm, picked up his cane, and headed back outside to where his cabriolet awaited. His conversation with Inspector Taggert would have to wait.
“Do you know the location of the Grimmer and Sons Printing Company?” he asked the driver.
“Does the pope wear a funny hat?” he asked rhetorically.
Roderick paused to think. “Very good,” he said, paying the man. “Off we go then.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene 69</Title>
            <Text>“We need to get back to the Dreadful,” said Palmer. “It isn’t safe here any more.”
Jonathan nodded, keeping one eye on Roderick, whose fists were clenched and trembling.
“Grab whatever necessities you may require, and we’ll be on our way,” said Jonathan. “Miss Monday, Roderick keeps a wardrobe of lady’s clothes over there, for his female models. You may find something in your size, if you need a change of clothes.”
“Thank you,” she said, and headed for the wardrobe.
“Roderick, can I help you gather your effects? Anything you think you’ll need?”
“Cocaine,” Roderick answered.
“Are you sure that’s—”
“Cocaine,” Roderick snapped. “Don’t offer to help if you aren’t being sincere. The box is on the bookshelf over there.”
“Right,” Jonathan answered. “Anything else?”
“I suppose a change of clothes might not be a bad idea,” he said, a bit more subdued. “Whatever I have in black.”
Jonathan returned a minute later with a black shirt, black pants, and a black top hat. A pair of black boots. Roderick hadn’t moved from the doorway. He was still barefoot, his feet utterly filthy.
Jonathan headed for the door and eased it open. The airship was still floating above Roderick’s house, a hundred feet off the ground. As the fog was beginning to clear, and dawn was beginning to break, Jonathan had an almost clear view of the zombies walking through the streets. More to the point, they had a clear view of him.
The nearest group of zombies was over a hundred feet away, just down the street, but there were hundreds of them. Another group of them on the adjacent street, and a third group on the opposite side of Roderick’s street. They didn’t seem to have seen Jonathan and his group yet, but they would need to signal the airship.
This would be risky. Jonathan had taken a flare gun with him from the airship. He drew the gun now, and aimed it at the sky.
“We ready?” Jonathan asked.
“Ready,” Palmer answered.
“Yes, sah,” said Kip.
Miss Monday and Clementine nodded.
“Good,” said Jonathan.
He fired the flare gun. A hundred pale eyes looked up at once as the flare burst into a brilliant green and streaked across the sky. It sizzled and cracked, trailing smoke. It hit the ground fifty feet from Roderick’s doorstep and lay there sizzling.
“They must have seen it,” said Kass, as the ship’s propellers began to whir almost immediately after the flare landed. The Dreadful surged toward the flare. It was astonishingly fast, given its vast size. Jonathan had to remind himself that it was, after all, lighter than air.
Meanwhile, the dead began to move as well, slowly ambling toward the smoking flare, moving as one enormous mass of rotten bodies.
“Quickly!” Jonathan cried.
Without losing a moment, the party was on their way to meet the airship, hoping they would reach the ship’s ladder before the hungry dead could get at them.
Jonathan saw something drop out of the bottom of the airship and tumble down towards the earth. It bounced as it unspooled, and hung, suspended ten feet above the ground. It was the rope ladder, Jonathan realized. It was still too far to reach.
The zombies were closing in on them from all directions. If they didn’t make the ship, they might not make it back to the house now either. This was it. They had reached a point of no return.
He heard a cry of alarm, and swung around to see what had caused it. He saw it immediately—some of the zombies were quicker than the others, and one of them had already reached the group. It had its hands around Clem’s neck. Jonathan raised his pistol, but he couldn’t get a shot. Not without risking hitting Kass herself.
It was Miss Monday, who was nearest to Kass, that came to her aide, putting herself between Kass and the zombie. With tremendous force, she seized the creature by one arm and hauled it roughly back. It tumbled to the ground on top of her. Abandoning its intended victim, it now tried for Miss Monday’s throat, snarling and biting. It nearly had its teeth around her throat. Miss Monday was on her back, the creature on top of her, just as she’d been when he found her with Lord Connor. The zombie was going to tear her throat out.
Jonathan again raised his pistol—again, he couldn’t make the shot.
“Help her!” he cried.
He was holstering his pistol and rushing to help her himself, even as the creature sunk its teeth into her arm.
She didn’t cry out, or give any indication of her pain, so it might not have broken the skin, but Jonathan couldn’t be certain. All he could do was watch as Kass hurried back to help Miss Monday. The formidable mechanic managed to break the creature’s hold on Miss Monday, and with her rusty pipe, smash its brains in.
By now, even the slowest of the zombies were closing in on them, but the airship had descended enough that they could now reach the ladder. He helped Monday to her feet, and shouted for her to go first.
He raised his weapon as the zombies narrowed the gap, forming a tight circle with Kass, Kip, and Roderick, while Miss Monday climbed. He fired into the throng, just barely hitting his target.
“You next, Roderick,” he shouted.
He managed to get Bailey into a little duffel bag, which he slung over his shoulder, and began to ascend.
“Quickly!” he called.
He had to reload his pistol, which he did while Kip covered him. Meanwhile, Kass began to scamper up the rope after Roderick, leaving only Jonathan and Kip on the ground.
With a fresh pair of bullets in his pistol, Jonathan pointed it another incoming zombie, close enough to hit at point blank range. He shoved the muzzle into its face and pulled the trigger. He was rewarded with an explosive spray of blood and brain, and the sight of a necrotic dandy falling to the ground dead.
“Yore next, sah,” said Kip, patting Jonathan on the back. “Ah’ll cover ya.”
Jonathan didn’t argue. He grabbed a hold of the rope and hoisted himself up, one rung at a time. He paused to fire a shot at one of the zombies, which had come up from behind Kip.
“Thank you, sah,” Kip called, swinging around to see the fallen corpse at his feet. “Much obliged.”
With that, Kip began to climb up after Jonathan. Even before they finished climbing, the ship unleashed a load of water from its ballasts, causing the ship to rise suddenly.
Jonathan lost his footing. He clung desperately to the ladder, as his feet slipped off the rungs. The ladder jerked violently. One of his hands slipped, and he found himself holding on by one hand. He held tight, and scrambled to get his foot back on the rungs. He fingers were slipping.
He looked down and saw that one of the zombies was climbing the ladder after them.
“Kip!” he cried, scrambling to find purchase.
By sheer luck, he managed to get one foot back on the rung. He almost lost it again—the ladder bounced violently as Kip tried to shake the zombie off the ladder, kicking madly at the creature’s head. Somehow, it managed to hold on. Finally, rather than shaking it loose, he managed to kill it, crushing its half-rotten skull with his boot. Still, its fingers clung to the ladder.
“Talk about a death grip, eh, sah?”
Jonathan grasped for the ladder, still hanging on for dear life. As the rope ladder stilled, he managed to grab on. He laughed nervously. “Death grip. Yes, very good, Kip. Well said.”
Finally, they were out of the zombies’ reach. Heart hammering, Jonathan paused to glance down at the unliving mob, and let out a sigh of relief. Then he remembered Miss Monday’s arm, and he renewed his efforts to climb up after her.</Text>

        <Document ID="817">
            <Title>Scene Two</Title>
            <Text>Jonathan was on his feet in an instant. The conversation quickly died, as a rain-soaked man in a plague doctor’s mask shuffled through the doorway and shed his jacket. The temporary lull in conversation was filled with the noise of the masked man wiping his rain-soaked feet on the mat in the doorway, and with the drunken slur of Edward Steen’s voice. Jonathan scanned the Tea House for a back entrance. Had he been followed here, somehow? Had the airship been spotted in the area by the Resurrectionists?
“No, do not be alarmed,” the man protested, seeing Jonathan’s cautious expression and the glint of steel at his belt. Jonathan was armed and had taken the precaution of reloading his revolver. “I hope you can forgive me for arriving in the mask of our adversary.”
“You were at Lord Connor’s ball, as well, I presume?” asked Parson.
“I was,” the newcomer admitted, “But how did you know?”
“Lucky guess,” said Sinews.
“I see. Anyway, as I said, I do apologize for any alarm I might have caused, but I simply value my anonymity in this matter, as I am sure you can understand, given the circumstances. I thought it might be fitting to choose a mask like Dr. Allen’s own. In my defence, it is in my nature to be overly theatrical. To tell you the truth, though, I believe it is only because I was wearing the mask that I’m still alive.”
Not removing his hand from the gun at his belt, Jonathan settled back into his seat, keeping a cautious eye on the newcomer. Perhaps coming here had been a mistake. Or perhaps he too should have thought to wear a mask.
Pardoning himself for the interruption and for his tardiness, the masked man shook the hand of each of the gentlemen at the table, including Jonathan, who looked into the man’s eyes and saw that they were pale and red. What little skin could be seen was white enough to identify him as an albino.
“Again, sorry,” he began, “I must have hired half a hundred cabs before I found a driver who would even admit to the existence of this god-forsaken street. Whose idea was it to meet here, of all places?”
“No apology necessary,” said Parson. “Punctuality is a flaw of character; it requires that responsibilities take precedence over idle pleasures. It should therefore be avoided, whenever possible.”
“Mr. Parson Sinews,” Jonathan said, introducing their host. “It is by his invitation that we’ve convened here.”
“A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Sinews,” the mysterious newcomer replied without the necessary inflection to suggest even a modicum of sincerity.
“Please, call me Parson. That is, Parson by name, not profession.”
“Then you’re not of the religious persuasion?” he queried, with irony enough in his inflection to counter Parson’s own.
Jonathan coughed. “Mr. Sinews, as you may know, is the head of this little Committee. And…you are?”
“Forgive me,” the man replied. “Once again, I defer to my preference for anonymity. But so that you have something to call me, I shall offer up a nom de plume. You may think of me as Mr. Anthony Tidkins.”
“Mr. Tidkins, what did you mean about the mask being the only reason you’re still alive?” asked Jonathan.
“There were Resurrectionists at Lord Connor’s masquerade,” he answered. His voice trembled a bit as he spoke, as if disturbed by the memory. “I believe they mistook me for one of them. If they hadn’t…”
“Indeed. The Resurrectionists are dangerous. In fact, Mr. Grimmer informs us that a man was murdered at the masquerade. Could it be that the Resurrectionists were behind it?”
“Before you arrived, Mr. Sinews was about to address the Committee on the purpose of this meeting, were you not, Mr. Sinews?” said Jonathan, changing the subject. He wasn’t sure he still wished to reveal that it was Connor who died this evening, not in front of this anonymous man in the plague mask. “Should we get back to business?”
“And, Mr. Sinews, for once spare us the gruesome details, if you please. I do hope to be able to keep my dinner,” warned Mrs. Hatton. An age-spotted finger wagged in his direction, though Mrs. Hatton was all smiles. Evidently this was not Mrs. Hatton and Mr. Sinews’ first meeting.
Parson grinned. “The world craves the grotesque. Those who pretend otherwise deceive no one but themselves,” he said.
“Very amusing, Mr. Sinews,” said Tidkins.
“I do aim to please,” Parson replied. He paused to accept a refill of his drink. Unlike Mr. Ocelot and Mrs. Hatton, Mr. Sinews was not drinking tea. He and Steen apparently shared Jonathan’s preference for absinthe, and they were drinking it quite heavily, and although this was a tea house, and not a bar, their hosts had graciously provided beverages that were not on the menu. They had also closed the front door and placed a sign in the window, which read “Closed For Private Function.”
“Who was murdered this evening, Jonathan?” said Parson, not to be deterred.
Jonathan started. To use his name so familiarly when they had only just met! Before he could reply, the newcomer interjected.
“Nearly everyone who had the misfortune of lingering too long at the Connor residence,” he said.
Jonathan turned to look at the newcomer, but was disappointed to see that the mask hid the man’s face. His voice was impassive, but his face might have revealed more. Jonathan thought of Mr. Monday, and wondered if he had escaped unscathed.
“How?” he asked.
“Poison,” he said. “Airborne.”
“How horrific,” said Mrs. Hatton, fanning herself with a little paper fan as if she might faint. Quite the actress, Jonathan thought. As a journalist, it was important to be able to read people, to get the real story. He didn’t believe for an instant that Mrs. Hatton was the sort of woman given to fainting.
“This,” said Parson, hammering home his point upon the table, causing the teacups to rattle. “This is why the Resurrectionists must be apprehended.”
Jonathan’s mind was still fixed on the mass murder that had taken place at the masquerade. It would not be the first time the Resurrectionists had committed murder, but nearly everyone who had the misfortune of lingering too long at the Connor residence…
This was a departure from their usual modus operandi. The Resurrectionists were supposed to be scientists, and even if some of them were mad, they’d never committed murder on such a scale before. What in the hell had Jonathan gotten himself into? One murder had been quite enough already.
“The story takes place here, on Allen’s Street,” Parson was saying when Jonathan’s mind finally caught up to the conversation, “A street so named both for and by the surgeon who was supposed to have practiced here. But forgive me. I’m sure you already know this. After all, it is the reason for your interest, is it not?”
Jonathan’s eyes swept over the room. All eyes were fixed on Parson. Even Steen had quieted to listen to him. But Parson, seeing that he had the room, chose not to unburden them of their curiosity. Instead, he managed to change the subject, and Jonathan was forced to return his attention to drinking. The conversation turned instead to another round of introductions, supposedly for Tidkins’ benefit, then to small talk, as if this was just another pleasant evening out on the town. By the time the conversation returned to the subject for which Jonathan had come here, he supposed he must be nearly as drunk as Edward Steen.
“Allow me to explain,” Parson said finally. He paused to take the slightest sip from his own glass of absinthe, “And please forgive me if I dredge up details with which you are already familiar. This will all go more smoothly if I make the assumption of your ignorance…”
A fair assumption, thought Jonathan.
“The truth of Dr. Allen’s origins is widely disputed,” he went on. Once more, he paused to take a drink. “As Grimmer can surely tell you, most newspapers would have you believe that he was initially hired as a military scientist, charged with the responsibility of creating war-winning soldiers whose very bodies and minds were both chemically and surgically altered.”
This was news to Jonathan. Perhaps his father had known it; if it had been in the papers, he must have.
“This operation was sanctioned by the crown and by the government, but under the direction of the doctor, quickly got out of hand. Supposedly, he began to demand living subjects, and when his superiors refused, he did so without permission. Hundreds of test subjects died to his experiments. He hired a man to bring him subjects, an Irish Giant, who stood at over eight feet tall according to the penny bloods. When the doctor’s experiments came to light, he was relieved of his position and sentenced to be tried for his crimes. At this point, he went into hiding, aided by a scientific society that was sympathetic to his situation. The Murder Club. At this point, they were a gentleman’s club that catered to the scientific community; after they began harbouring Dr. Allen, of course, they were forced into secrecy. Now, there are certain discrepancies among every report you’ll read, but I do not truly believe that Allen’s crimes were entirely of his own accord. The truth, as far as I can surmise, is that Dr. Allen was merely a scapegoat.”
“You mean the experiments were sanctioned,” Jonathan said.
“Not merely sanctioned,” said Parson, “But directed.”
“And when the subjects all died…”
Parson nodded. “They blamed it all on Allen. They needed to hide their mistakes, so they turned him into a bogeyman.”</Text>
            <Comments>What is he saying?
Previously he mentioned that he was wearing the mask to protect his identity, but here he says ge was also at the ball.  Did he wear this mask there knowing the ressurectionists would be there?  Was he trying to infiltrate to get information?  Or did he simply choose this mask for the party, not really concerned about being mistaken as a member?
Maybe have Jonathan notice that no one has come into the tea house?</Comments>

            <Text>“Well?” said the surgeon, when Anthony knocked upon the door.
“Are you Dr. Allen?” he asked nervously. “My father sent me.”
The surgeon nodded. He stood aside and beckoned for the boy to enter.
The lock on the door of his father’s cabinet had not stopped Anthony from attempting to learn his father’s trade. Anthony had merely been forced to call upon the expertise of one of the boys in his entourage, a boy who knew how to pick locks.
At last, in what was presumably an effort to rid his father of the nuisance of his son, Anthony had been sent here. He was to be apprenticed to a surgeon—one who was more patient than Anthony’s father, and who ran a medical school—in London. Anthony was eleven years old at the time.
“Come in,” said the surgeon. “How was the journey here? Long, I imagine. Did you travel by train?”
“No, sir, by airship,” said Anthony.
The surgeon led him to a dining room, pulled out a chair and gestured for Anthony to sit. As he sat, Anthony took in the room. The first thing that he noticed was that the surgeon’s books were not behind lock and key. They were not even neatly organised on a single shelf, but spread about the room, some of them open and marked up by the surgeon’s own pen. Most of the books were the same as the ones his father owned, but there were some that were unfamiliar.
He also had a number of preparations in glass jars—lizards with two tails, dissected internal organs, jellyfish, baby crocodiles, a monkey's skull.
The surgeon disappeared through the hallway for only a moment, and when he returned he was accompanied by a servant, who laid out a plate of food or the boy. Anthony dug in, but amidst eating, he began to pester the surgeon with questions.
“What book is that?” he asked.
“Gray’s Anatomy,” said the surgeon.
“Oh,” said Anthony, a bit disappointed. “I’ve read that. Yours looks different from the copy my father owns.”
“This is the American edition,” the surgeon explained. “So you’ve read Henry Gray?”
“I’ve practically memorized it,” said Anthony, more enthusiastic than boastful. “It’s fascinating, isn’t it?” Almost immediately, he became distracted. “What’s that one?” he asked around a mouthful of bread.
“The Institutes and Practice of Surgery. Have you read it?”
Anthony nodded.
“You like to read, don’t you?” said the surgeon.
Anthony nodded again.
“We have that in common," said the surgeon. "But I prefer reading bodies to reading books. Beginning tomorrow, we’ll be taking a more practical approach to your studies.”
“What will I need to do?” asked Anthony.
“Nothing at all. Just observe,” said the surgeon.</Text>

            <Title>Scene 48</Title>
            <Synopsis>Roderick and Hargrave manage to get to safety by trapping themselves in a cell.</Synopsis>
            <Text>“In here,” Roderick hissed.
The heavy door swung open with a groan of protest, rusted hinges squealing loudly as Roderick seized the handle and pulled with all his weight. A loud thump—a waif-like figure crashed into the door from the inside. It growled at them, staggered to its feet, and reached its arm through the crack in the door.
Hargrave put a bullet in its skull, viscous blood filling the air with a putrid, festering odor. Roderick slipped through the door, into the dark cell, with Hargrave right behind him. Roderick dragged the body out of the doorway, while Hargrave pulled the door shut, sealing them inside.
The zombies outside howled with frustration and ravenous appetite, slamming their hands against the heavy, iron door. The door had small square slits at eye level, providing them a narrow view of the hall. The zombies thrust their fingers through the gaps and peered through the makeshift window, leering hungrily. Roderick and Hargrave retreated to the back of the cell.
The door could only be opened from the outside. If the dead could figure out how to unlatch the door, there was no way Roderick could stop them. He was banking on their lack of intelligence to keep them alive.
“How many bullets are left in your gun?” Roderick asked.
Hargrave jumped at the sound of Roderick’s voice. His nerves were shot. He was drenched in sweat, his face pale. Even his eyes jumped with nervous energy, flitting from the zombies at the door to the corpse that lay on the floor of the cell, to their bare prison cell.
Roderick’s own nerves were on edge as well. He remembered Hargrave stopping to pull him to his feet. He wouldn’t be alive if not for Hargrave. So he asked the question again, patient and quiet. “How many bullets?”
“I, uh, I don’t know.”
Hargrave flipped open the chamber. He looked gravely at Roderick, fear written plainly on his thickly moustached face. Roderick noticed, for the first time, how handsome he was. Any other time, he thought. Hargrave emptied the gun’s chamber into the palm of his hand. He held out his palm so Roderick could see.
One. Just one bullet.
He loaded it into the chamber, flicked it shut, and handed the gun to Roderick.
“When the time comes,” he said, a thick layer of sweat on his brow, “You mustn’t hesitate.”
Roderick frowned, but he took the gun. A solid Smith &amp; Wesson revolver, with a wooden grip and round barrel. It must have been prison issue. Hargrave must have taken it from one of the prison guards.
“What are you talking about, Hargrave?”
Hargrave said nothing. His eyes were fixed on the door, watching anxiously as the zombies in the hallway beat their hands against it, hissing and snarling like dogs. Roderick followed his gaze. There must have been at least a hundred zombies out there. There was no getting out, at least not that way. They were trapped in here. Even so, Roderick took his eyes from the door, and put a hand on Hargrave’s shoulder.
“We’re going to get out of here,” he said. “Do you know how many people have escaped from Newgate over the years?”
Hagrave shook his head.
“Hundreds,” Roderick told him. “In fact, Jack Sheppard escaped three times. Three times, Hargrave. And we only need to escape the once.”
Hargrave snorted. “I appreciate your optimism, Mr. Steen,” he said. “You’re going to get out of here. Of that I have no doubt. But not me.”
He rolled up his sleeve, showing Roderick his bare arm. Roderick sucked in a breath of alarm. Hargrave’s bicep was marked with a deep gash, a jagged wound of grisled, lacerated flesh. Impossible to tell if the wound had been caused by teeth or jagged fingernails, but it looked hideous. Painful.
But more than that, the wound was clearly infected. Black, gelatinous blood lined the edge of the wound, his skin a deep, necrotic purple. Greenish pus oozed from the wound. A spider-web of rust-colored lines spread from the infected gash. His flesh was a pale cadaverous color, and Roderick noticed that Hargrave had to use his other hand to hold his arm up.
Roderick winced.
“Is it painful?” he asked.
Hargrave’s answer was tinged with regret. “Not at all,” he said. “Truth is, I can’t feel it at all.”
The wound was sickening, a gory mess of ravaged flesh and swollen, oozing infection, but it was Hargrave’s voice that bothered Roderick most. Like the voice of a heavy smoker, his voice was becoming thin and rough, a harsh rasp like shredding paper. The infection was spreading through Hargrave’s body, not just his arm, but his lungs. Decay was working its way through him. Still in its early stages—Hargrave wasn’t a zombie yet—but Roderick guessed he didn’t have long.
“You should have said something earlier,” he said, his voice no more than a whisper.
Hargrave laughed bitterly. “And then what?” he asked. “What could we have done?”
“We could have done something, at least,” Roderick insisted. “We could have amputated. That might have stopped the infection from spreading.”
Hargrave shook his head. “With what equipment? And besides, what use would I have been afterwards?”
He had a point. If Hargrave didn’t die of blood loss from the surgery, he would have been weak, likely unconscious. And Roderick wouldn’t have made it this far without him. In a way, Hargrave had died to get him this far. And now, they would die together. All of Hargrave’s efforts, for nothing.
There was no getting out of this cell, no matter what he’d said about escaping. Jack Sheppard did escape Newgate on three separate occasions, but he hadn’t done it with a hundred of the hungry dead standing outside his door. When Hargrave died, Roderick would have no choice but to put a bullet in his skull. His last bullet.
And then, he would be trapped in his cell, alone, with no chance of escape, no hope of being rescued. He would have only one choice: to waste away in his cell, or to open the door and let the zombies finish him off.
If Roderick was a selfish man, he would have stuck the revolver in his own mouth and blown his brains out before Hargrave had a chance to stop him. But he wasn’t. So he sat on the bench, the only piece of furniture in the room, and aimed the revolver at Hargrave. And waited.</Text>

            <Title>Scene Four</Title>
            <Text>They arrived the next day at the home of a lawyer whose son was badly ill. As a precaution against transferable disease, Dr. Allen wore a mask. Most doctors wouldn’t have bothered; most wouldn’t have been familiar with Henry Lister’s studies of bacteria and the use of antiseptics. But Dr. Allen had always been ahead of his time. He wore an old fashioned plague mask made of worn and faded leather. The doctor’s appearance was honestly frightening when he wore it. But as the door opened, a look of relief passed over the face of the servant who had opened it. His reputation had nothing to do with the mask, and everything to do with his talent for surgery.
“Doctor Allen,” she said. “Thank you so much for coming.”
She stepped aside so he could enter the house, Anthony following in his wake.
The lawyer was sitting on a bench as they entered. He barely looked up at their entrance, but just sat there, staring at the wall, sweat upon his face. The doctor introduced himself and his assistant; his voice was thick and muffled by the heavy leather mask. The man looked up, briefly, and nodded as if to say, thank you for coming.
The servant swept past them.
“This way,” she said, making her way upstairs to the boy’s bedroom. Anthony followed, letting the doctor lead the way.
They paused at the entrance to the bedroom, while the doctor gave Anthony a cloth mask of his own to put on. Then they opened the door to the stench of stale sickness. The doctor opened his kit, while Anthony looked for a corner of the room where he could best avoid getting in the way. He had been here before. Not in this exact room, with this exact boy, nor with this exact doctor. But he had been here all the same, with his father, when he’d been much younger, before his father had tired of his presence. It was oddly comforting to be surrounded by sickness again.
“Will we be able to save him?” he asked quietly.
Looking at the boy in his bed, unconscious, pale and sickly-looking, he doubted it. Doctor Allen, meanwhile, began his examination, not bothering to answer Anthony’s question. Perhaps he hadn’t heard it. Instead, he cataloged the boy’s symptoms aloud as he examined him. He finished by making a diagnosis.
“We’ll need to operate,” said Doctor Allen, who began by instructing his young apprentice to clean the patient’s body in preparation for the surgery. As directed, he applied an iodine solution to the boy’s stomach in preparation for a laparotomy.
“Scalpel,” said the doctor. A moment later, the tool was in his hand.
Anthony seemed to anticipate his every need. At each turn, the tool he required was ready even before he asked for it. Anthony watched with wide eyes as the doctor cut into the boy. When the job was finished, he cleaned up the doctor’s tools, returned them to his kit, and zipped his bag shut.
“Now what?” asked the lawyer’s servant as they made to leave.
“Now we hope for the best,” Doctor Allen replied.
They passed the lawyer on their way out. He hadn’t moved from his seat on the bench by the entrance to his home.</Text>

            <Title>Scene Two</Title>
            <Text>A few moments passed in silence as they sipped their tea, Mr. O defiantly making a show of enjoying his own sour cup.
"Why are you here, Mr. O?" she demanded at last, "What do you want from me?"
Mr. O placed his empty mug on the tea tray. He sat thoughtfully in the chaise longue, looking as comfortable as can be. Finally, not exactly answering her question, he said, "How's business?"
"I beg your pardon?"
"Business," he said again, affecting a tone of genuine curiosity. "How do you enjoy the assassin business? And may I ask, what sort of fee are you charging for your services?"
He glanced about her apartment, obviously noting her modest furnishings, the small size of the room, the lack of a piano and any other upper-class comforts. The inadequacy of her library. The fact that she had no servants and no husband.
She knew that these things did not go unnoticed by her guest, but she also knew that she could afford them, if she wanted them. Well, perhaps not a husband. But still. She had no great need of money. Mostly, she did what she did for the thrill of it, and because she was very good at her job. The money was…well, it didn't hurt that she could earn more in one night than most men made in their entire lives. But she didn't need it, and she couldn't afford to spend much of it.
"It takes a toll, does it not?" said Mr. O, interrupting her thoughts.
"I'm sorry?" she said, snapping out of her reverie.
"It takes a toll on your conscience," he said. "The killing, I mean. The thieving isn’t so bad, I’m sure, but you don’t strike me as a killer. It must be difficult for you.”
“My conscience?” she said. “I’m not sure I have one of those. Must have been absent when they were handing them out. And besides, as I told you, I’m not an assassin; I'm a thief."
"Right," he said, as if he had just remembered this point. "Of course," he said, "You're not an assassin. But then sometimes, you do kill people, if you're asked to."
“Most of them deserve it,” she said bitterly.
“And if the price is right, so much the better” he pressed.
She did not have to defend herself to this man she hardly knew. Who was he to judge? She should have just sent him on his way when he'd shown up at her door.
She glared fiercely at him. The intensity of her gaze was often enough to make men recoil, but Mr. O seemed to take no notice of her anger. Or rather he was quite adept at ignoring it.
“You think I’m in this business for the money?” she asked, incredulous. She gestured around her apartment.
“No. But it does take a toll, does it not, Miss Monday?" he persisted. “Truly, I don't wish to cause you any offense, but you don’t really expect me to believe that you feel proud of the work you do.”
“Proud?” she said, considering it. “No, not proud, exactly,” she admitted. “Then again, I suppose, sometimes I do feel something a bit like pride,” she said, thinking back to when she was a little girl, stealing only to survive. Taking money from the pockets of rich men when they weren’t looking, and only after she’d begged them for a penny so she could buy something to eat. The poor were starving in London while the rich grew ever richer. And fatter. And did nothing. “The gentlemen I’ve stolen from, Mr. O, are sufficiently rich that they hardly notice the absence of what I’ve stolen. I give most of my profits to the poor. And you think I should feel guilty?”
“Yes, I see,” said Mr. O, unconvincingly. He took a sip of tea, and grimaced. “You’re a modern day Robin Hood. But why not apply your skills to something just slightly less criminal?”
Her glare softened, if only slightly.
"I enjoy my work, Mister O,” she said, “And I’m very good at it.”
The implied threat was clear. Still, he managed to ignore it.
“That you are good at your job, I do not doubt,” he said. “But I don’t believe you enjoy your work. You merely enjoy the distraction it provides. You excel as a thief simply because you bore easily. But that’s not enough to assuage your guilt.”
“Guilt shmilt,” she said. “More tea?" she asked in the tone of voice she ordinarily reserved for men she intended to shoot dead.
“No,” he replied, obviously uninterested in the sort of tea she had on offer. “I can offer you a much better distraction than the one your current occupation provides. I can’t promise it will be any less dangerous, however.”
She raised an eyebrow, suddenly curious, despite of her annoyance at his unrelenting arrogance.
"I won't lie, Miss Monday. I was annoyed that you would leave me to deal with our dearly departed Lord Connor without your assistance," he said. He paused, as if he was expecting her to apologize. When she didn't, he added, "But I was also impressed."
She straightened in her chair.
"You demonstrated resourcefulness in surviving Lord Connor's attack, and resilience in recovering from it. You showed cunning, in deceiving me, and in devising an escape plan. You possess an incredibly unique skillset that I believe could be quite useful, if those skills could be employed for something more beneficial than stealing watches and taking lives."
Another whir of pistons and gears as she rolled her eyes again.
“Watches, Mr. O?" she said, "I'm not a pickpocket.”
“God Almighty, woman, can’t you take a compliment?”
“Not if it comes laden with insults.”
“Whatever it is that you steal is of little interest to me," he said. "My point is that I'm not your enemy.”
"Then what are you?" she said, pouring him another cup of tea, though he hadn't asked for one. She set out a few slices of lemon, but left him to squeeze them in his cup on his own this time.
“Your prospective employer.”
She laughed. So there it was. “So that's what this is about? You want to hire me?"
He nodded.
“To do what?" she asked, “Do the monsters you hunt keep a stash of valuable ancient artefacts you need me to steal? Or did you make up that monster hunter nonsense?”
He shook his head. "I only wish that aspect of my life were a lie. You saw Lord Connor with your own eyes. You ought to know it isn’t nonsense,” he said.
“I saw him,” she admitted, and her skin prickled with the recollection. “But I don’t believe in monsters, Mister O. Lord Connor was dreadfully sick. That is all.”
He shrugged, as if to say that he did not believe her but that he didn’t wish to argue either.
“Really?” he said at last.
“What else am I supposed to believe?” she asked.
He shrugged again. “Whatever you believe, I don't wish to hire you as a thief. As I said before, thievery is not your only skill.”
She shook her head. “So what is it that you want me to do? You want me to come work for you killing these monstrous abominations that ought already to be dead. Am I understanding that correctly?"
“For a woman, you'd be quite good at it,” he assured her.
"That's not the problem," she said, exasperated. “Also, for a woman?”
“Yes,” he said. “And what is the problem?”
“Let us pretend, for a moment, that these creatures, these monsters as you call them, are as you say. Monsters, and not merely men with a dreadful affliction. How do they come into being?” she said, preferring to ask another question of her own than to answer his. “Lord Connor, for example, what happened to him?”
The look in Mister O’s eyes slowly changed from that expression of smug indifference to one of sympathy, as he contemplated the question.
“That’s a question we’ve gone to great lengths to investigate. We’re not entirely sure what causes it, but we do know what causes it to spread,” he began. “Ordinarily, these creatures seek out the living; their bite is…infectious, for lack of a better word. Typically, if you should find one of these beings, you can be sure that others are nearby. Naturally, once they have been put down, you can generally expect to find bite marks somewhere on their bodies.”
She nodded to show she was following him so far. “So that’s what happened to Connor?” she asked.
“No,” said Mister O.
“What?” she said, startled.
“Our quartermaster is still examining Lord Connor’s body,” said Mr. O, “But so far, we have been unable to ascertain the cause of Lord Connor’s resurrection.”
“Which means what?” said Miss Monday, still somewhat stunned by this revelation.
“I’m not sure,” said Mister O, “But I do have some theories. I believe Lord Connor was created deliberately.”
“Why would anybody create such a monster on purpose?”
“In order to kill you,” Mr. O replied.
If he’d meant to shock her, he’d succeeded. She stared at him, utterly speechless, as she contemplated his speculation. If Connor’s monstrosity was deliberately caused by someone who wanted her dead, who could it be? Truth be told, she had no shortage of people who wanted to kill her, but surely there were easier, cleaner ways of killing someone, even if that someone is a highly trained assassin. No, Mr. O had to be wrong about this.
“Are there a lot of these creatures?" she asked, at last, shifting the topic of conversation just slightly.
"More than you'd think,” he said.
"Then why…” she began, not quite sure how to phrase the question. “Why don’t the newspapers report their nefarious activities? Why are there no societies dedicated to educating the citizens of London on the defence against these monstrous beasts?” she said finally. “Should they not be public knowledge?”
"No," he said simply.
"How do you manage to keep them secret?” she wanted to know.
"That's part of our job as well.”
"To keep people in the dark?" she asked.
"For their own protection," he said, taken aback by the accusation in her voice.
She snorted dismissively. "Mr. O, I thank you sincerely for this surprise visit. It has been most illuminating. Now, I'll thank you again for seeing yourself out."
He stood up, somewhat deflated, from the chaise longue, and replaced his hat upon his head. He thanked her for the tea, and headed for the door.
“Miss Monday,” he said when he was at the door, “I feel it is my duty to let you know that your life is in danger.”
“My life is danger, Mr. O. Truly, your concern is touching. But I assure you, I can handle myself.”
He sighed with a subtle shrug of his shoulders. This time, she couldn’t help but finding the gesture irritating, rather than charming.
“Should you change your mind," he said, placing his card upon the credenza, "Feel free to call upon me at any time.”
She slammed the door shut when he left. She leaned back against the door and listened to his footsteps as he departed.</Text>

            <Text>Interrupting their conversation, the Captain’s voice came through the speaking tubes, tinny and distorted through the pipes. And uncustomarily panicked. “Brace yourselves!” he cried.
Then the ship turned on its side, and there was an explosion of sound. A deathly wail. Miss Monday was airborne, only for a moment. Then she hit something hard, and there was the taste of blood in her mouth. The smell of smoke. The ship was on fire.
There was no time to think about what that meant. The ship was still spinning, Miss Monday still grasping for something to hold onto. Anything that was not affixed to the floor was sliding across it, Miss Monday included. But even as she fought to remain conscious and grasped for a handhold, the smell of smoke and the chilling wail of the creature they had almost certainly already killed, struck her as somehow important.
“Perhaps I spoke too soon,” said Mr. O. “I believe they may be trying to kill us after all.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene 18</Title>
            <Text>Jonathan stepped out into the rain. He had no umbrella to unfurl, as he hadn’t been expecting rain when he’d headed out. Of course, in London, he should have been constantly prepared for inclement weather. He scanned the sky for his ride home, but it was difficult to see in the rain and darkness. He thought he saw a light flickering from above, its light refracted by the falling raindrops and the mist rising off the cobbles. It might have been the Penny Dreadful’s lanterns, but he wasn’t sure. He supposed he could always hire a carriage, but he figured he’d try signaling the ship first. Although the crew was expecting a night off, the captain had told him to send a signal if the airship was needed after all. With this weather, though, Jonathan didn’t know how visible the flare would be. If the ship was circling nearby somewhere, the crew might happen to see it; otherwise, they might not.
He made his way to the gate and pushed it open, hoping for a clearer view from the street. Jonathan could barely see his own two feet as the rain began to fall in earnest.
Before he had a chance to fire the flare, a deep, low voice resonated through the fog from behind him.
“Mr. Grimmer.”
It was Henry Charles Ocelot. Jonathan spun around to face him and was surprised to see the man’s face so close to his own.
“Mr. Ocelot,” said Jonathan, having to speak up to be heard against the noise of falling rain and crashing thunder.
“Sorry if I startled you, Mr. Grimmer,” the large man replied.
“Shouldn’t you be seeing to your employer?” Jonathan asked, unsettled by the large man’s presence.
“This will only take a moment,” he said, opening an umbrella. He gestured for Jonathan to take it. Jonathan accepted it, though his gratitude was tempered with suspicion. “I saw that you were concerned about the people in Mr. Sinews’ den. You seem like a good man, Mr. Grimmer. But don’t concern yourself over their fates.”
Jonathan looked up at him, swallowing a knot that was forming in his throat. “Are you threatening me, Mr. Ocelot?” he asked, more timidly than he’d intended.
To his surprise, Ocelot let out a laugh. He grinned, and it was a surprisingly warm smile. Jonathan had always been good at reading people; perhaps this was something that had passed on to him from his father. But he was starting to wonder if he’d misread Henry Charles Ocelot. He stared at the man curiously.
“No, Mr. Grimmer. I’m not threatening you. I’m only trying to tell you that you may have gotten the wrong impression of my employer. Things, with him, are not quite what they seem.”
Jonathan shook his head. He could see that Ocelot truly believed that. He saw only the best of Sinews’ qualities. To Mr. Sinews’ credit, he was undeniably intelligent, and he had been more than willing to help Jonathan, which Jonathan did appreciate. But that didn’t mean Sinews was a good man.
“I think that things are exactly as they seem, Mr. Ocelot. I can see why you would want to defend him. He was very helpful, however. I am not ungrateful. As a measure of my appreciation, I won’t look into Mr. Sinews’ opium den. I have more pressing matters on my plate as it is.”
Ocelot said nothing, but Jonathan could see that he was deep in thought. After a while, the rain beginning to soak through his coat, he continued.
“Think what you will of Mr. Sinews,” he said. “My employer may be a great resource to you,” he said. “I wasn’t threatening you. I was offering you his services. If you wish to call upon Mr. Sinews again, you are welcome to do so. He may continue to be useful to you. He is obsessive, utterly addicted to the grotesqueness of the Resurrectionists’s activities, Anthony Tidkins in particular. He followed the Ripper case with similar interest. The case of Dr. Palmer. Burke and Hare.”
Jonathan blinked at that. How could Sinews have followed the Burke and Hare case? It was well before his time. That would have put Sinews at over seventy years of age.
“He has a difficult personality, I know,” Ocelot continued, heedless of Jonathan’s confusion. “To say that he has unsavory interests could be considered a vast understatement. I have known him for many years, however. You can trust him.”
Jonathan remained unconvinced.
“How do I know I can trust you, Mr. Ocelot?”
“What do your instincts tell you?” Mr. Ocelot asked him.
Jonathan had to admit, there was something about Ocelot’s warm demeanor that made him want to trust the man, though his appearance was frightening, and his association with Parson Sinews was damning.
“When your world is crumbling around you, you should trust your own instincts. But if you really want my advice, Mr. Grimmer…” Ocelot trailed off. He was looking in the opposite direction.
“Yes?”
“Someone’s coming,” he said. “Quickly.”
Ocelot grabbed Jonathan’s arm, and roughly dragged him from the sidewalk to the adjacent alleyway. They hid beneath a tall tree, and Jonathan watched in breathless silence as a procession of black carriages drove into sight and rolled to a stop in front of the house. The passengers began to climb out of the carts, wearing bobby hats and brandishing truncheons. They surrounded the house just as its front door opened.
“What’s going on?” Jonathan whispered.
They must have been looking for him, he thought. They probably wanted to question him about the events at Lord Connor’s masquerade. How had they found him here? It didn’t even occur to him that Roderick might have given the police his whereabouts. Perhaps they’d spotted the Penny Dreadful and followed it. He scanned the sky again for any sign of it, but still couldn’t see it.
“Quiet,” Ocelot whispered back.
“Mr. Sinews,” they heard the police officer call. “Or do you prefer your alias? Anthony Tidkins.”
Jonathan’s heart pounded, worried the police would spot them despite their hiding spot. At least the police weren’t here for him.
He couldn’t make out Sinews’ reply from where he stood. Thunder continued to crash, and rain hammered down on the cobblestone, as cacophonous as a rushing river.
“You are under arrest for the murder of Lord Henry Connor,” said the police officer loudly. His voice resonated, even against the noise of the storm.
Jonathan watched in stunned silence as the policemen surrounded Parson Sinews, drawing their guns and aiming them at Sinews.</Text>
            <Comments>When did Jonathan tell the Penny Dreadful's captain where he'd be? 
 He had intentionally not taken the airship to Parson Sinew's house, 
but, instead, took a fly…
(removed: decided not to stray too far from Mr. Sinews’ house in the hopes that the ship would spot him. The ship was armed with binoculars, after all, and therefore had a better chance of spotting him if he remained where he said he’d be)
Oooo, interesting!</Comments>

            <Title>Scene Five</Title>
            <Text>Anthony was bored. Again. The doctor had arranged for him to sit in on the anatomy classes at the university. At first, he was thrilled, though he suspected the arrangement was just the doctor’s way of getting rid of him. He shouldn’t have asked so many questions. He knew that. He just couldn’t help himself. There were so many things that he wanted to know. The university satisfied that desire, or at least, it had. But he was beginning to find that the instructor tended to ramble on at length, without really saying anything new.
Occasionally, the university would arrange to have cadavers brought in, and the professor would perform dissections. These days were the worst, not because Anthony found the dissections distasteful, but because the class size would swell and the students would crowd around the demonstration so that Anthony would be unable to see anything worthwhile. The dissections merely reminded him of what he was missing. Assisting with the doctor’s surgical procedures was much more satisfying; at least then there was the possibility of saving the life of the patient. With the dissections, there was only death.
Today though, there was no cadaver to be dissected. Just another boring lecture Anthony had heard a dozen times before. I could honestly teach this class myself, he thought. And if he could lecture as capably as the university’s professor…
Why shouldn’t I be practicing surgery myself, he wondered.
He’d read all the books. He’d seen it done often enough, by both his father and his tutor. And now he’d sat in the lecture halls and heard all the lectures until they’d become tedious.
Quietly, he got out of his seat. He was sitting in the back row, at the far left, so it was easy enough to pack up his books and slip out of the class without disrupting the professor, who was going on at length about the disputed merits of bloodletting.
He slipped out of the lecture hall. He unfolded his parasol as he stepped out into the promenade. The day was hot and sunny, rife with possibilities. Anthony was excited by his idea. He was walking quickly now, making his way through the streets he’d come to know so well. There was a little shop near the university, which catered to students of the university.
He had a little money in his pocket. His father hadn’t sent him to America to be poor. He fished the coins out of his pocket, and counted them as he walked. There was the shop. A sign in the window reassured him that it was open. He pushed the door open with a chime of jangling bells.
A man appeared behind the counter to greet him. He looked curiously at Anthony, frowning a little.
“Good day, sir,” he said, speaking as eloquently as possible so as to reassure the shopkeeper.
“How can I help you?” the man said gruffly. If he was surprised by Anthony’s English accent, he gave no indication.
“I am a medical student at the university and apprenticed to a prominent surgeon. I require my own equipment.”
The man sighed. “A bit young for a university student, aren’t you?” he asked.
“I suppose so, sir,” Anthony admitted. He waited patiently. The man would either sell him the equipment, or he wouldn’t. There was no use attempting to argue with him.
“Alright then,” he said at last. The man made his way from behind the counter to where he kept the supplies for the medical students. “You need books?”
Anthony shook his head. “No, sir. I’ve got those already.”
The shopkeeper nodded. He grabbed a few things off the shelf and loaded them into Anthony’s arms, listing the items and the prices respectively as he placed each tool into Anthony’s hand. Surgical bag. Scalpel. Forceps. Bone saw. When he was finished, Anthony’s hands were full, but his face was lit up with excitement. He brought his equipment to the counter, and the man called for his assistant to come and help him load the tools into the bag.
“Anything else I can help you with?” he asked.
Anthony did a quick mental calculation of the price of the tools. He counted his coins again, and determined that he had more than enough to pay for everything. “There is one more thing,” he said.
The man raised an eyebrow.
“I need an advertisement placed in the classifieds,” he said.
“Ah,” said the shopkeeper. Again, he called for his assistant, a boy about Anthony’s own age. “Write it down,” he said, “Jim here will see that it gets to the papers.”
Anthony smiled, delighted. This was all going surprisingly easily. “Thank you, sir,” he said. Then he picked up his pen, scrawled down the message, and pushed it across the counter. He placed his coins down beside it, and the shopkeeper’s eyes lit up as bright as Anthony’s.
“Anything for my favourite customer,” he said.
Anthony grinned, and turned to follow Jim out of the store. He paused at the doorway. “You wouldn’t happen to know where I might buy a plague doctor’s mask, would you?”
The shopkeeper frowned. “What do you need that for?” he asked, all the good will gone from his voice. Anthony produced another coin from his pocket, let it roll between his fingers, and watched the shopkeeper’s eyes follow it as he returned it to his palm. He placed the coin on the counter.
“I know a leather-crafter,” said the shopeeper. “It’s an unusual request, is all.”
Anthony had to agree. It was a bit unusual, but he felt that the mask was important if he was to be taken seriously. Dr. Allen’s patients hadn’t hesitated to hire the man in the mask. They’d wanted a doctor. They didn’t care that he wore an old-fashioned, creepy-looking mask. And they’d been desperate enough not to ask questions. But they might not have been so eager to hire a boy of Anthony’s age, nor, for that matter, an albino.
In short, he felt that people would generally be more comfortable with a man with a mask than a boy without one.</Text>
            <Notes>- Establish Jack's mechanical tinkering earlier. Have him attend an operating theatre? Have him help with a dissection. Make Dr. Allen more like John Hunter: He should live in and run a medical school, have preparations in jars, be willing to experiment/question established practices/trust only his own eyes, dislike reading, army surgeon - called away for duty?</Notes>

            <Title>Writeup</Title>
            <Text>It’s London. The year is 1887. And the dead are beginning to rise.
When Jonathan Grimmer uncovers evidence that Lord Henry Connor may be a member of the Resurrectionists, a secret society whose scientific pursuits defy ethics, laws, and the natural order of the universe, he finds himself dragged into a world of subterfuge, conspiracy, and well, zombies. His only allies are criminals and reprobates. Take Annabel Grey for example. Thief, assassin, and part machine. Or there’s Parson Sinews, criminal by association, vampire by reputation, and an aficionado on the subject of murder.

Meanwhile, his only weapon in the battle against the Resurrectionists and the plague of walking corpses is the airship Penny Dreadful. At the centre of it all is the mysterious Dr. Allen, whose gruesome series of murders once brought the Resurrectionists into the spotlight before he faded into obscurity.  Only recently, he’s started killing again.

Dead London is a full length novel, a steampunk zombie-infested adventure at 85,000 words. Better still, it's already fully written. But I do still need your help to self-publish this book. All money raised for this project will be put towards professional editing and formatting services.

            <Title>Scene Two</Title>
            <Text>It seemed to Jonathan that so far his attempts at solving the mystery of the Resurrectionists had been comprised of going from one unreliable source to another. It had begun with Miss Monday, who was at worst an assassin and at best a thief, and whom he inexplicably trusted most of all, though it was obvious she was keeping things from him. Then there was Parson Sinews, a criminal by association if nothing else, and a murder enthusiast. He’d had plenty of dirt on the Resurrectionists, but it was coloured by fanciful theories, not to mention he was fixated on Dr. Allen. Henry Ocelot, the owner of several opium dens and bawdy houses, who again seemed inexplicably trustworthy in spite of his reputation. Of course, even if Jonathan were willing to put his faith in that man, he had no idea where to find him; his calling card had been utterly destroyed by the rain. Perhaps Miss Monday would know where to find him, given her knowledge of the criminal network. Then Dr. Simms, literally a mad scientist and a member of the Resurrectionists. Perhaps he’d once been loyal to Jonathan’s father, but there was every chance that his opium-addled mind had been further influenced by the notorious serum of Anthony Tidkins' invention. Dr. Allen, a frail old man whose alleged murder spree had made him an urban legend, a bogey man. Again, nothing that man had to say could be taken at face value. And then there was Mrs. Grimmer. Jonathan’s own mother, whom he’d twice overheard fraternizing with the enemy, and who had shot him with a tranquilizer. Finally, Manuel, the family butler, who had urged him to trust Mrs. Grimmer, and claimed that she was still loyal to Jonathan’s father’s Agency, and was working undercover to dismantle the Resurrectionists’ plans. After all this, and given that in the last two days he’d hardly slept a wink—unless you counted the time that he was out cold—Jonathan was more confused than ever.
It was thus with aggravation, rather than his customary nonchalance, that Jonathan made the acquaintance of Abraham Palmer.
“Mr. O,” he introduced himself, though it was painfully obvious that Mr. Palmer already knew who Jonathan was.
Still, while Jonathan was feeling inhospitable, he’d been raised in polite society. He gestured to an empty chair and invited Mr. Palmer and Miss Monday to take tea with him. At least if he was to interrogate the poor man, he would do so politely. Over tea.
“I am given to understand that you received a copy of the letter,” said Mr. Palmer.
Jonathan started. “What letter?” he blurted, only making it more obvious that he did indeed have a copy of it.
Mr. Palmer produced his own, and showed it to Jonathan. It was identical to Jonathan’s copy. Handwritten, authentic insofar as he could tell, and signed by Queen Victoria. He turned to Miss Monday.
“I take it you are apprised of the situation as well then?”
“I believe I know the gist,” she said, gulping back her tea as if it was the last cup on earth. “It’s been a long day,” she said with a dismissive shrug, “I find tea to be quite the restorative, don’t you?” She changed the subject. “Mr. Palmer came to my assistance following the incident at Dr. Allen’s. I cannot say that I trust him entirely,” she continued, looking directly at Mr. Palmer as she said this, “But he did save my life. And he claims loyalty to your father’s cause.”
“But he’s a Resurrectionist?” said Jonathan. The man still had his plague doctor’s mask, though he didn’t wear it on his face, but carried about him.
“I was an Agent,” said Mr. Palmer. “I worked with your father. After his death, your mother and I agreed to continue his work. Shortly thereafter, the Resurrectionists began their hostile takeover. They already had members within the Agency; when they started to drug the rest of us, it wasn’t long before they’d taken over.”
“How is it possible that you managed to avoid the drug?” Jonathan asked.
Palmer shrugged. “They slipped it into the tea,” he said.
“Ah,” said Jonathan. “You mean to say that as an American, you don’t partake in that very British pastime.”
“I’m big on coffee,” he said.
“Alas, I have none on offer.” Jonathan looked the man in the eyes, trying to read him. Like Miss Monday, Jonathan couldn’t say that he trusted the man entirely, but there were elements of truth to his story. And what’s more, he actually liked the gentleman, which was more than he could say for Parson Sinews, Dr. Allen, or—dare he say it—Mrs. Grimmer.
There was a casualness to his manners, a slouch to his posture, a shrug to his gestures, that made him quickly relatable to Jonathan, who’d spent much of his life being lectured on manners—and then immediately forgetting them.
And if he could be trusted, Abraham Palmer could be a useful ally. Putting his interest in saving London from a plague of the undead above polite conversation, Jonathan leaned forward, putting his hand on Mr. Palmer’ wrist as if to impress upon him the seriousness of the question he wanted to ask.
Jonathan had many questions. It was difficult to know which one to ask first. Who killed Lord Connor, and why? Why was Parson Sinews blamed for Lord Connor’s death, and what have the Resurrectionists done with him? If Lord Connor was himself a Resurrectionist, why did they target him? Why did they unleash the Lazarus Virus at the masquerade? What was Miss Monday hired to steal from him?
But the question he settled on was this. “What are the Resurrectionists planning?” He indicated the letter that he and Palmer both had copies of. “It’s more than just this, isn’t it?” he said.
Mr. Palmer looked from Jonathan to Miss Monday, and back again. Still not drinking his tea, he replied. “Thing is,” he said, “You’re thinking about the Resurrectionists all wrong. Like they have just one collective goal. That’s not it at all. Dr. Simms, for example, studied aeronautics. The Penny Dreadful was his design. Dr. Allen was a surgeon, although he later made intensive studies in biology, with a particular interest in genetics. Anthony Tidkins had broader interests. After studying surgery under Dr. Allen’s tutelage, he made a study of corvine birds, then later turned to pharmacology.”
“The serum,” said Jonathan.
Palmer nodded.
“Throughout all this, he also took an interest in engineering.”
“Bit of a jack of all trades,” Miss Monday said.
“And finally, he began his study of the Lazarus Virus,” Mr. Palmer continued. “If you want to know what the Resurrectionists are planning, you need to know what Anthony Tidkins is planning. And nobody knows that, except for him. All other scientific pursuits have been abandoned but Anthony’s, thanks to the serum.”
Jonathan turned to Miss Monday, who was drinking her tea more calmly now, her brow creased pensively. “Penny for your thoughts?”
She blinked in surprise. “Sorry?” she said, as if she’d just woken from a dream. “Oh, right.” She set her tea down on the side table. “I was just thinking, Dr. Simms said that Dr. Allen’s work was inconsequential, that he was no murderer; it was all Anthony.”
Jonathan nodded. “You don't believe that to be true?”
“Do you?” she replied.
“After meeting Dr. Allen, it seemed difficult to believe that a frail old man could be capable of such heinous acts, but now, I’m not so sure. Dr. Simms might have simply been repeating what he was told to repeat.” He turned to Mr. Palmer for confirmation.
The man shrugged. “Not too sure,” he said, “But Dr. Allen’s work was hardly inconsequential.”
Miss Monday, setting aside her tea, took a key from around her neck. “Would you excuse me a moment, gentlemen?” she asked, getting out of her seat. “Clockwork parts to wind,” she explained.
She crossed the large room, found herself a table and a mirror, far enough from Jonathan and Mr. Palmer that she could wind up her gears without interrupting their tea, but close enough that she could still follow the conversation.
“What exactly was Dr. Allen studying?” Jonathan asked. “You and Dr. Simms both mentioned genetics.”
“Difficult to say for sure. As he was Anthony’s mentor, their studies often overlapped. They both made studies of prosthetics, grafting machinery to living tissue. Which is why Dr. Allen could easily have been blamed if it really was Anthony that committed all those murders. Later, the two parted, as Dr. Allen took on a military contract, which is when he began his intensive studies of genetics, while Anthony Tidkins began to study the Lazarus Virus. As far as I know, Dr. Allen was interested in metamorphosis.”
“Metamorphosis?” said Miss Monday, from across the room.
“Transformation, in layman’s terms.”
“That reminds me,” said Jonathan. He got out of his chair. “We’d best get moving. We’ll continue this conversation later, shall we? I’ll alert the Captain that it’s time to take off.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene 50</Title>
            <Text>How long had it been since Annabel had seen Anthony Tidkins? There was still a part of her that wanted to run towards him, even now, and put her arms around him. There was another part of her that wanted to put her arms around his throat. That’s family for you though, isn’t it, she thought.
When Annabel first met Anthony Tidkins, she had been fascinated by him, walking through the streets of London with a parasol above his head. She’d never seen a gentleman with a parasol before, that feminine accessory more regularly used by ladies. His was of a distinctly more masculine design, if such a thing were possible, but it wasn’t the parasol that gave her pause. It was the paleness of his skin, so white she felt that if she squinted she might actually be able to look through him. His eyes were a soft pink color, his eyelashes long but white as snow. His hair was that wintry white as well, and his body waif-like, thin. Aside from the parasol, he was dressed to the height of fashion, immaculately dressed in dark but rich tones of grey and blue.
He wasn’t considerably older than she was, perhaps fifteen, sixteen maybe, while she was nearing nine. He was a gentleman, however, and she was an urchin. She began following him, at first out of mere curiosity. Then as she continued to thread her way through the marketplace, following his footsteps, it occurred to her that he must be absurdly wealthy.
Annabel, with her plain and tattered skirt, brown fingerless gloves and hair knotted and messy, was keenly aware of her own social status, as she tailed the wealthy young man. She couldn’t imagine what he was doing in the Old Nichol in Bethnal Green, a bleak neighbourhood consisting of ramshackle tenement buildings, a labyrinth of filth-ridden streets, the home of the downtrodden. Here, Annabel knew girls only a little older than her—some her own age—who had already turned to that other, less dignified form of employment that girls of her social status often turned to, for money. In a few years, she might be forced to consider that herself. She had only one thing that would keep her from suffering that indignity. Sticky fingers.
She followed him from the Old Nichol all the way to the Columbia Market, where it was Annabel and not the albino that was out of place. There, she paused to watch him purchase a newspaper, and paid close attention to which pocket housed his coin purse. She followed him a little longer, waiting for the right moment. A horse was milling nearby, its cabriolet parked on the side of the road beside a haberdashery.
As the albino stopped beside the horse to look at some item on display in the shop window, Annabel settled on her game. The horse dodge. Without warning, she violently slapped the brim of his hat, causing the hat to fall over his eyes. While he was busy reclaiming his vision, Annabel was slipping her little fingers into his pocket. She closed them around the pouch and swiftly lifted it from the albino’s pocket. If all had gone according to plan, she’d have dodged beneath the legs of the horse and been out of sight before he’d righted his hat.
Instead, the pouch caught on something. A chain dangled between pocket and purse. The chain pulled, and the albino quickly extricated his hat from his eyes. But Annabel was not to be deterred. A knife flicked out of her pocket. Deftly, she sliced open the gentleman’s jacket, taking pocket, chain, and purse and all. Before he could react, Annabel slipped the purse into her own pocket and pointed the knife at the older boy, warning him not to try anything.
Then she was off, dodging beneath the legs of the horse. The game usually went more smoothly than this. This time, she was forced to flee, back into the crowd of the marketplace. She dove beneath vendors’ carts and weaved through a sea of pedestrian traffic. The city was her playground, and she’d played this game before. She never lost. The trick was that she was always the first to start running.
This time was no different, except in one regard; the albino hadn’t even bothered to chase after her. He simply smiled as he watched her flee. When Annabel realized that he wasn’t about to continue chasing her, she opened her palm in order to examine her prize. Her eyes grew big and bright. Such a score! What she held in her tiny palm was more than a year’s salary for a man of modest income.</Text>
            <Comments>being twice her age would have been a big difference to and 8 yr old, and reference to an eight year old not being a prostitute only because she has sticky fingers seems wrong, if you want to use that, she should be at least twelve or thirteen (says he who has his core female character being sold to her father's mates from when she was eleven, but then he was a bastard)</Comments>

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>The tank was filled to the top with dark, murky water, completely sealed to prevent the creature within from escaping. Pressed against the glass was a set of lifeless, rotten fingers.
The skin on those rough hands had begun to slough off and reveal its yellowed metacarpals. The creature’s naked, sinewy flesh had slowly begun to rot and fall away, filling the tank with drifting bits of rotten meat, like a macabre snow globe. Within a ribcage bare of flesh, was a heart turned black and gray by rot. Un-beating.
But it was the creature’s face which truly filled Miss Monday with unshakeable terror, and from which she could not tear away her gaze.
Its jaws, still gnashing, its yellowing teeth—most of which now lay on the floor of the tank—grinding against the glass walls as if to gnaw its way free, the creature stared at Miss Monday through the glass.
She could see her own face, reflected in the glass, and knew that her expression was one of utter horror. But still, she stepped closer to the tank, looking in amazement and repulsion at the once-human thing that swam within the confines of its glass prison.
Its nose, rotten so thoroughly that Miss Monday could see the wretched creature’s skull through its nostrils. Its ears, tattered and torn like scraps of old cloth. And its eyes, its dreadful eyes. White and lifeless, unblinking, as the creature moved its head to stare alternately at Mr. O and Miss Monday.
“An experiment?” she repeated, horrified, but managing to keep her voice calm.
“We wanted to see if they could breathe underwater,” he explained.
“And?”
“And it turns out they don’t need to breathe,” he said.
She stepped back as the thing inside the tank moved its head and looked at her, unblinking.
“These creatures are dead, Miss Monday,” said Mr. O. The way he said it, it sounded almost like an apology. “I wasn’t lying when I told you I hunt monsters.”
She shook her head in disgust as she forced herself to look away from the hideous creature in the tank, which had once been a man. It was pitiable, really, but she could not bring herself to feel pity. All she could feel, even as she turned away to stare at the bare wall on the other side of the room, shivering, was dread.</Text>

Penny dreadful
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
For other uses, see Penny dreadful (disambiguation).

Black Bess; or, The knight of the road. A romanticized tale of Dick Turpin – a popular subject in fiction.
A penny dreadful (also called penny horrible, penny awful,[1] penny number, and penny blood[n 1]) was a type of British fiction publication in the 19th century that usually featured lurid serial stories appearing in parts over a number of weeks, each part costing one (old) penny. The term, however, soon came to encompass a variety of publications that featured cheap sensational fiction, such as story papers and booklet "libraries". The penny dreadfuls were printed on cheap pulp paper and were aimed at young working class males.[3]

Victorian Britain experienced social changes that resulted in increased literacy rates. With the rise of capitalism and industrialisation, people began to spend more money on entertainment, contributing to the popularisation of the novel. Improvements in printing resulted in newspapers such as Joseph Addison’s The Spectator and Richard Steele’s The Tatler, and England's more fully recognizing the singular concept of reading as a form of leisure; it was, of itself, a new industry. Other significant changes included industrialization and an increased capacity for travel via the invention of tracks, engines, and the corresponding railway distribution.

In accordance with these changes, the demand for literature in the mid-nineteenth century intensified dramatically. The penny dreadfuls, named for both their cheap nature, and poor, sensational quality, erupted into existence and met the desires of the poor class. The penny dreadfuls “became by far the most alluring and low-priced form of escapist reading available to ordinary youth, until the advent in the early 1890s of future newspaper magnate Alfred Harmsworth’s price-cutting ‘halfpenny dreadfuller’ (Springhall 568).” The term "dreadful" was originally assumed to express societal anxiety or moral alarm over the new profitable innovation directed at the youth.[citation needed] In reality, the serial novels were overdramatic and sensational, but generally harmless. If anything, the penny dreadfuls, although obviously not the most enlightening or inspiring of literary selections, resulted in increasingly literate youth in the Industrial period. The wide circulation of this sensationalist literature, however, contributed to an ever greater fear of crime in mid-Victorian Britain.[4]

These serials started in the 1830s, originally as a cheaper alternative to mainstream fictional part-works, such as those by Charles Dickens (which cost a shilling [twelve pennies]) for young working class males. The stories themselves were reprints, or sometimes rewrites, of Gothic thrillers such as The Monk or The Castle of Otranto, as well as new stories about famous criminals. Some of the most famous of these penny part-stories were The String of Pearls: A Romance (introducing Sweeney Todd), The Mysteries of London (inspired by the French serial The Mysteries of Paris), and Varney the Vampire. Highwaymen were popular heroes; Black Bess or the Knight of the Road, outlining the largely imaginary exploits of real-life English highwayman Dick Turpin, continued for 254 episodes.

Working class boys who could not afford a penny a week often formed clubs that would share the cost, passing the flimsy booklets from reader to reader. Other enterprising youngsters would collect a number of consecutive parts, then rent the volume out to friends.

In 1866, Boys of England was introduced as a new type of publication, an eight-page magazine that featured serial stories as well as articles and shorts of interest. It was printed on the same cheap paper, though it sported a larger format than the penny parts.

Numerous competitors quickly followed, with such titles as Boys' Leisure Hour, Boys' Standard, Young Men of Great Britain, etc. As the price and quality of other types of fiction works were the same, these also fell under the general definition of penny dreadfuls.

American dime novels were edited and rewritten for a British audience. These appeared in booklet form, such as the Boy's First Rate Pocket Library. Frank Reade, Buffalo Bill, and Deadwood Dick were all popular with the penny dreadful audience.

In late 1893, a publisher, Alfred Harmsworth, decided to do something about what was widely perceived as the corrupting influence of the penny dreadfuls.[citation needed] He issued new story papers, The Half-penny Marvel, The Union Jack, and Pluck, all priced at one half-penny. At first the stories were high-minded moral tales, reportedly based on true experiences, but it was not long before these papers started using the same kind of material as the publications they competed against. A.A. Milne once said, "Harmsworth killed the penny dreadful by the simple process of producing the ha'penny dreadfuller." The quality of the Harmsworth/Amalgamated Press papers began to improve throughout the early 20th century, however. By the time of the First World War, papers such as Union Jack dominated the market.[5]

Legacy[edit]
Two popular characters to come out of the penny dreadfuls were Jack Harkaway, introduced in the Boys of England in 1871, and Sexton Blake, who began in the Half-penny Marvel in 1893. In 1904, the Union Jack became "Sexton Blake's own paper", and he appeared in every issue thereafter, up until the paper's demise in 1933. In total, Blake appeared in roughly 4,000 adventures, right up into the 1970s, a record only exceeded by Nick Carter and Dixon Hawke. Harkaway was also popular in America and had many imitators.

The fictional Sweeney Todd, the subject of both a successful musical by Stephen Sondheim and a feature film by Tim Burton, also first appeared in an 1846/1847 penny dreadful entitled The String of Pearls: A Romance.

Over time, the penny dreadfuls evolved into the British comic magazines. Owing to their cheap production, their perceived lack of value, and such hazards as war-time paper drives, the penny dreadfuls, particularly the earliest ones, are fairly rare today.

The experimental artrock band Animal Collective had a song called Penny Dreadfuls on their debut album Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished.

The Irish literary magazine The Penny Dreadful takes its name from the penny dreadfuls.[6]

A horror television series set in Victorian England entitled Penny Dreadful debuted on Showtime in May, 2014.

There is a character named Penny Dreadful found in The Commons in Wizard City in the popular MMORPG online game Wizard101.

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>Roderick hurried downstairs to see what his dog had discovered. He followed the sound of Bailey’s bark, and discovered him, barking angrily at the door to a closet. He was doing circles, yipping loudly, but when he heard his master’s footsteps, he cocked his head imploringly at him, and waited.
Roderick approached the closet door and without hesitation, pulled it open. It became immediately clear what had gotten Bailey so riled up. The stench of decay was pungent enough that Roderick himself could have tracked down the body by its smell, had he taken the time for a thorough search.
How the policemen could have missed it was confounding. How could London’s finest, apparently trained in investigative procedures, be so incompetent as to miss the rotting corpse that was left behind at the very home where the death had taken place? When Roderick’s aggravation subsided, he took a moment to survey the cadaver.
He’d not known Lord Connor while he was alive, but he’d seen a photograph. It was difficult to tell that this was him, however, as the entry wound of the bullet that must have killed him had rendered him more or less unrecognizable. But evidence and circumstance suggested that yes, this was the body of Lord Connor.
“Good boy,” he said in praise of Bailey, who had settled down now that the body had been unveiled.
He put a hand on the dog’s head, ruffled his fur affectionately, but kept his eyes on Connor’s body. What secrets the cadaver would reveal. Forensics was not an area with which Roderick was intimately familiar, and in all honesty, even an expert in the subject might stumble when examining a body for signs that it had come back to life after death and had subsequently been killed again.
But Roderick was determined to glean whatever he could from the evidence. It was impossible to ascertain the cause of death; one might assume, at first glance, that he had been killed by the gunshot wound. But Roderick was not convinced that this was the case. The wound was not consistent with that hypothesis. Connor might very well have been shot post-mortem, which would lend itself to the vampirism theory.
It was also clear that Connor had been dreadfully sick. His body was in an advanced state of decay, well beyond the norm for a body only so recently deceased. Black and violet sores covered his body from head to toe, his veins were a pale shade of green, and his skin a ghastly palour. The blood around his wound was dry and powdery.
And then, there were the maggots. Not entirely surprising to find maggots on a rotting corpse, but when Roderick leaned in for a closer inspection, he thought that there was something strange about them. He took a step back. He was always quick to trust his instincts, and there was something very wrong about the maggots.
Cautiously, he stooped down to get another look. Yes, that was it. They were abnormally large. Some of them more so than others. More unsettling still, the largest of the maggots were unusually coloured, greyish rather than their usual fleshy pink. And, as Roderick dared to get closer still, he saw that they had teeth.
“What in the name of—”
Bailey jumped forward, baring his teeth and getting between Roderick and the maggot-ridden body. Roderick stepped back, sickened by what he was seeing. Connor’s stomach was moving, not reanimated by its own volition, but by something writhing within. Like a woman pregnant with some…thing, his stomach was expanding. Rapidly, getting bigger.
There was a sickening crunch like the wet snap of celery, as Connor’s stomach exploded open, and the thing tore its way out of his belly. At this, Bailey retreated, suddenly too frightened to protect his master. Roderick’s eyes widened.
The creature bared its own teeth, gnashing and snapping blindly as it crawled out of the dead man’s womb. It looked like the maggots, only much larger, about Bailey’s size, and it was a sickly shade of grey, with a row of sharp white teeth.
Appalled, Roderick reached for the door. The creature seemed to hear his movement, or sense him somehow. It reared back its ugly head, and with a disturbing sound coming from its mouth, it pounced like a lunging viper. Roderick stepped aside and slammed the door shut.
Too late. The creature was on this side of the closet, with him and Bailey.</Text>

Victorian England: An Introduction
 

	
The Romantic Period: began in 1798

It ended in one of the following years:
1832--Reform Bill is passed *
1837--Victoria becomes Queen
1850 -- Death of William Wordsworth

The Victorian period: ended 1901

 

For much of this century the term Victorian, which literally describes things and events (roughly) in the reign of Queen Victoria, conveyed connotations of "prudish," "repressed," and "old fashioned." Although such associations have some basis in fact, they do not adequately indicate the nature of this complex, paradoxical age that saw great expansion of wealth, power, and culture.

In science and technology, the Victorians invented the modern idea of invention -- the notion that one can create solutions to problems, that man can create new means of bettering himself and his environment.

In religion, the Victorians experienced a great age of doubt, the first that called into question institutional Christianity on such a large scale. In literature and the other arts, the Victorians attempted to combine Romantic emphases upon self, emotion, and imagination with Neoclassical ones upon the public role of art and a corollary responsibility of the artist.

In ideology, politics, and society, the Victorians created astonishing innovation and change: democracy, feminism, unionization of workers, socialism, Marxism, and other modern movements took form. In fact, this age of Darwin, Marx, and Freud appears to be not only the first that experienced modern problems but also the first that attempted modern solutions. Victorian, in other words, can be taken to mean parent of the modern -- and like most powerful parents, it provoked a powerful reaction against itself.

The Victorian age was not one, not single, simple, or unified, only in part because Victoria's reign lasted so long that it comprised several periods. Above all, it was an age of paradox and power. The Catholicism of the Oxford Movement, the Evangelical movement, the spread of the Broad Church, and the rise of Utilitarianism, socialism, Darwinism, and scientific Agnosticism, were all in their own ways characteristically Victorian; as were the prophetic writings of Carlyle and Ruskin, the criticism of Arnold, and the empirical prose of Darwin and Huxley; as were the fantasy of George MacDonald and the realism of George Eliot and George Bernard Shaw.

More than anything else what makes Victorians Victorian is their sense of social responsibility. The poet Matthew Arnold refused to reprint his poem "Empedocles on Etna," in which the Greek philosopher throws himself into the volcano, because it set a bad example; and he criticized an Anglican bishop who pointed out mathematical inconsistencies in the Bible not on the grounds that he was wrong, but that for a bishop to point these things out to the general public was irresponsible.

The Victorian Age was characterised by rapid change and developments in nearly every sphere - from advances in medical, scientific and technological knowledge to changes in population growth and location. Over time, this rapid transformation deeply affected the country's mood: an age that began with a confidence and optimism leading to economic boom and prosperity eventually gave way to uncertainty and doubt regarding Britain's place in the world.

QUEEN VICTORIA

Born on 24 May 1819. 
On 10th June 1837, following the death of her uncle, William IV, she became queen at the age of eighteen. 
She fell instantly in love with her German cousin, Prince Albert and they were married on 10 February 1840. Between 1841 and 1857 Queen Victoria had nine children - four sons, five daughters. Prince Albert was very interested in art, science and manufacturing and took a keen interest in the building of the Crystal Palace. He died suddenly of typhoid in 1861. His widow was overcome with grief and wrote in her diary, "My life as a happy person is ended!" She wore black for the rest of her life. For a long time she refused to appear in public, which made her very unpopular. 
Queen Victoria died aged 80 on 22 January 1901 and a new age - the Edwardian - began.

IMPERIALISM

In 1876 Victoria was declared Empress of India and the English Empire was constantly being expanded. The prevailing attitude in Britain was that expansion of British control around the globe was good for everyone.

One, England had an obligation to enlighten and civilize the 'less fortunate savages' of the world (often referred to as the "White Man's Burden").
Second, they (as a chosen people) had a destiny to fulfill -- they were 'destined' to rule the world. 
Finally, they needed money, resources, labor, and new markets for expanding industry in England.

The British Empire (map) was the largest empire ever, consisting of over 25% of the world's population and area. It included India, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Rhodesia, Hong Kong, Gibraltar, several islands in the West Indies and various colonies on the African coast. In 1750 the population of Britain was 4 million. By 1851 it was 21 million. By 1900, Queen Victoria reigned over 410 million people. British Victorians were excited by geographical exploration, by the opening up of Africa and Asia to the West, yet were troubled by the intractable Irish situation and humiliated by the failures of the Boer War.
IRISH QUESTION

This was also the age of the 'Irish Question', the question being whether or not the Irish should be allowed to rule themselves. Gladstone was a constant activist for increased Irish autonomy, but his views were not widely supported, and Irish extremists began a campaign of terrorism, the fruits of which are still with us today.
RELIGION

Victorian England was a deeply religious country. A great number of people were habitual church-goers, at least once and probably twice, every Sunday. The Bible was frequently and widely read by people of every class; so too were religious stories and allegories. Yet towards the end of Queen Victoria's reign, the hold of organized religion upon the English people began to slacken for several reasons.

EDUCATION

Education in nineteenth-century England was not equal - not between the sexes, and not between the classes. Gentlemen would be educated at home by a governess or tutor until they were old enough to attend Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester, Westminster, Charterhouse, or a small handful of lesser schools. The curriculum was heavily weighted towards the classics - the languages and literature of Ancient Greece and Rome. After that, they would attend Oxford or Cambridge. Here they might also study mathematics, law, philosophy, and modern history. Oxford tended to produce more Members of Parliament and government officials, while Cambridge leaned more towards the sciences and produced more acclaimed scholars. However, it was not compulsory, either legally or socially, for a gentleman to attend school at all. He could, just as easily, be taught entirely at home. However, public school and University were the great staging grounds for public life, where you made your friends and developed the connections that would aid you later in life. Beau Brummel met the Prince of Wales at Eton and that friendship helped him conquer all of London Society despite his lack of family background. 
A lady's education was taken, almost entirely, at home. There were boarding schools, but no University, and the studies were very different. She learned French, drawing, dancing, music, and the use of globes. If the school, or the governess, was interested in teaching any practical skills, she learned plain sewing as well as embroidery, and accounts.

SCIENCE AND PROGRESS

Industrial Revolution: the developments that transformed Great Britain, between 1750 and 1830, from a largely rural population making a living almost entirely from agriculture to a town-centered society engaged increasingly in factory manufacture.

As many thousands of women throughout rural Britain saw their spinning wheels become redundant and their jobs disappear into the factories, they moved to the cities. The towns offered a better chance of work and higher wages than the countryside, where many families were trapped in dire poverty and seasonal employment. On the other hand, the countryside was healthier.

The Industrial Revolution gathered steam, and accelerated the migration of the population from country to city. The result of this movement was the development of horrifying slums and cramped row housing in the overcrowded cities. 
SOCIAL CLASS

Working class - men and women who performed physical labor, paid daily or weekly wages

Middle class - men performed mental or "clean" work, paid monthly or annually

Upper class - did not work, income came from inherited land and investments

Skilled workers (carpenters, typesetters,etc.) £75-100
Sailors and domestic staff £40-75
Laborers, soldiers £25 
DISEASES

Cholera - caused by human waste in the drinking water.
Symptoms: nausea, dizziness, vomiting, diarrhea, overwhelming thirst, cramps
Death often followed within 24 hours of the first symptom

Consumption - a tuberculosis of the lungs
Symptoms - weakness, fatigue, wasting away, blood in the lungs
(killed hundreds of thousands of English in the nineteenth century)

Typhus - spread by body lice and dirty conditions
Symptoms: delirium, headaches, rash, high fever
WOMEN AND MEN

In the late industrial era in Britain the ideology of separate spheres which assigned the private sphere to the woman and the public sphere of business, commerce and politics to the man had been widely dispersed. The home was regarded as a haven from the busy and chaotic public world of politics and business, and from the grubby world of the factory. Those who could afford to, created cosy domestic interiors with plush fabrics, heavy curtains and fussy furnishings which effectively cocooned the inhabitants from the world outside. The middle-class household contained concrete expressions of domesticity in the form of servants, décor, furnishings, entertainment and clothing. The female body was dressed to emphasise a woman's separation from the world of work.

"The majority of women (happily for them) are not very much troubled with sexual feelings of any kind" - Dr. William Acton

Dr. Acton's books were very popular, and they suggest how much truth there was in our stereotypes of the constrained character of nineteenth-century English sexual behavior. In proper middle-class and upper-class circles, women were supposed to have no sexual conduct before marriage - a hand around the waist, a small kiss, and a fervent pressing of the hand was probably the accepted limit in most cases.

Also, when a woman married, she had no independent legal status. She had no right to any money (earned, inherited, etc.), she could not make a will or buy property, she had no claim to her children, she had to move with him wherever he went. If the husband died, he could name the mother as the guardian, but he did not have to do so.

Among the working classes in London, many costermongers (street vendors) lived with their girlfriends starting in their early teens. Elsewhere in the working class, premarital sex was generally winked at, as long as the couple got married.In 1800, about a third of working-class brides were pregnant on their wedding day.

For middle- and upper-class men, premarital sex would have been with servants and prostitutes, since "nice girls" didn't go beyond the small kiss or squeeze of the hand.

There were about 80,000 "gay" women (prostitutes) and "fancy men" (pimps) in London in the mid-nineteenth century. They congregated around Covent Garden and in the theater district. They tucked part of their skirts up to indicate their business. They were especially alluring to soldiers, most of whom were forbidden to marry.

For most of the nineteenth century, homosexuality was punishable by death. However, the last execution on the grounds of "homosexuality" took place in 1830.

            <Title>Scene 51</Title>
            <Text>The next time Annabel saw Anthony Tidkins was also the first time that Annabel had ever really been caught stealing. It was nothing overly fancy. A necklace. But the theft had been overly brazen, even for her; she’d stolen it right off a lady’s neck.
She had nearly gotten away with it, too. The lady seemed not to have noticed the absence of her jewelry from her neck. She must not have felt Annabel’s little fingers unclasping the necklace while the lady shopped. It was the lady’s husband that caught her. A large, burly man who seized Annabel by the wrists and threatened to break her arms for her crime.
“Begging your pardon, sir,” Annabel heard someone saying, but there were tears stinging her eyes. The man was holding her arms so tight she really thought he might break them. “The girl is my charge. I assure you, she meant no offence. She is silly, you understand. My apologies, the girl gave me the slip. I do hope she hasn’t been bothering you too severely?”
Finally, Annabel turned to look at the man. She recognised him immediately, even with her eyes a-blur with tears. The albino handed a few coins to the brute, who relinquished his grip on Annabel’s arms, took the coins. He seized his wife’s necklace from Annabel’s trembling hand and returned it to his wife.
“Just see to it that this doesn’t happen again,” he said with a growl.
“Yes, sir,” was the albino’s reply. There was the hint of an American accent to his voice, though Annabel couldn’t place the dialect. Just that he sounded a bit different from other upper class gentlemen.
Annabel looked up at her mysterious benefactor, wondering if she ought to flee. If he had rescued her only to enact his own form of retribution. But curiosity kept her.
“What do you want?” she asked.
“Nothing at all,” he answered.
“Then why help me?” she spat.
“I didn’t like how he was treating you, and I felt I was in a position to help you,” he answered.
Annabel studied his face to see if she was lying. If he was, he was a very clever liar. She still didn’t understand why he’d helped her though.
After that, she began seeing him more and more. Occasionally, he would buy her presents. Little things like clean clothes, a new pair of boots, and even books.
“I can’t read,” she told him.
“I could teach you,” he answered.
“Why?” she asked. It was a question she asked every time she met him, without fail. No one had been kind to her without reason.
One day, he finally answered honestly.
“You have a talent that I believe could be useful to me.”
She didn’t understand.
“I want to hire you,” he said.
“I’m not for sale,” she spat.
He smiled. “I mean to say that I wish to hire you as a thief,” he explained.
“Oh,” said Annabel, feeling silly. That wasn’t what she thought he’d meant. “What do you want me to steal?”
When he told her, Annabel nodded.
“I’ll do it,” she said. “I’m Annabel, by the way.”
“Jack,” he introduced himself, extending a hand. “Jack Bernhardt.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene Two</Title>
            <Text>Roderick was still unarmed. Really, he shouldn’t have gone in the house without taking the time to arm himself, but after confronting the vampires in the alleyway and being bound, gagged, and thrown against his will into a Brougham by the goddesses of Fate, he had felt that the dangers of an empty manor would be negligible.
He was wrong. A rare occurrence, but it might be his last mistake. He backed away slowly, until his back was pressed up against the wall.
Bailey, meanwhile, was dancing circles around the overgrown maggot, yipping and snarling at it. While Roderick had to commend his companion’s effort, the monstrous creature would occasionally snarl back, causing Bailey to whimper and jump back. If this went on for too long, he worried that Bailey would be bitten, and he had no idea what effect that might have. The creature’s anomalous size must have been the result of feasting on Lord Connor, who was supposed to have come back from the dead. The logical conclusion, that whatever had caused Connor’s resurrection, it was transferable, and had caused the mutation of the maggots. What would happen to Bailey if he were to be infected by this strange disease? Roderick had no desire to find out.
“Bailey,” he said in his sternest voice. “Get away from that vile creature!”
Ignoring his master, Bailey persisted in trying to chase the creature away. Perhaps Roderick’s sternest voice wasn’t quite stern enough. Sterner measures were required.
“Very well then, Bailey. If you will not listen to reason, I shall have to vanquish the creature myself.”
Putting the decoy copy of Feast of Blood on the counter, he sought out a weapon. He found one that might be suitable. A brass poker by the fireplace. He took care not to get within striking distance as he crossed the room and seized the poker.
Then he stepped forward to face the beast, brandishing the weapon with a fencing pose. “Back, Bailey,” he said. “I’ve got this.”
The creature hissed, and Bailey retreated. Roderick stepped forward, thrusting the poker at its face. It moved back swiftly. How it could move so quickly could only be the result of a further mutation; the creature had sprouted a set of limbs. On many legs, it moved, centipede-like, snarling at Roderick as he retreated from his rod.
He swung, once, missed and lost his balance. He quickly recovered and reassumed his fencer’s pose. Roderick was not well-trained in fencing. He did not possess an athletic disposition. But he had taken fencing lessons, briefly, just long enough to learn the proper stance but not long enough to learn a proper thrust or riposte. His swings were clumsy and easily avoided by the monstrous larva. But it was enough to herd the creature into the corner of the room, where it might be more easily dispatched.
Bailey continued to yap loudly, but he kept his distance. Each time the maggot looked like it might be about to strike, Bailey would step in, bare his teeth, and growl. The maggot continued to retreat, until finally, it was cornered. No chance for it to retreat, this is where the fight would take place. It reared back and hissed, snakelike, and pounced.
Roderick stepped aside and swung, overhead. He struck the floor, narrowly missing the creature. His own hand throbbed from the blow, the rod vibrating in his hand. Before he had a chance to recover, the creature went for his legs. There was nothing to do but kick. His foot connected, striking the creature in the belly.
It flew back and struck the wall. Roderick grimaced. For once he regretted removing his shoes. At least his shoes would not be soiled. The creature was quickly recovering. Roderick struck again, this time with the fireplace poker. With an awful squish, the creature’s body split in two. Viscous black liquid splattered on the floor and on the wall.
“Ugh,” said Roderick.
Bailey was still barking. Roderick looked down and saw that the creature’s head was still moving, somehow still inching towards his feet. Still clutching the fire poker, he swung again. And again. Until, finally it ceased moved.
Just as the maggot finally stopped twitching, there was a knock from the inside of the closet door. Breathing heavily, Roderick let the fire poker clatter to the floor. The pounding continued to come from the door, with increasing frequency and volume. Roderick seized the copy of Feast of Blood from the countertop where he’d left it.
“Let’s go, Bailey,” he said. “I don’t fancy fighting any more of those things.”
This time, Bailey was quick to comply with his master’s instructions. Eagerly, they made their way to the front door. Roderick wiped his feet on the floor, thrust his bare feet into his shoes, and retreated from the Connor mansion, Bailey in tow.</Text>

London is a world itself, and its records embrace a world history. (Garwood viii)

Introduction

The origins of London slums date back to the mid eighteenth century, when the population of London, or the “Great Wen,” as William Cobbett called it, began to grow at an unprecedented rate. In the last decade of the nineteenth century London's population expanded to four million, which spurred a high demand for cheap housing. London slums arose initially as a result of rapid population growth and industrialisation. They became notorious for overcrowding, unsanitary and squalid living conditions. Most well-off Victorians were ignorant or pretended to be ignorant of the subhuman slum life, and many, who heard about it, believed that the slums were the outcome of laziness, sin and vice of the lower classes. However, a number of socially conscious writers, social investigators, moral reformers, preachers and journalists, who sought solution to this urban malady in the second half of the nineteenth century, argued convincingly that the growth of slums was caused by poverty, unemployment, social exclusion and homelessness.

The Slums of East London

 
Two of Phil May's depictions of life in the East End: East End Loafers and A Street-Row in the East End.

The most notorious slum areas were situated in East London, which was often called "darkest London," a terra incognita for respectable citizens. However, slums also existed in other parts of London, e.g. St. Giles and Clerkenwell in central London, the Devil's Acre near Westminster Abbey, Jacob's Island in Bermondsey, on the south bank of the Thames River, the Mint in Southwark, and Pottery Lane in Notting Hill.

In the last decades of the Victorian era East London was inhabited predominantly by the working classes, which consisted of native English population, Irish immigrants, many of whom lived in extreme poverty, and immigrants from Central and Eastern Europe, mostly poor Russian, Polish and German Jews, who found shelter in great numbers in Whitechapel and the adjoining areas of St. George’s-in-the-East and Mile End.

Whitechapel

 
Two views of Whitechapel by Joseph Pennell: An East End Factory and Whitechapel Shops.

Whitechapel was the hub of the Victorian East End. By the end of the seventeenth century it was a relatively prosperous district. However, some of its areas began to deteriorate in the mid eighteenth century, and in the second half of the nineteenth century they became overcrowded and crime infested.


Whitechapel from the 1849 Illustrated London News.

Many poor families lived crammed in single-room accommodations without sanitation and proper ventilation. There were also over 200 common lodging houses which provided shelter for some 8000 homeless and destitute people per night. Margaret Harkness, a social researcher and writer, rented a room in Whitechapel in order to make direct observations of degraded slum life. She described the South Grove workhouse in her slum novel, In Darkest London:

The Whitechapel Union is a model workhouse; that is to say, it is the Poor Law incarnate in stone and brick. The men are not allowed to smoke in it, not even when they are in their dotage; the young women never taste tea, and the old ones may not indulge in a cup during the long afternoons, only at half-past six o'clock morning and night, when they receive a small hunch of bread with butter scraped over the surface, and a mug of that beverage which is so dear to their hearts as well as their stomachs. The young people never go out, never see a visitor, and the old ones only get one holiday in the month. Then the aged paupers may be seen skipping like lambkins outside the doors of the Bastile, while they jabber to their friends and relations. A little gruel morning and night, meat twice a week, that is the food of the grown-up people, seasoned with hard work and prison discipline. Doubtless this Bastile offers no premium to idle and improvident habits; but what shall we say of the woman, or man, maimed by misfortune, who must come there or die in the street? Why should old people be punished for their existence? [143]

Whitechapel was the venue of murders committed in the late 1880s on several women by the anonymous serial killer, called Jack the Ripper, who probably lived in the environs of Flower and Dean Street. The national press, which reported in great detail the Whitechapel murders, also revealed to the reading public the appalling deprivation and dire poverty of the East London slum dwellers. As a result, the London County Council tried to get rid of the worst slums by introducing several slum clearance programmes, but by the end of the nineteenth century few housing schemes for the poor were implemented. Jack London, who explored the living conditions of the poor in Whitechapel for six weeks in 1902, was astounded by the misery and overcrowding of the Whitechapel slums. He wrote a book about its miserable inhabitants and gave it the title The People of the Abyss.

Spitalfields

Spitalfields, which received its name from St. Mary's Spittel (hospital) for lepers, had been once inhabited by prosperous French Huguenot silk weavers, but in the early 19th century their descendants were reduced to a deplorable condition due to the competition of the Manchester textile factories and the area began to deteriorate into crime-infested slums. The spacious and handsome Huguenot houses were divided up into tiny dwellings which were rented by poor families of labourers, who sought employment in the nearby docks.

   
Three of Leonard Raven-Hill's depictions of life in the East End: A Corner in Petticoat Lane, The Hooligans, and A 'Schnorrer' (Beggar) of the Ghetto".

In the second half of the nineteenth century Spitalfields became home for Dutch and German Jews, and later for masses of poor Polish and Russian Jewish immigrants. Brick Lane, which passes through Spitalfields, was inhabited in the 1880s mostly by Orthodox Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. By the early 1890s a number of shuls (synagogues) and chevrots (small places of worship) had been opened in Spitalfields and the neighbouring areas. The Jews' Temporary Shelter was created in 1886 at Leman Street for new immigrants arriving in London from Eastern Europe.

Many philanthropic institutions were active in Spitalfields in the second half of the nineteenth century. In 1860, Fr. Daniel Gilbert and the Sisters of Mercy opened a night refuge for destitute women and children in Providence Row. The American banker and philanthropist, George Peabody, created a foundation, which built the first improved dwellings for the “artisans and labouring poor of London” in Commercial Street in 1864. However, all these ventures were inadequate for the improvement of the living conditions of the poor. Arthur Morrison described the Brick Lane slums and its environs in The Palace Journal as places of darkness where “human vermin” lived:

Black and noisome, the road sticky with slime, and palsied houses, rotten from chimney to cellar, leaning together, apparently by the mere coherence of their ingrained corruption. Dark, silent, uneasy shadows passing and crossing – human vermin in this reeking sink, like goblin exhalations from all that is noxious around. Women with sunken, black-rimmed eyes, whose pallid faces appear and vanish by the light of an occasional gas lamp, and look so like ill-covered skulls that we start at their stare. [1023]

Bethnal Green

Bethnal Green was a place of small-scale manufacturing and shabby working-class housing. The local major employer was Allen &amp; Hanbury's, one of the biggest factories in the East End, which produced pharmaceutical and medical goods. In the last three decades of the nineteenth century, it became an area of extreme poverty and overcrowded slums. In 1884, Keble College, Oxford University, established Oxford House Settlement in Bethnal Green as part of its philanthropic activity, which consisted in providing religious, social and educational work as well as healthy recreation among the poor of East London. The Settlement housed a boy's club, gym and library. Working-class inhabitants could listen to lectures, Bible readings and concerts. The residents of Oxford House were socially-conscious members of the upper classes who wanted to get acquainted with the sordid living conditions of the poor and, simultaneously, establish better cross-class relationships based on Christian brotherhood and benevolence.

The Old Nichol

The Old Nichol, situated between High Street, Shoreditch, and Bethnal Green, was regarded as the worst slum of the East End. It consisted of 20 narrow streets containing 730 dilapidated terraced houses which were inhabited by some 6,000 people. The London County Council (LCC) decided to clear the Old Nichol slums in the 1890s, and the first council housing development in Britain, called the Boundary Estate, was built in its place shortly before 1900. The deplorable conditions of the Old Nichol were immortalised by Arthur Morrison in his slum novel, The Child of the Jago.

Slumming

In the late Victorian era London's East End became a popular destination for slumming, a new phenomenon which emerged in the 1880s on an unprecedented scale. For some slumming was a peculiar form of tourism motivated by curiosity, excitement and thrill, others were motivated by moral, religious and altruistic reasons. The economic, social and cultural deprivation of slum dwellers attracted in the second half of the nineteenth century the attention of various groups of the middle- and upper-classes, which included philanthropists, religious missionaries, charity workers, social investigators, writers, and also rich people seeking disrespectable amusements. As early as in 1884, The New York Times published an article about slumming which spread from London to New York.

Slumming commenced in London […] with a curiosity to see the sights, and when it became fashionable to go 'slumming' ladies and gentlemen were induced to don common clothes and go out in the highways and byways to see people of whom they had heard, but of whom they were as ignorant as if they were inhabitants of a strange country. [September 14, 1884 ]

In the 1880s and 1890s a great number of middle- and upper-class women and men were involved in charity and social work, particularly in the East End slums. The national press covered widely shocking and sensational news from the slums. Anxiety and curiosity about slums could be heard in many public debates to that extent that, as Seth Koven writes:

By the 1890s, London guidebooks such as the Baedeker’s not only directed visitors to shops, monuments, and churches but also mapped excursions to world renowned philanthropic institutions located in notorious slum districts such as Whitechapel and Shoreditch. [1]

In fact, for a considerable number of Victorian gentlemen and ladies slumming was a form of illicit urban tourism. They visited the most deprived streets of the East End in pursuit of the 'guilty pleasures' associated with the immoral slum dwellers. Upper-class slummers sometimes spent in disguise a night or more in poor boarding houses seeking to experience taboo intimacies with the members of the lower classes. Their cross-class sexual fellowships contributed to diminishing class barriers and reshaping gender relations at the turn of the nineteenth century.

However, slumming was not only limited to odd amusement. In the last two decades of the Victorian era a rising number of missionaries, social relief workers and investigators, politicians, journalists and fiction writers as well as middle-class ‘do-gooders’ and philanthropists made frequent visits to the East End slums to see how the poor lived. A number of gentlemen and lady slummers decided to take up temporary residence in the East End in order to collect data on the nature and extent of poverty and deprivation. Some slummers were disguised in underclass drags in order to transgress class boundaries and mix freely with the poverty stricken inhabitants of the slums. Written or oral accounts of their first-hand observations arose public conscience and motivation to provide slum welfare programmes, and prompted political demands for slum reform.

The last two decades of the nineteenth century witnessed the upsurge of public inquiry into the causes and extent of poverty in Britain. Some of the most outstanding late Victorian slummers were Princess Alice of Hesse, the third child of Queen Victoria; Lord Salisbury, and his sons, William and Hugh, who resided temporarily in Oxford House, Bethnal Green; William Gladstone, and his daughter Helen, who lived in the south London slums as head of the Women's University Settlement. (Koven 10) Even Queen Victoria visited the East End to open the People’s Palace in Mile End Road in 1887.

Benevolent middle- and upper-class women went to slums for a variety of purposes. They volunteered in parish charities, worked as nurses and teachers and some of them conducted sociological studies. Such women as Annie Besant, Lady Constance Battersea, Helen Bosanquet, Clara Collet, Emma Cons, Octavia Hill, Margaret Harkness, Beatrice Potter (Webb), and Ella Pycroft explored some of London’s most notorious rookeries, and their eye-witness reports gradually changed the public opinion about the causes of poverty and squalor. By the turn of the nineteenth century thousands of men and women were involved in social work and philanthropy in London slums.

Slum Exploration Literature

In the second half of the nineteenth century, London slums attracted the attention of journalists and social researchers, who described them as areas of extreme poverty, degradation, crime and violence, and called for an immediate public action to improve the living and sanitary conditions of the working classes. “Slums ceased to be regarded as a disease in themselves and gradually came to be viewed as a symptom of a much larger social ill.” (Wohl 223) A number of contemporary accounts about subhuman life in the slums aroused public concern. Some of them helped prepare the subsequent slum reform and clearance legislations.

Out of a great number of publications that dealt with London slums, mention should be made of Hector Gavin's Sanitary Ramblings: Being Sketches and Illustrations of Bethnal Green (1848), Henry Mayhew's London Labour and London Poor (1851), John Garwood's The Million-People City (1853), John Hollinghead's Ragged London (1861), J. Ewing Ritchie's The Night Side of London (1861), James Greenwood's The Seven Curses of London (1869) and The Wilds of London (1874), Adolphe Smith's Street Life in London (1877), Andrew Mearns' The Bitter Cry of Outcast London (1883), George Sims' How the Poor Live (1883), Henry King's Savage London (1888), Walter Besant's East London (1899), Charles Booth's monumental report, Life and Labour of the People in London (17 volumes, 1889–1903), and B. S. Rowntree’s Poverty: A Study of Town Life (1901). All these reports are valuable social documents which provide background information about the deplorable slum conditions in late Victorian London. They are available in an electronic form on the Internet.

Conclusion

There is little doubt that late Victorian slums were the consequence of the rapid industrialisation and urbanisation of the country, which led to a more dramatic spatial separation between the rich and the poor, known as the two-nation divide, with incomparably different lifestyles and living standards. Slumming, which became a way of getting immersed in slum culture, contributed to the development of public awareness that slum conditions were not providential and deviant, but rather afflicted by the economy and circumstances, and could be improved by an adequate economic, social and cultural policy.

            <Title>Scene 52</Title>
            <Text>Over the years, Anthony—known to her in those days as Jack—had introduced Annabel to several of his acquaintances, many of whom were, quite frankly, criminals. Her services were highly sought after by Anthony’s friends, and Annabel was all too happy to oblige and was quick to adapt her skill as a pickpocket to the theft of more valuable items, sought by the ton in part due to their illegal nature. Paintings, such as the one Annabel had provided for Mr. Sinews, for example; ancient Egyptian artifacts, which had required Annabel to break into museums; and more importantly, evidence, records, and files, which Annabel was able to rescue from the police without too much difficulty.
Then there was also the research that Annabel had stolen on Anthony’s behalf. This, according to Anthony, was the real reason he’d hired her. Her benefactor was a scientist, and though he was still in his teenage years when she met him, he was educated as a physician, had gone to university, and had studied under one of America’s most prominent doctors. Dr. Allen. Anthony’s pursuit of science was obsessive. He’d taken to pursuing shortcuts whenever possible.
He was not above stealing the research of other scientists. Annabel had personally visited the homes and laboratories of Charles Darwin, Edward Jenner, John Hunter, John Boyd Dunlop, Lord Kelvin, and Nikola Tesla, among others, and had returned to Anthony with unpublished studies, notes, and specimen, whatever he required for his endless pursuit of...
Annabel knew not what it was exactly that Anthony was studying.
But until now, she had always believed that while Anthony’s methods were criminal, his intentions were benevolent. He held life as the most precious gift. He’d often spoken to Annabel passionately about wanting to make a difference in the world. Every life, he’d always said, was worth saving. This, Annabel had always felt, was why he’d saved hers, all those years ago. He’d taken her in, given her a home and a purpose, helped her to elevate her social and financial position. And years later, he’d saved her yet again, when her eye had been ripped from its socket.
It was for this reason that she felt a mild stinging in the back of her eyes, as she realized that Anthony was utterly, completely insane. She’d been taken in by his lies.
“What do you want with me, Jack?” she hissed. It was the only way to keep herself from crying. She wouldn’t let herself be weak, not in front of him. So she set her mouth in a cruel sneer and glared at the young man who’d treated her as a sister. “You tried to kill me.”
Anthony laughed. He sounded different. Perhaps that’s why she hadn’t recognized it before. Not just because it was muffled by the mask, but because there was a cruelty that had crept into his voice. There was no joy to his laughter.
“At the masquerade, you mean? You knew that was me?,” he asked.
Annabel kept her mouth shut, her eyes fixed dangerously on him.
“I wasn’t trying to kill you,” he said. “I was testing my hypothesis.”
While he spoke, Annabel was still looking for a way out. There had to be some way of getting past the dozens of Resurrectionists, even with their guns trained on her. She just had to wait for the right moment to present itself.
“What hypothesis?”
Before he had a chance to answer, a door swung open. She wanted to hear what Anthony had to say, but the door was open, and this might be her only chance. She stepped through the door, pushing past the Resurrectionist that had opened it, shoving him out of her way.
“Stop her!” Anthony cried.
Ignoring him, the Resurrectionist turned to the door and bolted it shut.</Text>

The Mysteries of London
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
The Mysteries of London is a penny dreadful or city mysteries novel begun by George W. M. Reynolds in 1844. Reynolds wrote the first two series of this long-running narrative of life in the seedy underbelly of mid-nineteenth-century London. Thomas Miller wrote the third series and Edward L. Blanchard wrote the fourth series of this immensely popular title.

Michael Angelo in Penny Dreadfuls and Other Victorian Horrors writes:


Instalments were published weekly and contained a single illustration and eight pages of text printed in double columns. The weekly numbers were later bound in cloth covers with a fresh title page and table of contents and offered as complete works of fiction.

After Reynolds quit The Mysteries of London, he began a new title: The Mysteries of the Court of London, which ran from 1848 until 1856.

Plot[edit]
The closest the stories have to a hero is the character Richard Markham, and the most villainous of the cast of villains the Resurrection Man, a serial killer.[1]

Part of Charles Booth's poverty map showing the Old Nichol, a slum in the East End of London. Published 1889 in Life and Labour of the People in London. The red areas are "middle class, well-to-do", light blue areas are “poor, 18s to 21s a week for a moderate family”, dark blue areas are “very poor, casual, chronic want”, and black areas are the "lowest class...occasional labourers, street sellers, loafers, criminals and semi-criminals".
During the 19th century, London was transformed into the world's largest city and capital of the British Empire. Its population expanded from 1 million in 1800 to 6.7 million a century later (1.9% average annual growth). During this period, London became a global political, financial, and trading capital. In this position, it was largely unrivaled until the latter part of the century, when Paris and New York City began to threaten its dominance.
While the city grew wealthy as Britain's holdings expanded, 19th century London was also a city of poverty, where millions lived in overcrowded and unsanitary slums. Life for the poor was immortalized by Charles Dickens in such novels as Oliver Twist.
One of the most famous events of 19th-century London was the Great Exhibition of 1851. Held at The Crystal Palace, the fair attracted visitors from across the world and displayed Britain at the height of its Imperial dominance.
As the capital of a massive empire, London became a magnet for immigrants from the colonies and poorer parts of Europe. A large Irish population settled in the city during the Victorian era, with many of the newcomers refugees from the Great Famine (1845-1849). At one point, Irish immigrants made up about 20% of London's population. London also became home to a sizable Jewish community, and small communities of Chinese and South Asians settled in the city

19th century London was transformed by the coming of the railways. A new network of metropolitan railways allowed for the development of suburbs in neighbouring counties from which middle-class and wealthy people could commute to the centre. While this spurred the massive outward growth of the city, the growth of greater London also exacerbated the class divide, as the wealthier classes emigrated to the suburbs, leaving the poor to inhabit the inner city areas.
The first railway to be built in London was the London and Greenwich Railway a short line from London Bridge to Greenwich, which opened in 1836. This was soon followed by the opening of great rail termini which linked London to every corner of Britain. These included Euston station (1837), Paddington station (1838), Fenchurch Street station (1841), Waterloo station (1848), King's Cross station (1850), and St Pancras station (1863). From 1863, the first lines of the London Underground were constructed.

In 1829 the prime minister Robert Peel established the Metropolitan Police as a police force covering the entire urban area. The force gained the nickname of "bobbies" or "peelers" named after Robert Peel.
London's urbanised area continued to grow rapidly, spreading into Islington, Paddington, Belgravia, Holborn, Finsbury, Shoreditch, Southwark and Lambeth. With London's rapid growth, towards the middle of the century, there became an urgent need to reform London's system of local government.
Outside of the City of London which resisted any attempts to expand its boundaries to encompass the wider urban area, London had a chaotic local government system consisting of ancient parishes and vestries, working alongside a vast array of single purpose boards and authorities, few of which co-operated with each other. In an attempt to solve this problem, in 1855 the Metropolitan Board of Works (MBW) was created to provide London with adequate infrastructure to cope with its growth. The MBW was London's first metropolitan government body.


The Crystal Palace in 1851.
One of its first tasks was addressing London's sanitation problems. At the time, raw sewage was pumped straight into the River Thames. This culminated in The Great Stink of 1858. The polluted drinking water (sourced from the Thames) also brought disease and epidemics to London's populace.
Parliament finally gave consent for the MBW to construct a massive system of sewers. The engineer put in charge of building the new system was Joseph Bazalgette. In what was one of the largest civil engineering projects of the 19th century, he oversaw construction of over 2100 km of tunnels and pipes under London to take away sewage and provide clean drinking water. When the London sewerage system was completed, the death toll in London dropped dramatically, and epidemics of cholera and other diseases were curtailed. Bazalgette's system is still in use today.
The Metropolitan Board of Works was not a directly elected body, which made it unpopular with Londoners. In 1888 it was wound up, and replaced with the London County Council (LCC). This was the first elected London-wide administrative body. The LCC covered the same area as the MBW had done, but this area was designated as the County of London. In 1900, the county was sub-divided into 28 metropolitan boroughs, which formed a more local tier of administration than the county council.

The String of Pearls
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
The String of Pearls: A Romance is the title of a fictional story first published as a penny dreadful serial from 1846-47. The main antagonist of the story is the infamous Sweeney Todd, "the Demon Barber of Fleet Street," who here makes his literary debut.

Todd is a barber who murders his customers and turns their remains into meat pies, sold at the pie shop of his partner in crime: Mrs. Lovett; Todd's barber shop is situated in Fleet Street, London, next to St. Dunstan's church, and is connected to Lovett's bakers shop in nearby Bell Yard by means of an underground passage. Todd dispatches his victims by pulling a lever while they are in his barber chair, which makes them fall backward down a revolving trapdoor, generally causing them to break their necks or skulls. In the event they are alive, he goes to the basement and "polishes them off" by slitting the victim's throat with his straight razor. Todd has a young assistant named Tobias Ragg.

Synopsis[edit]
The story is set in London in the year 1785. The plot concerns the strange disappearance of a sailor named Lieutenant Thornhill, last seen entering Sweeney Todd's establishment on Fleet Street. Thornhill was bearing a gift of a string of pearls to a girl named Johanna Oakley on behalf of her missing lover, Mark Ingestrie, who is presumed lost at sea. One of Thornhill's seafaring friends, Colonel Jeffrey, is alerted to the disappearance of Thornhill by his faithful dog, Hector, and investigates his whereabouts. He is joined by Johanna, who wants to know what happened to Mark.

Johanna's suspicions of Sweeney Todd's involvement lead her to the desperate and dangerous expedient of dressing up as a boy and entering Todd's employment, after his last assistant, Tobias Ragg, has been incarcerated in a madhouse for accusing Todd of being a murderer. Eventually, the full grisly horror of Todd's activities is uncovered when the dismembered remains of hundreds of his victims are discovered in the crypt underneath St. Dunstan's church. Meanwhile, Mark, who has been imprisoned in the cellars beneath the pie shop and put to work as the cook, escapes via the lift used to bring the pies up from the cellar into the pie-shop. Here he makes the following startling announcement to the customers of that establishment:

"Ladies and gentlemen - I fear that what I am going to say will spoil your appetites; but the truth is beautiful at all times, and I have to state that Mrs. Lovett's pies are made of human flesh!"[1]
Mrs. Lovett is then poisoned by Sweeney Todd who is, himself, apprehended and hanged. Johanna marries Mark and lives happily ever after.

Literary history[edit]
The String of Pearls: A Romance was published in eighteen weekly parts, in Edward Lloyd's The People's Periodical and Family Library, issues 7-24, 21 November 1846 to 20 March 1847. It was probably written by James Malcolm Rymer and Thomas Peckett Prest, alternating between each part released. The story was then published in book form in 1850 as The String of Pearls, subtitled "The Barber of Fleet Street. A Domestic Romance". This expanded version of the story was 732 pages long. In later years there were many different literary, stage and eventually film adaptations which renamed, expanded and often drastically altered the original story.[2]

A scholarly, annotated edition of The String of Pearls was published in volumes in 2007 by the Oxford University Press under the title of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, edited by Robert Mack.

Themes[edit]
Penny dreadfuls were often written carelessly and contained themes of gore and violence. The String of Pearls is no different. Its style of writing makes it a perfect example of a penny dreadful, sensational, violent subject matter that plays off of the public’s real fears. The success of the stories lies in the guttural reaction people have towards it. Themes like murder and cannibalism equally scare and attract people leading to the success of the stories. The story plays on our instinctual fear of cannibalism, the eating of ones own species. Being such a taboo, the theme of cannibalism contributes to the horror tone to the story. Unknowingly being served human to eat is a common fear in popular culture, as it is so revolting to imagine. Industrialization is a theme that contributes to the unfolding of the story as the story was published in the 1840's, which was in the midst of Great Britian's Industrial Revolution."The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. This transition included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, improved efficiency of water power, the increasing use of steam power, and the development of machine tools. It also included the change from wood and other bio-fuels to coal"[3]Sweeny Todd owns a barber shop in the middle of one of the busiest industrial centers of the growing city of London. The rise of industrialism resulted in the rise of crime rates. This rise of crime was immensely influential when it came to the String of Pearls and other Penny dreadful stories that revolved around the fearful ideas and themes of crime, fear, and gore.

Historical Background[edit]
While there is no clear author of The Nineteenth Century String of Pearls in the original Penny Dreadful, there are many theories surrounding its influences. In the Victorian time, when this story was first written, a semi-common trade was what was called a barber-surgeon. Barber-surgeons cropped up around this time as trained medical practitioners, not through school but through apprenticeship and they were illiterate. The story goes that in front of a barber-surgeons workplace there would be a red and white pole (much like in front of Sweeney Todd’s shop), symbolizing the blood and napkins used during the bloodletting. In 1745, surgery became an established and well regarded profession of its own and the two were officially separated by King George II.[4]

Speculated Influences[edit]
Le Theatre des Antiquites de Paris[edit]
Le Theatre des Antiquites de Paris by Jacques du Breuil contains a section, titled, De la maison des Marmousets that talks of a "murderous pastry cook" and incorporates the meat of a man he murdered in his pie due to dietary benefits over eating other animals.[5]

Real Life Sweeney Todd or Urban Legend?[edit]
It is speculated that, “Joseph Fouche, who served as Minister of Police in Paris from 1799 to 1815, had records in the archives of police that explored murders committed in the 1800s by a Parisian barber". Fouche made mention that the barber was in league with “a neighboring pastry cook, who made pies out of the victims and sold them for human consumption”. There is question about the authenticity of this account, “yet the tale was republished in 1824 under the headline "A Terrific Story of the Rue de Le Harpe, Paris" in The Tell Tale, a London magazine. Perhaps Thomas Prest, scouring publications for ideas, read about the Paris case and stored it away for later use.”[6]

Sweeney Todd's story also appears in the “Newgate Calendar, originally a bulletin of executions produced by the keeper of Newgate prison, the title of which was appropriated by chapbooks, popular pamphlets full of entertaining, often violent criminal activities.” Despite this mention there is no word of Todd's surely trial or execution in official records, and thus no real evidence that he ever existed.[7]

No public records prove existence of a London barber by the name of Sweeney in the 18th century or of a barber shop located on Fleet Street. However, there was enough word-of-mouth, true crime and horror stories traveling around at the time, reported in "The Old Bailey" section of the London Times, as well as other daily newspapers. Since news commonly traveled by word of mouth from majority of the population still being illiterate, news of crime passed from person to person, creating the possibility of embellishment, but were considered to be factual during the time because there was no way of proving otherwise at the time.[8]

Charles Dickens[edit]
In Charles Dickens' Pickwick Papers (1836–37), a character, Sam Weller, states that a pieman used cats "for beefsteak, veal and kidney, 'cording to the demand", and recommends that people should buy pies only "when you know the lady as made it, and is quite sure it ain't kitten."[9] Dickens expanded on the idea of using non-traditional sources for meat pie in ''Martin Chuzzlewit'' (1843–44), this was released two years before The String of Pearls (1846–47) and included a character by the name of, Tom Pinch, who feels lucky that his own "evil genius did not lead him into the dens of any of those preparers of cannibalic pastry, who are represented in many country legends as doing a lively retail business in the metropolis" and worries that John Westlock will "begin to be afraid that I have strayed into one of those streets where the countrymen are murdered; and that I have been made into meat pies, or some such horrible thing."[10][11] Haining suggests that Dickens was inspired by knowledge of the "real" Sweeney Todd, but that he forbore to mention him lest some of his victims' relatives were still alive.

Adaptations[edit]
Live Theater[edit]
The first recorded live theater performance influenced by "The String of Pearls" was Mrs. Lovett by Miss Hamilton performed at the Britannia Theatre, Hoxton, on March 1, 1847, the same year the penny dreadful story was published.[12] This adaptation reflects the popularity of the penny dreadful story since it was performed so quickly after the story's original publication. The second trace we find of "The String of Pearls" influence in the theater is in 1847, when multiple productions revolving around Todd's story are performed: "Sweeney Todd, the Barber of Fleet Street" by Mark Howard, "Tobias Ragg, Sweeney Todd's Apprentice-boy" by Miss Burrows, and "Mrs. Lovett, Sweeney Todd's Accomplice in Guilt" by Mrs.Atkinson at the Britannia Theatre.[13] George Dibdin Pitt is largely remembered for writing a full length play revolving around Sweeney Todd. "Not published until 1883 in Dick's Standard Plays (as Sweeney Todd: The Barber of Fleet Street), the printed play differs significantly from Dibdin Pitt's original, which was initially performed in 1847 as The String of Pearls, or The Fiend of Fleet Street. Yet the text from the original manuscript (archived in the Lord Chamberlain's Plays at the British Library) has never before been published and has received very little scholarly attention. Scholars who rely on the 1883 Sweeney Todd to discuss the 1847 melodrama are in many respects talking about a different play. "[14]

Today the best known adaptation is the musical Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber on Fleet Street. In 1979 Stephen Sondheim adapted the String of Pearls into a musical. The musical tells the tale of Sweeney Todd and Mrs. Lovett and how they come to be in business with one and another. The show opened on March 1, 1979, in the Uris Theater and had a total of 557 shows until it closed on June 29, 1980.[15] One of the early reviews called the show “one giant step towards vegetarianism”.[16] Then next run of the show started September 14, 1989 and had a run of 188 shows at the Circle in the Square Theater, and then it ran again at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre for 349 shows beginning on November 3, 2005.[17]

Literature[edit]
Todd's story made it's way to America when it was pirated by 'Captain Merry', other wise known as Harry Hazel in the 1850s.[18] In London, another version was published under the title of "A Thrilling Story of the Old City of London. Founded on Fact" by one A. Ritchie in 1892.[19]

In 1929 Sweeney Todd's story was adapted for Pearson Press.[20]

In his 2012 novel Dodger, Terry Pratchett portrays Sweeney Todd as a tragic figure, having lost his mind after being exposed to the horrors of the Napoleonic Wars as a barber surgeon.[21]

Movie[edit]
The musical went on to become a successful musical film in 2007, directed by Tim Burton. The film stars Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall, Sacha Baron Cohen, Jamie Campbell Bower, and Jayne Wisener.[22] The movie won an Oscar and several other awards. In the box office this movie made $52,898,073 in the US and $99,625,091 worldwide.[23] The story is about Mr. Sweeney Todd being done an injustice by a judge in London, who ships him off to prison, and then Mr. Todd comes back to London to get revenge on the Judge. He finds out that his wife committed suicide, and the judge has raised his daughter, all which makes him hate this judge more and want more revenge.

            <Title>Scene Two</Title>
            <Text>Anthony returned home with a bloody lip and a black eye.
“Let me see your face,” said Mrs. Cartwright in that stern voice of hers. “Have you been fighting again, young man?”
“Yes, ma’am,” he admitted, shamefaced.
“You know I have to let your father know,” she said.
Anthony smiled.
“Yes, Mrs. Cartwright. I understand.”
“Be a good lad and run along to your room,” she said. “I’ll bring your supper up in a minute.”
He nodded and excused himself. He did as she asked, but he left his room open a crack, so he could overhear the conversation when Mrs. Cartwright told Anthony’s father about the fighting. When she did, his father hardly seemed interested.
“Boys will be boys,” he muttered, clearly distracted by something.
Mrs. Cartwright sighed. Through the crack in the door, Anthony saw the conversation unfold.
"I'm busy, Mrs. Cartwright, if you please."
“Sir,” she said, but Anthony’s father barely looked up.
In some ways, Anthony would have prefered to be punished to being ignored. It had gotten worse since his mother passed away a few years ago.
Anthony quickly hid his face from the crack in the door so he wouldn’t be caught eavesdropping. Not that he’d be in trouble for eavesdropping. His father didn't care for anything but his work. He sat down on his bed and opened his book, just as Mrs. Cartwright came in.
"What's that you're reading?"
"Mysteries of London," he told her.
"Not another penny dreadful, is it?" she asked. "You know your father doesn't like you reading that sort of thing."
Anthony pretended not to hear her, keeping his eyes on the book. Stupid of her to use his father as an excuse for telling him not to read his penny blood, he thought. His father didn't care.
And besides, Anthony had tried reading other books. Like his father's medical books. At first, the scientific terminology and elevated scholarly language was beyond his understanding. But the more he began to read, the more he began to understand, and the more obsessive he became with his father’s books. Anthony had expected his father to praise him for taking his education upon himself, or to appreciate that they shared a common interest. But that was not to be. Now, his father's books remained behind a locked cabinet, and Anthony was left reading penny dreadfuls.

            <Synopsis>Aboard the Dreadful, Jonathan asks to see the damage to Annabel’s bitten arm. When she rolls up her sleeve, however, she reveals that her arm is mechanical. Rather than shying away from her, as Annabel expects, Jonathan is fascinated. They kiss.

            <Text>“Let’s see the damage,” said Jonathan.
Annabel hadn’t been sure he’d seen the zombie biting into her arm. She’d hoped he hadn’t. Things would be so much simpler if he hadn’t. But now Jonathan was staring at her, waiting for her to roll up her sleeve. Kip, Kass, and Abraham Palmer were crowded behind him, and even Roderick Steen had a crease across his brow, a line of worry.
“I’m fine,” Annabel said, pushing her way past all of them.
She crossed the wide room, pausing to regain her balance as the airship hit a patch of turbulence, and took a seat at the bar. Doing her best to ignore the stares she could feel on the back of her head, she borrowed a rag from the barman and began to wipe down her crossbow. She had taken quite a liking to it. It was surprisingly light, a one-handed variation on the traditional crossbow, with a pistol-like grip, and was made of dark, polished wood. Much to her chagrin, it was already stained with blood. She scrubbed a bit harder to see if she could still get the blood out.
“Let me see your arm,” Jonathan persisted.
She hadn’t even noticed him come up behind her and take a seat at her side. She swung around, glaring at him.
“I said I’m fine.”
“I must insist,” Jonathan replied. He was looking at her with concern and with something else in his expression as well—attraction? Was it possible he felt the same magnetic pull she did when she looked at him? God, she thought. One look into his eyes and she just wanted to melt into his arms. How embarrassing! She was supposed to be a hardened criminal, yet here she was, simpering like a schoolgirl.
Annabel swore.
“You do realize that a bite from one of these creatures can be fatally infectious? If your skin is punctured…” he continued.
She looked up from her task. She’d borrowed a rag from the barman, and after wiping the blood from her face, was using it to clean her shoes. She fixed Jonathan with a deadly stare. “I’m. Fine.”
Apparently not being one to back down, Jonathan ignored the warning in her voice. “We don’t know for certain that you’re immune,” he said, concern written all over his face. “Please, don’t be stubborn.”
“He’s right, you know,” said Palmer.
Annabel spun around in her chair to look at him. She noticed that Kipper Lockwood and Miss Clementine had disappeared, either to resume their duties with the ship’s operation or, possibly, to give Annabel a bit of space.
“If you’ve been bitten, and if you’ve been infected, it’s possible we can still stop the infection from spreading if we amputate,” Palmer continued.
Finally, Annabel relented. She began by peeling off her glove. “Little late for that,” she said.
“It may very well be,” said Jonathan, managing to sound both sarcastic and concerned for her welfare.
Then Annabel drew back her sleeve, and he fell silent.
Jonathan was staring at her in silence, her reluctance to allow him to examine her arm now made clear. As she’d said, it was too late to amputate.
Annabel’s right arm was a prosthetic. Like the clockwork eye she strapped to her face each morning, it was made of mechanical parts. Gears which clicked as she rotated her forearm, hydraulics which hissed as she flexed her artificial muscles. Gears clicked with the steady rhythm of a clock each time she rotated her wrist. Each joint bore a keyhole. The key with which she wound her clockwork eye was a perfect fit for her arm as well.
It was made of copper and brass, with the same extraordinary workmanship as her mechanical eye. It moved with quiet motions, even as the gears whirred and clicked. She demonstrated the dexterity in her hand by flexing each of her fingers in turn, clenching her hand into a fist.
“See,” she said, “No bite marks.”
In awe, Jonathan reached out a hand to touch her arm.
“Don’t,” she warned him.
He retracted his hand.
“Sorry,” he said. “It’s just…”
“What?” she said, covering up her arm again with her sleeve. “Freakish? Inhuman?”
“Fascinating,” he murmured. He was looking at her in a way that she found unsettling. Unsettling in that it was sincere, honest, and—dare she think it—affectionate.
She blushed. No one had ever looked at her in this way, not after they’d seen her arm. Most men blanched at the sight of her eye and at the hideous scar that ran down the length of her face. She was pretty, sure, but she was also disfigured. If the eye wasn’t enough to turn men away, her arm most certainly was.
But Jonathan reached out, gently, and touched her cheek. She flushed, hot, and felt her heart flutter in her chest.
“You’re not a freak,” said Jonathan. “I think you’re extraordinary.”
For a moment, the rest of the world slipped away, and she forgot about the zombies that plagued the city, and about the Resurrectionists, and about the other eyes in the room looking at her. There was only her and Jonathan.
He put his hand against the back of her neck, leaned in close, and let his lips linger half an inch from hers.
Almost against her will, she reached out in return, and pressed her brass hand against the back of his neck, pressed her body close to his, and pressed her lips against his. She felt too vulnerable, too exposed, with her arm uncovered like this.
Her breath caught in her throat, and she felt a warmth in her very bones, as he returned her kiss. Her heart hammered more furiously than when she’d been fighting off the dead. She felt her cheeks flush, red-hot. It started as a gentle kiss, his lips tenderly caressing hers, but it quickly gave way to passion and fire, and he kissed her roughly, grasping her by the back of the head tightly.
Maddeningly, he suddenly pulled away from her, but it was only to catch his breath. Then he leaned back in and began to plant kisses upon her neck, small wet kisses that moved their way up her neck and caused her to grasp the hair on the back of his neck and press herself as close to him as she could. She pressed her left hand against his hip, and she moaned softly as his teeth tugged at the lobe of her ear.
He put his hand upon her arm. She couldn’t feel it there, not exactly, but she felt a slight pressure in her shoulder, where the prosthesis was affixed to her flesh.
After a moment, she drew back and looked at him like an addict might look at a bottle of absinthe. With a mixture of wariness and attraction. She staggered back. Her expression changed as she remembered their surroundings.
They were both wearing clothes soiled by blood and gore, and in the background, even louder than the whirring motors of the Dreadful, they heard a city swarmed by the dead. It was apocalyptic. Keening, inhuman groans, and the intermittent sounds of living men and women and children screaming. Windows shattering, fires burning. And in their presence, Roderick carried a bundle of mourning clothes.
“My god,” Annabel said. “Such horror abounds, and yet here we are. Locking lips while the plague spreads. We must truly be deviants.”
“I’m sorry,” he told her.
“Don’t be,” Annabel replied, leaning towards him once more. She whispered in his ear, “I’m afraid I rather liked it.”
It was Jonathan’s turn to turn bright red. His cheeks dimpled. “I’m glad you’re alright,” he said.
“Well,” said Roderick, clapping his hands together. “If you two lovebirds are quite finished, I believe we have a heist to plan.”
“Apologies, Roderick,” Jonathan said. “Here you are, grieving for poor Rémy, while Miss Monday and I are…well, expressing affection.”
Roderick brushed aside her concern with a flick of his wrist.
“Think nothing of it,” he said, although Annabel worried that his nonchalance was an affectation. “You barely knew Rémy. That’s my fault, really. I took him for granted. But don’t let that stop you. After all, given the state of our beloved city, we may not survive the day. As Miss Monday said earlier, we might as well do what we can do enjoy it.”
Palmer cleared his throat. “That said, we do have a heist to plan.”
“How hard can it be?” asked Annabel with a smirk. “We simply sneak into the Resurrectionists’ secret hideout, find and assassinate Anthony Tidkins, break into the underground facility and walk out with their research, right under their noses.”
“Well, when you put it that way…” said Kass.
“There’s one other detail,” said Palmer.
“Yes,” Jonathan agreed.
Annabel looked to the older gentleman for an explanation.
“Mrs. Grimmer is still with the Resurrectionists,” Palmer explained. “We can only hope that they are still convinced she is loyal to their cause, but it’s possible I may have put her in danger by betraying them by helping you escape.”
“Either way, we need to find her and get her out of there,” said Jonathan.
“Any idea where she’ll be?” asked Annabel. “Are we even sure they’ll still be in the laboratory? Wouldn’t they be smarter to get out of the city?”
“They certainly won’t stick around forever,” Palmer answered, “Which is why we’ll need to act quickly. I had copies of the building plans in my office, including the layout of the facility, with each of its points of access. I helped Charles Grimmer come up with the plan to build the facility. Unfortunately, I didn’t have a chance to take the plans with me.”
“Do you think you could make a sketch?” Jonathan asked.
“The details are etched quite firmly in my memory,” Palmer answered. “Just give me an hour or so to put it down on paper.”</Text>

Albert Maignan's "Green Muse" (1895): A poet succumbs to the Green Fairy.
Absinthe (i/ˈæbsɪnθ/ or /ˈæbsænθ/; French: [apsɛ̃t]) is historically described as a distilled, highly alcoholic (45–74% ABV / 90-148 proof) beverage.[1][2][3][4] It is an anise-flavoured spirit derived from botanicals, including the flowers and leaves of Artemisia absinthium (a.k.a. "grand wormwood"), together with green anise, sweet fennel, and other medicinal and culinary herbs. Absinthe traditionally has a natural green colour but may also be colourless. It is commonly referred to in historical literature as "la fée verte" (the green fairy). Although it is sometimes mistakenly referred to as a liqueur, absinthe is not traditionally bottled with added sugar, and is therefore classified as a spirit.[5] Absinthe is traditionally bottled at a high level of alcohol by volume, but is normally diluted with water prior to being consumed.
Absinthe originated in the canton of Neuchâtel in Switzerland in the late 18th century. It rose to great popularity as an alcoholic drink in late 19th- and early 20th-century France, particularly among Parisian artists and writers. Owing in part to its association with bohemian culture, the consumption of absinthe was opposed by social conservatives and prohibitionists. Ernest Hemingway, Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine, Arthur Rimbaud, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Amedeo Modigliani, Vincent van Gogh, Oscar Wilde, Aleister Crowley, Erik Satie and Alfred Jarry were all known absinthe drinkers.[6]
Absinthe has often been portrayed as a dangerously addictive psychoactive drug.[7] The chemical compound thujone, although present in the spirit in only trace amounts, was blamed for its alleged harmful effects. By 1915, absinthe had been banned in the United States and in much of Europe, including France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Although absinthe was vilified, it has not been demonstrated to be any more dangerous than ordinary spirits. Any psychoactive properties attributed to absinthe, apart from that of the alcohol, have been much exaggerated.[7] A revival of absinthe began in the 1990s, following the adoption of modern European Union food and beverage laws that removed longstanding barriers to its production and sale. By the early 21st century, nearly 200 brands of absinthe were being produced in a dozen countries, most notably in France, Switzerland, USA, Spain, and the Czech Republic.

The French word absinthe can refer either to the alcoholic beverage or, less commonly, to the actual wormwood plant, with grande absinthe being Artemisia absinthium, and petite absinthe being Artemisia pontica. The Latin name artemisia comes from Artemis, the ancient Greek goddess of the hunt. Absinthe is derived from the Latin absinthium, which in turn is the latinisation of the ancient Greek ἀψίνθιον apsínthion, "wormwood".[8] The use of Artemisia absinthium in a drink is attested in Lucretius' De Rerum Natura (I 936–950), where Lucretius indicates that a drink containing wormwood is given as medicine to children in a cup with honey on the brim to make it drinkable. This was a metaphor for the presentation of complex ideas in poetic form.[9]
Some claim that the word means "undrinkable" in Greek, but it may instead be linked to the Persian root spand or aspand, or the variant esfand, which meant Peganum harmala, also called Syrian Rue—although it is not actually a variety of rue, another famously bitter herb. That Artemisia absinthium was commonly burned as a protective offering may suggest that its origins lie in the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European root *spend, meaning "to perform a ritual" or "make an offering". Whether the word was a borrowing from Persian into Greek, or from a common ancestor of both, is unclear.[10] Alternatively, the Greek word may originate in a pre-Greek Pelasgian word, marked by the non-Indoeuropean consonant complex νθ.
Alternate spellings for absinthe include absinth, absynthe, and absenta. Absinth (without the final e) is a spelling variant most commonly applied to absinthes produced in central and eastern Europe, and is specifically associated with Bohemian-style absinthes.[11]



Henri Privat-Livemont's 1896 poster
The precise origin of absinthe is unclear. The medical use of wormwood dates back to ancient Egypt, and is mentioned in the Ebers Papyrus, c. 1550 BC. Wormwood extracts and wine-soaked wormwood leaves were used as remedies by the ancient Greeks. Moreover, there is evidence of the existence of a wormwood-flavoured wine, absinthites oinos, in ancient Greece.[12]
The first clear evidence of absinthe in the modern sense of a distilled spirit containing green anise and fennel, however, dates to the 18th century. According to popular legend, absinthe began as an all-purpose patent remedy created by Dr. Pierre Ordinaire, a French doctor living in Couvet, Switzerland, around 1792 (the exact date varies by account). Ordinaire's recipe was passed on to the Henriod sisters of Couvet, who sold absinthe as a medicinal elixir. By other accounts, the Henriod sisters may have been making the elixir before Ordinaire's arrival. In either case, a certain Major Dubied acquired the formula from the sisters and in 1797, and with his son Marcellin and son-in-law Henry-Louis Pernod, opened the first absinthe distillery, Dubied Père et Fils, in Couvet. In 1805, they built a second distillery in Pontarlier, France, under the new company name Maison Pernod Fils.[13] Pernod Fils remained one of the most popular brands of absinthe up until the drink was banned in France in 1914.

Absinthe's popularity grew steadily through the 1840s, when absinthe was given to French troops as a malaria preventive.[14] When the troops returned home, they brought their taste for absinthe home with them. The custom of drinking absinthe gradually became so popular in bars, bistros, cafés, and cabarets that, by the 1860s, the hour of 5 p.m. was called l'heure verte ("the green hour"). Absinthe was favoured by all social classes, from the wealthy bourgeoisie, to poor artists and ordinary working-class people. By the 1880s, mass production had caused the price of absinthe to drop sharply. By 1910, the French were drinking 36 million litres of absinthe per year, as compared to their annual consumption of almost 5 billion litres of wine.[15][16]
Absinthe was exported widely from its native France and Switzerland, and attained some degree of popularity in other countries, including Spain, Great Britain, USA, and the Czech Republic. Absinthe was never banned in Spain or Portugal, and its production and consumption have never ceased. It gained a temporary spike in popularity there during the early 20th century, corresponding with the French influenced Art Nouveau and Modernism aesthetic movements.[17]
New Orleans has a profound cultural association with absinthe, and is credited as the birthplace of the Sazerac, perhaps the earliest absinthe cocktail. The Old Absinthe House bar, located on Bourbon Street, serves as a prominent historical landmark. Originally named The Absinthe Room, it was opened in 1874 by a Catalan bartender named Cayetano Ferrer. The building was frequented by many famous people, including Mark Twain, Oscar Wilde, Franklin Roosevelt, Aleister Crowley and Frank Sinatra.[18][19]
Absinthe has been consumed in the Czech Republic (then part of Austria–Hungary) since at least 1888, notably by Czech artists, some of whom had an affinity for Paris, frequenting Prague's famous Cafe Slavia. Its wider appeal in Bohemia itself is uncertain, though it was sold in and around Prague. It is claimed that at least one local liquor distillery in Bohemia was producing absinthe at the turn of the 20th century.[unreliable source?][20]
Spurred by the temperance movement and the winemakers' associations, absinthe was publicly associated with violent crimes and social disorder.
One critic claimed:[21]
Absinthe makes you crazy and criminal, provokes epilepsy and tuberculosis, and has killed thousands of French people. It makes a ferocious beast of man, a martyr of woman, and a degenerate of the infant, it disorganizes and ruins the family and menaces the future of the country.
Edgar Degas' 1876 painting L'Absinthe, which can be seen at the Musée d'Orsay, epitomized the popular view of absinthe addicts as sodden and benumbed. Although Émile Zola mentioned absinthe only once by name, he described its effects in his novel L'Assommoir.[22]

A poster criticizes the ban on absinthe in Switzerland (by Albert Gantner, 1910)
In 1905, it was reported that Jean Lanfray, a Swiss farmer, murdered his family and attempted to take his own life after drinking absinthe. The fact that Lanfray was an alcoholic who had consumed considerable quantities of wine and brandy prior to drinking two glasses of absinthe was conveniently overlooked or ignored, therefore placing the blame for the murders solely on absinthe.[23] The Lanfray murders would prove to be the tipping point in this hotly debated topic, and a subsequent petition to ban absinthe in Switzerland collected more than 82,000 signatures. A referendum was subsequently held on banning the drink on 5 July 1908.[24] After it was approved by voters,[24] the prohibition of absinthe was then written into the Swiss constitution.
In 1906, both Belgium and Brazil banned the sale and distribution of absinthe, although these were not the first countries to take such action. Absinthe had been banned as early as 1898 in the colony of the Congo Free State.[25] The Netherlands banned absinthe in 1909, Switzerland in 1910,[26] the United States in 1912, and France in 1914.[26]
The prohibition of absinthe in France would eventually lead to the popularity of pastis, and to a lesser extent, ouzo, and other anise-flavoured spirits that do not contain wormwood. Following the conclusion of the First World War, production of the Pernod Fils brand was resumed at the Banus distillery in Catalonia, Spain (where absinthe was still legal),[27][28] but gradually declining sales saw the cessation of production in the 1960s.[29] In Switzerland, the ban served only to drive the production of absinthe underground. Clandestine home distillers produced colourless absinthe (la Bleue), which was easier to conceal from the authorities. Many countries never banned absinthe, notably Britain, where it had never been as popular as in continental Europe.
In the 1990s, upon realizing the UK had never formally banned absinthe, British importer BBH Spirits began to import Hill's Absinth from the Czech Republic, which sparked a modern resurgence in absinthe's popularity. It is in these countries, where absinthe was never banned or truly popular, where absinthe first began to reappear during the revival in the 1990s. The absinthes that were available during that time consisted almost exclusively of Czech, Spanish, and Portuguese brands that were of recent origin, typically consisting of Bohemian-style products, and considered by absinthe connoisseurs to be of inferior quality and not representative of the 19th century spirit.[30][31][32][33]
In 2000, La Fée Absinthe became the first commercial absinthe distilled and bottled in France since the 1914 ban.[34][35][36][37][38] Originally produced for export, it is now one of dozens of French absinthes that are produced and sold within France.

In the Netherlands, the restrictions on the manufacture and sale of absinthe were successfully challenged by the Amsterdam wine seller Menno Boorsma in July 2004, thus confirming the legality of absinthe once again. Similarly, Belgium lifted its longstanding absinthe ban on January 1, 2005, citing (as did the Dutch judge) a conflict with the adopted food and beverage regulations of the Single European Market. In Switzerland, the constitutional ban on absinthe was repealed in 2000 during an overhaul of the national constitution, although the prohibition was simultaneously rewritten into ordinary law instead. That law was later repealed such that as of March 1, 2005, absinthe was made again legal in its country of origin. Absinthe is once again distilled and sold in its Val-de-Travers birthplace, with Kübler and La Clandestine Absinthe among the first new brands to re-emerge.
Absinthe has a deep history in the Northern Catalan region of Spain that encompasses Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida, and the region of the Pyrenees mountains. While the drink was never officially banned in Spain, it began to fall out of favour in the 1940s, and almost vanished into obscurity. The Catalan region has seen significant resurgence since 2007, when one producer established operations there.
Absinthe has never been illegal to import or manufacture in Australia.[citation needed] Importation requires a permit under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulation 1956 due to a restriction on importing any product containing "oil of wormwood".[39] In 2000, an amendment proposed by Foods Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) as part of a new consolidation of the Food Code across Australia and New Zealand, made all wormwood species prohibited herbs for food purposes under Food Standard 1.4.4. Prohibited and Restricted Plants and Fungi. However, this amendment was found to be inconsistent with other parts of the preexisting Food Code.[40][41] The proposed amendment was withdrawn in 2002 during the transition between the two codes, thereby continuing to allow absinthe manufacture and importation through the existing permit-based system. These events were erroneously reported by the media as Australia having reclassified it from a prohibited product to a restricted product.[42] There is now an Australian-produced brand of absinthe called Moulin Rooz.
In 2007, the French Lucid brand became the first genuine absinthe to receive a COLA (Certificate of Label Approval) for importation into the United States since 1912,[43][44] following independent efforts by representatives from Lucid and Kübler to topple the long-standing U.S. ban.[45] In December 2007, St. George Absinthe Verte, produced by St. George Spirits of Alameda, California, became the first brand of American-made absinthe produced in the United States since the ban.[46][47] Since that time, other micro-distilleries have started producing small batch artisanal absinthes in the US.
The 21st Century has seen new modalities for absinthe, including various frozen preparations, which have become increasingly popular.[48][49][50][51]
In May 2011 the French Absinthe Ban of 1915 was repealed[52] following petitions by the Fédération Française des Spiritueux, who represent French distillers.

Most countries have no legal definition for absinthe, whereas the method of production and content of spirits such as Scotch whisky, brandy, and gin are globally defined and regulated. As such, producers are at liberty to label a product as "absinthe" or "absinth" without regard to any specific legal definition or quality standards.
Producers of legitimate absinthes employ one of two historically defined processes to create the finished spirit: distillation, or cold mixing. In the sole country (Switzerland) that does possess a legal definition of absinthe, distillation is the only permitted method of production.[53]
Distilled absinthe employs a method of production similar to that of high quality gin. Botanicals are initially macerated in distilled base alcohol before being redistilled to exclude bitter principles, and impart the desired complexity and texture to the spirit.


Absinthe distillation, ca. 1904
The distillation of absinthe first yields a colourless distillate that leaves the alembic at around 72% ABV. The distillate may be reduced and bottled clear, to produce a Blanche or la Bleue absinthe, or it may be coloured to create a verte using natural or artificial colouring.
Traditional absinthes obtain their green colour strictly from the chlorophyll of whole herbs, which is extracted from the plants during the secondary maceration. This step involves steeping plants such as petite wormwood, hyssop, and melissa (among other herbs) in the distillate. Chlorophyll from these herbs is extracted in the process, giving the drink its famous green colour. This step also provides a herbal complexity that is typical of high quality absinthe. The natural colouring process is considered critical for absinthe aging, since the chlorophyll remains chemically active. The chlorophyll serves a similar role in absinthe that tannins do in wine or brown liquors.[unreliable source?][54] After the colouring process, the resulting product is diluted with water to the desired percentage of alcohol. The flavour of absinthe is said to improve materially with storage, and many preban distilleries aged their absinthe in settling tanks before bottling.
Many modern absinthes are produced using a cold mix process. This method of production is much less costly than distillation, and is regarded as inferior in the same way that compound gin is regarded as inferior to distilled gin. The cold mixing process involves the simple blending of flavouring essences and artificial colouring in strong alcohol, in similar fashion to most flavoured vodkas and inexpensive liqueurs. The lack of a formal legal definition of absinthe in most countries enables some cold mixing producers to falsely claim their products as "distilled", since the base alcohol itself was created through distillation. This is used as justification to sell these inexpensively produced absinthes at prices comparable to more authentic absinthes that are distilled directly from whole herbs. In the only country that possesses a formal legal definition of absinthe (Switzerland), anything made via the cold mixed process cannot be sold as absinthe.


Anise seeds
Absinthe is traditionally prepared from a distillation of neutral alcohol, various herbs, spices and water. Traditional absinthes were redistilled from a white grape spirit (or eau de vie), while lesser absinthes were more commonly made from alcohol from grain, beets, or potatoes.[55] The principal botanicals are grande wormwood, green anise, and florence fennel, which are often called "the holy trinity."[56] Many other herbs may be used as well, such as petite wormwood (Artemisia pontica or Roman wormwood), hyssop, melissa, star anise, angelica, peppermint, coriander, and veronica.[57]
Adding to absinthe's negative reputation in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, unscrupulous makers of the drink omitted the traditional colouring phase of production in favour of adding toxic copper salts to artificially induce a green tint. This practice may be responsible for some of the alleged toxicity historically associated with this beverage. Many modern day producers resort to similar shortcuts, including the use of artificial food colouring to create the green colour. Additionally, at least some cheaply made preban absinthes were reported to be adulterated with poisonous antimony trichloride, which was reputedly added to enhance the louching effect.[58]
Absinthe may also be naturally coloured red using hibiscus flowers. This was referred to as a rouge or rose absinthe. Only one historical rouge brand is reported to have existed.[unreliable source?][59]
Absinthe was historically bottled at 45-74% percent ABV. Some modern Franco–Suisse absinthes are bottled at up to 82.3% ABV,[60] while some modern cold-mixed, bohemian-style absinthes are bottled at up to 89.9% ABV.
The modern day interest in absinthe has spawned a rash of "absinthe kits", which are claimed to produce homemade absinthe. Kits often call for soaking herbs in vodka or alcohol, and/or adding a liquid concentrate to the same in order to create an ersatz absinthe. Such practices usually yield a harsh substance that bears little resemblance to the genuine article, and are considered to be inauthentic by any practical standard.[61] Some concoctions may even be dangerous, especially if they call for supplementation with potentially poisonous herbs, oils and/or extracts. At least one documented case exists in which a person suffered acute renal failure after drinking 10 ml of pure wormwood oil, a dose much higher than that found in absinthe.[62]
In baking, Pernod Anise is often used as a substitute if absinthe is unavailable.[63] In preparing the classic New Orleans-style Sazerac cocktail, various substitutes such as Pastis, Pernod, Ricard, and Herbsaint have been used to replace absinthe.[64]

Preparing absinthe using the traditional method, which does not involve burning.


Absinthe spoons are designed to perch a sugar cube atop the glass, over which ice-cold water is dripped to dilute the absinthe. The lip near the centre of the handle allows the spoon to rest securely on the rim of the glass.
Traditionally, absinthe is prepared by placing a sugar cube on top of a specially designed slotted spoon, and then placing the spoon on the glass which has been filled with a measure of absinthe. Iced water is then poured or dripped over the sugar cube in a manner whereby the water is slowly and evenly displaced into the absinthe, such that the final preparation contains 1 part absinthe and 3-5 parts water. As water dilutes the spirit, those components with poor water solubility (mainly those from anise, fennel, and star anise) come out of solution and cloud the drink. The resulting milky opalescence is called the louche (Fr. "opaque" or "shady", IPA [luʃ]). The release of these dissolved essences coincides with a perfuming of herbal aromas and flavours that "blossom" or "bloom", and brings out subtleties that are otherwise muted within the neat spirit. This reflects what is perhaps the oldest and purest method of preparation, and is often referred to as the French Method.
The Bohemian Method is a recent invention that involves fire, and was not performed during absinthe's peak of popularity in the Belle Époque. Like the French method, a sugar cube is placed on a slotted spoon over a glass containing one shot of absinthe. The sugar is pre-soaked in alcohol (usually more absinthe), then set ablaze. The flaming sugar cube is then dropped into the glass, thus igniting the absinthe. Finally, a shot glass of water is added to douse the flames. This method tends to produce a stronger drink than the French method. A variant of the Bohemian Method involves allowing the fire to extinguish on its own. This variant, sometimes referred to as "Cooking the Absinthe" or "Flaming Green Fairy," destroys most of the alcohol. The origin of this burning ritual may borrow from a coffee and brandy drink that was served at Café Brûlot, in which a sugar cube soaked in brandy was set aflame.[58] Most experienced absintheurs do not recommend the Bohemian Method and consider it a modern gimmick, as it can destroy the absinthe flavor and present a fire hazard due to the unusually high alcohol content present in absinthe.[65]


Slowly dripping ice water from an absinthe fountain
In 19th century Parisian cafés, upon receiving an order for an absinthe, a waiter would present the patron with a dose of absinthe in a suitable glass, sugar, absinthe spoon, and a carafe of iced water.[66] It was up to the patron to prepare the drink, as the inclusion or omission of sugar was strictly an individual preference, as was the amount of water used. As the popularity of the drink increased, additional accoutrements of preparation appeared, including the absinthe fountain, which was effectively a large jar of iced water with spigots, mounted on a lamp base. This allowed a number of drinks to be prepared at once, and with a hands-free drip, patrons were able to socialize while louching a glass.
Although many bars served absinthe in standard glassware, a number of glasses were specifically designed for the French absinthe preparation ritual. Absinthe glasses were typically fashioned with a dose line, bulge, or bubble in the lower portion denoting how much absinthe should be poured. One "dose" of absinthe ranged anywhere from around 1-1.5 fluid ounces (30-45 ml).
In addition to being prepared with sugar and water, absinthe emerged as a popular cocktail ingredient in both the United Kingdom and the United States. By 1930, dozens of fancy cocktails that called for absinthe had been published in numerous credible bartender guides.[67] One of the most famous of these libations is Ernest Hemingway's "Death in the Afternoon" cocktail, a tongue-in-cheek concoction contributed to a 1935 collection of celebrity recipes. The directions are as follows: "Pour one jigger absinthe into a Champagne glass. Add iced Champagne until it attains the proper opalescent milkiness. Drink three to five of these slowly."[68]



The Absinthe Drinker by Viktor Oliva (1861–1928)
Most categorical alcoholic beverages have regulations governing their classification and labelling, while those governing absinthe have always been conspicuously lacking. According to popular treatises from the 19th century, absinthe could be loosely categorized into several grades (ordinaire, demi-fine, fine, and Suisse—the latter does not denote origin), in order of increasing alcoholic strength and quality. Many contemporary absinthe critics simply classify absinthe as distilled or mixed, according to its production method. And while the former is generally considered far superior in quality to the latter, an absinthe's simple claim of being 'distilled' makes no guarantee as to the quality of its base ingredients or the skill of its maker.
Blanche, or la Bleue: Blanche absinthe (also referred to as la Bleue in Switzerland) is bottled directly following distillation and reduction, and is uncoloured (clear). The name la Bleue was originally a term used for bootleg Swiss absinthe, but has become a popular term for post-ban-style Swiss absinthe in general.
Verte ("green" in French) absinthe begins as a blanche. The blanche is altered by the colouring step, by which a separate mixture of herbs is steeped into the clear distillate. This confers a peridot green hue and an intense flavour. Vertes represent the prevailing type of absinthe that was found in the 19th century. Artificially coloured green absinthes may also claimed to be "verte", though they lack the characteristic herbal flavours that result from the colouring process.
Absenta ("absinthe" in Spanish) is sometimes associated with a regional style that often differed slightly from its French cousin. Traditional absentas may taste slightly different due to their use of Alicante anise,[unreliable source?][69] and often exhibit a characteristic citrus flavour.[unreliable source?][70]
Hausgemacht (German for home-made, often abbreviated as HG) refers to clandestine absinthe (not be confused with the Swiss La Clandestine brand) that is home-distilled by hobbyists. It should not be confused with absinthe kits. Hausgemacht absinthe is produced in tiny quantities for personal use and not for the commercial market. Clandestine production increased after absinthe was banned, when small producers went underground, most notably in Switzerland. Although the ban has been lifted in Switzerland, some clandestine distillers have not legitimised their production. Authorities believe that high taxes on alcohol and the mystique of being underground are likely reasons.[71]
Bohemian-style absinth is also referred to as Czech-style absinthe, anise-free absinthe, or just "absinth" (without the "e"), and is best described as a wormwood bitters. It is produced mainly in the Czech Republic,[72] from which it gets its designation as Bohemian or Czech, although not all absinthes from the Czech Republic are Bohemian-style. Bohemian-style absinth typically contains little or none of the anise, fennel, and other herbal flavours associated with traditional absinthe, and thus bears very little resemblance to the absinthes made popular in the 19th century. Typical Bohemian-style absinth has only two similarities with its authentic, traditional counterpart: it contains wormwood and has a high alcohol content. The Czechs are credited with inventing the fire ritual in the 1990s, possibly because Czech absinth does not louche, which renders the traditional French preparation method useless. As such, this type of absinthe and the fire ritual associated with it are entirely modern fabrications, and have little to no relationship with the historical absinthe tradition.[73]

Absinthe that is artificially coloured or clear is aesthetically stable, and can be bottled in clear glass. If naturally coloured absinthe is exposed to light or air for a prolonged period, the chlorophyll gradually becomes oxidized, which has the effect of gradually changing the colour from green to yellow green, and eventually to brown. The colour of absinthe that has completed this transition was historically referred to as feuille morte (dead leaf). In the preban era, this natural phenomenon was favourably viewed, for it confirmed the product in question was coloured naturally, and not artificially with potentially toxic chemicals. Predictably, vintage absinthes often emerge from sealed bottles as distinctly amber in tint due to decades of slow oxidation. Though this colour change presents no adverse impact to the flavour of absinthe, it is generally desired to preserve the original colour, which requires that naturally coloured absinthe be bottled in dark, light resistant bottles. Absinthe intended for decades of storage should be kept in a cool (room temperature), dry place, away from light and heat. Absinthe should not be stored in the refrigerator or freezer, as the anethole may polymerize inside the bottle, creating an irreversible precipitate, and adversely impacting the original flavour.



Édouard Manet, The Absinthe Drinker, 1859
Absinthe has been frequently and improperly described in modern times as being hallucinogenic. This is at least partly rooted in the fact that following some ten years of experiments with wormwood oil in the 19th century, the French psychiatrist Valentin Magnan studied 250 cases of alcoholism, and claimed that those who drank absinthe were worse off than those drinking ordinary alcohol, having experienced rapid-onset hallucinations.[74] Such accounts by opponents of absinthe (like Magnan) were cheerfully embraced by famous absinthe drinkers, many of whom were bohemian artists or writers.[75]
Two famous artists who helped popularize the notion that absinthe had powerful psychoactive properties were Toulouse-Lautrec and Vincent van Gogh. In one of the best-known written accounts of absinthe drinking, an inebriated Oscar Wilde described a phantom sensation of having tulips brush against his legs after leaving a bar at closing time.[76] Today it is known that absinthe does not cause hallucinations.[77] Thujone, once widely believed to be an active chemical in absinthe, is a GABA antagonist; and while it can produce muscle spasms in large doses, there is no direct evidence to suggest it causes hallucinations.[77] It has been speculated that reports of hallucinogenic effects of absinthe were most likely due to poisonous adulterants being added to cheaper versions of the drink in the 19th century.[78]
Notions of absinthe's alleged hallucinogenic properties were again fuelled in the 1970s, when a scientific paper suggested that thujone's structural similarity to THC, the active chemical in cannabis, presented the possibility of THC receptor affinity.[79][80] This theory was conclusively disproved in 1999.[81]
The debate over whether absinthe produces effects on the human mind in addition to those of alcohol has not been conclusively resolved. The effects of absinthe have been described by some as mind opening.[77] The most commonly reported experience is a 'clear-headed' feeling of inebriation — a form of 'lucid drunkenness'. Chemist, historian and absinthe distiller Ted Breaux has claimed that the alleged secondary effects of absinthe may be caused by the fact that some of the herbal compounds in the drink act as stimulants, while others act as sedatives, creating an overall lucid effect of awakening.[82] The long term effects of moderate absinthe consumption in humans remain unknown, although herbs traditionally used in the production of absinthe are reported to have both painkilling[83] and antiparasitic[84] properties.
It was once widely promoted that excessive absinthe drinking caused effects that were discernible from those associated with alcoholism, a belief that led to the coining of the term absinthism. One of the first vilifications of absinthe followed an 1864 experiment in which Magnan simultaneously exposed one guinea pig to large doses of pure wormwood vapour, and another to alcohol vapours. The guinea pig exposed to wormwood vapour experienced convulsive seizures, while the animal exposed to alcohol did not. Magnan would later blame the naturally occurring (in wormwood) chemical thujone for these effects.[85]
Past reports estimated thujone concentrations in absinthe as being up to 260 mg/kg.[86] More recently, published scientific analyses of samples of various original absinthes have disproved previous estimates, and demonstrated that only a trace of the thujone present in wormwood actually makes it into a properly distilled absinthe when historical methods and materials are employed to create the spirit. As such, most traditionally crafted absinthes, both vintage and modern, fall within the current EU standards.[87][88][89][90]
Tests conducted on mice to study toxicity showed an oral LD50 of about 45 mg thujone per kg of body weight,[91] which represents far more absinthe than could be realistically consumed. The high percentage of alcohol in absinthe would result in mortality long before thujone could become a factor.[91] In documented cases of acute thujone poisoning as a result of oral ingestion,[92] the source of thujone was not commercial absinthe, but rather non-absinthe related sources, such as common essential oils (which may contain as much as 50% thujone).[93]
One study published in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol[94] concluded that high doses (0.28 mg/kg) of thujone in alcohol had negative effects on attention performance in a clinical setting. It delayed reaction time, and caused subjects to concentrate their attention into the central field of vision. Low doses (0.028 mg/kg) did not produce an effect noticeably different from the plain alcohol control. While the effects of the high dose samples were statistically significant in a double blind test, the test subjects themselves were unable to reliably identify which samples were the ones containing thujone. For the average 65 kg man, the high dose samples in the study would equate to 18.2 mg of thujone. The EU limit of 35 mg/L of thujone in absinthe means that given the highest permitted thujone content, one would have to consume approximately 0.5 litres to reach the measured effects, a feat likely to cause alcohol poisoning.

Most countries (except Switzerland) presently do not possess a legal definition of absinthe (unlike Scotch whisky or cognac). Accordingly, producers are free to label a product 'absinthe' or 'absinth', whether or not it bears any resemblance to the traditional spirit.
Bitters may contain a maximum 35 mg/kg thujone, while other alcoholic beverages can contain a maximum 10 mg/kg.[95] In Australia, the import and sale of absinthe technically requires a special permit, although absinthe is readily available in many bottle shops. Regulation 5H of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (Cth)[96] (the Regulations) prohibits the importation of Absinthe (Schedule 8), unless the permission (in writing) of the Secretary or an authorised person has been granted permission to import the goods and the permission has been produced to the Collector. Item 12A of Schedule 8 of the Regulations,[97] refers to "oil of wormwood, being an essential oil obtained from plants of the genus Artemisia, and preparations containing oil of wormwood." The administrative arrangements include the Secretary and authorised officers (appropriately delegated TGA officers) of the Therapeutic Goods Administration[98] may grant permission to import absinthe. The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service is the Collector for the importation of Schedule 8 goods. The domestic production and sale of Absinthe is regulated by State licensing laws.
Absinthe was prohibited in Brazil until 1999 and was brought by entrepreneur Lalo Zanini and legalized in the same year. Presently, absinthe sold in Brazil must abide by the national law that restricts all spirits to a maximum of 54.0% ABV. While this regulation is enforced throughout channels of legal distribution, most major cities have large open air markets where contraband items, including absinthe containing alcohol in excess of the legal limit, are sold without interference from local police.

In Canada, liquor laws are established by the various provincial governments. As with any spirit, importation by individuals for personal use is allowed, provided that conditions for the individual's duration outside the country are satisfied. Importation is a federal matter, and is enforced by the Canada Border Services Agency.
British Columbia, New Brunswick: no established limits on thujone content
Alberta, Nova Scotia, Ontario: 10 mg/kg
Manitoba: 6–8 mg
Quebec: 15 mg/kg
Newfoundland and Labrador: absinthe sold in provincial liquor store outlets
Absinthe is not sold in some provinces, although in Saskatchewan, an individual is permitted to import one case (usually twelve 750 ml bottles or eight one-litre bottles) of any liquor. Individual provincial liquor boards must approve each product before it may be sold.
The production of spirits in Canada is provincially regulated. Okanagan Spirits in British Columbia released the Taboo brand in 2007, which is possibly the first commercial absinthe ever crafted in Canada.[99]
The European Union permits a maximum thujone level of 35 mg/kg in alcoholic beverages where Artemisia species is a listed ingredient, and 10 mg/kg in other alcoholic beverages.[100] Member countries regulate absinthe production within this framework. The sale of absinthe is permitted in all EU countries unless they further regulate it.
Despite adopting sweeping EU food and beverage regulations in 1988 that effectively re-legalised absinthe, a decree was passed that same year that preserved the prohibition on products explicitly labelled as "absinthe", while placing strict limits on fenchone (fennel) and pinocamphone (hyssop)[101] in an obvious, but failed, attempt to thwart a possible return of absinthe-like products. French producers circumvented this regulatory obstacle by labelling absinthe as spiritueux à base de plantes d'absinthe ('wormwood-based spirits'), with many either reducing or omitting fennel and hyssop altogether from their products. A legal challenge to the scientific basis of this decree resulted in its repeal (2009),[102] which opened the door for the official French re-legalisation of absinthe for the first time since 1915. The French Senate voted to repeal the prohibition in mid-April 2011.[103]
It is legal to produce and sell absinthe in the Republic of Georgia, which has claimed to possess several producers of absinthe.
A ban on absinthe was enacted in Germany on 27 March 1923. In addition to banning the production of and commercial trade in absinthe, the law went so far as to prohibit the distribution of printed matter that provided details of its production. The original ban was lifted in 1981, but the use of Artemisia absinthium as a flavouring agent remained prohibited. On 27 September 1991, Germany adopted the European Union's standards of 1988, which effectively re-legalised absinthe.[104] Unlike Switzerland and France, there are no further restrictions.
The Fascist regime in 1926 banned the production, import, transport and sale of any liquor named "Assenzio". The ban was reinforced in 1931 with harsher penalties for transgressors, and remained in force until 1992 when the Italian government amended its laws to comply with the EU directive 88/388/EEC.
Although absinthe is not prohibited at national level, some local authorities have banned it. The latest is Mataura in Southland. The ban came in August 2008 after several issues of misuse drew public and police attention. One incident resulted in breathing difficulties and hospitalization of a 17-year-old for alcohol poisoning.[105] The particular brand of absinthe that caused these effects was bottled at an unusually high 89.9% ABV.
The sale and production of absinthe has never been (except for the time under prohibition from 1919 to 1932) prohibited in Finland. The government-owned chain of liquor stores called Alko is the only outlet that may sell alcoholic beverages containing over 4.7% ABV. Also there is a law that bans the sale of alcoholic beverages containing over 60% ABV (though the possession is legal).
The sale and production of absinthe has never been prohibited in Sweden. However, the only outlet that may sell alcoholic beverages containing more than 3.5% ABV is the government-owned chain of liquor stores known as Systembolaget. Systembolaget did not import or sell absinthe for many years.[106]
In Switzerland, the sale and production of absinthe was prohibited from 1910 to 2005; the ban being lifted on March 1, 2005. To be legally made or sold in Switzerland, absinthe must be distilled,[107] must not contain commercial additives, and must be either naturally coloured or left uncoloured.[108]
In 2007, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) effectively lifted the longstanding absinthe ban, and has since approved many brands for sale in the U.S. market. This was made possible partly through the TTB's clarification of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) thujone content regulations, which specify that finished food and beverages that contain Artemisia species must be thujone free.[109] In this context, the TTB considers a product to be thujone-free if the thujone content is less than 10 ppm (equal to 10 mg/kg).[110][111] This is verified through the use of Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry.[112]
The importation, distribution, and sale of absinthe is permitted with respect to the following restrictions:
The product must be thujone-free as per TTB guidelines,
The word "absinthe" can neither be the brand name nor stand alone on the label, and
The packaging cannot "project images of hallucinogenic, psychotropic or mind-altering effects."
Absinthe imported in violation of these regulations is subject to seizure at the discretion of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.[113][114]
Beginning in 2001, a product called Absente was sold legally in the United States under the marketing tagline "Absinthe Refined," but as the product contained sugar, and was made with southernwood (Artemisia abrotanum) and not grande wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) (prior to 2009), the TTB classified it as a liqueur.
The Absinthe (Prohibition) Act 1915, passed in the New Hebrides, has never been repealed, is included in the 1988 Vanuatu consolidated legislation, and contains the following all-encompassing restriction: The manufacture, importation, circulation and sale wholesale or by retail of absinthe or similar liquors in Vanuatu shall be prohibited.[115]

Main article: Cultural references to absinthe
The legacy of absinthe as a mysterious, addictive, and mind-altering drink continues to this day. Absinthe has served as the subject of numerous works of fine art, films, video, music and literature since the mid-19th century.
Numerous artists and writers living in France in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were noted absinthe drinkers who featured absinthe in their work. These included Émile Zola,[citation needed] Vincent van Gogh, Édouard Manet, Amedeo Modigliani, Arthur Rimbaud, Guy de Maupassant, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Paul Verlaine. Later artists and writers drew from this cultural well, including Pablo Picasso, August Strindberg, Oscar Wilde, and Ernest Hemingway. Aleister Crowley was also known to be a habitual absinthe drinker. Émile Cohl, an early pioneer in the art of animation, presented the effects of the drink in 1920 with the short film, Hasher's Delirium.
The aura of illicitness and mystery surrounding absinthe has played into modern literature, movies, music and television. Such depictions vary in their authenticity, often applying dramatic license to depict the drink as a flaming green neon liquid that ranges from an aphrodisiac to poison, and always seems to be a catalyst of vivid hallucinations.

Ancient Greek painting in a vase, showing a physician (iatros) bleeding a patient
Bloodletting (or blood-letting) is the withdrawal of often small quantities of blood from a patient to cure or prevent illness and disease. Bloodletting was based on an ancient system of medicine in which blood and other bodily fluid were regarded as "humors" that had to remain in proper balance to maintain health. It was the most common medical practice performed by physicians from antiquity until the late 19th century, a span of almost 2,000 years.[1] The practice has now been abandoned for all except a few very specific conditions.[2] It is conceivable that historically, in the absence of other treatments for hypertension, bloodletting could sometimes have had a beneficial effect in temporarily reducing blood pressure by reducing blood volume.[3] However, since hypertension is very often asymptomatic and thus undiagnosable without modern methods, this effect was unintentional. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the historical use of bloodletting was harmful to patients.[4]
Today, the term phlebotomy refers to the drawing of blood for laboratory analysis or blood transfusion (see Phlebotomy (modern)).[5] Therapeutic phlebotomy refers to the drawing of a unit of blood in specific cases like hemochromatosis, polycythemia vera, porphyria cutanea tarda, etc., to reduce the amount of red blood cells.[6][7]

Points for blood-letting, Hans von Gersdorff (surgeon), Field book of wound medicine, 1517
Earliest descriptions of bloodletting is available in Ancient Ayurvedic Texts, wherein detailed, systematic, scientific modes of bloodletting are cited. Bloodletting is one of the oldest medical techniques, having been practiced among ancient peoples including the Mesopotamians, the Egyptians, and the Greeks.[3] In Greece, bloodletting was in use in the fifth century B.C. during the lifetime of Hippocrates, who mentions this practice but generally relied on dietary techniques.[8] Erasistratus, however, theorized that many diseases were caused by plethoras, or overabundances, in the blood and advised that these plethoras be treated, initially, by exercise, sweating, reduced food intake, and vomiting.[9] Herophilus advocated bloodletting. Archagathus, one of the first Greek physicians to practice in Rome, also believed in the value of bloodletting.
"Bleeding" a patient to health was modeled on the process of menstruation. Hippocrates believed that menstruation functioned to "purge women of bad humors". During the Roman Empire, the Greek physician Galen, who subscribed to the teachings of Hippocrates, advocated physician-initiated bloodletting.[10]
The popularity of bloodletting in the classical Mediterranean world was reinforced by the ideas of Galen, after he discovered that not only veins but also arteries were filled with blood, not air as was commonly believed at the time. There were two key concepts in his system of bloodletting. The first was that blood was created and then used up; it did not circulate, and so it could "stagnate" in the extremities. The second was that humoral balance was the basis of illness or health, the four humours being blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile, relating to the four Greek classical elements of air, water, earth and fire respectively. Galen believed that blood was the dominant humour and the one in most need of control. In order to balance the humours, a physician would either remove "excess" blood (plethora) from the patient or give them an emetic to induce vomiting, or a diuretic to induce urination.
Galen created a complex system of how much blood should be removed based on the patient's age, constitution, the season, the weather and the place. Symptoms of plethora were believed to include fever, apoplexy, and headache. The blood to be let was of a specific nature determined by the disease: either arterial or venous, and distant or close to the area of the body affected. He linked different blood vessels with different organs, according to their supposed drainage. For example, the vein in the right hand would be let for liver problems and the vein in the left hand for problems with the spleen. The more severe the disease, the more blood would be let. Fevers required copious amounts of bloodletting.
The Talmud recommended a specific day of the week and days of the month for bloodletting, and similar rules, though less codified, can be found among Christian writings advising which saints' days were favourable for bloodletting. Islamic medical authors too advised bloodletting, particularly for fevers. The practice was probably passed to them by the Greeks; when Islamic theories became known in the Latin-speaking countries of Europe, bloodletting became more widespread. Together with cautery, it was central to Arabic surgery; the key texts Kitab al-Qanun and especially Al-Tasrif li-man 'ajaza 'an al-ta'lif both recommended it. It was also known in Ayurvedic medicine, described in the Susruta Samhita.

Even after the humoral system fell into disuse, the practice was continued by surgeons and barber-surgeons. Though the bloodletting was often recommended by physicians, it was carried out by barbers. This division of labour led to the distinction between physicians and surgeons. The red-and-white-striped pole of the barbershop, still in use today, is derived from this practice: the red represents the blood being drawn, the white represents the tourniquet used, and the pole itself represents the stick squeezed in the patient's hand to dilate the veins. Bloodletting was used to "treat" a wide range of diseases, becoming a standard treatment for almost every ailment, and was practiced prophylactically as well as therapeutically.

The benefits of bloodletting only began to be seriously questioned in the second half of the 1800s. While many physicians in England at the time had lost faith in the general value of bloodletting, some still considered it beneficial in some circumstances, for instance to "clear out" infected or weakened blood or its ability to "cause hæmorrhages to cease"—as evidenced in a call for a "fair trial for blood-letting as a remedy" in 1871.[11] Bloodletting persisted into the 20th century and was even recommended by Sir William Osler in the 1923 edition of his textbook The Principles and Practice of Medicine.[12]
A number of different methods were employed. The most common was phlebotomy, or venesection (often called "breathing a vein"), in which blood was drawn from one or more of the larger external veins, such as those in the forearm or neck. In arteriotomy, an artery was punctured, although generally only in the temples. In scarification (not to be confused with scarification, a method of body modification), the "superficial" vessels were attacked, often using a syringe, a spring-loaded lancet, or a glass cup that contained heated air, producing a vacuum within (see fire cupping). There was also a specific bloodletting tool called a scarificator, used primarily in 19th century medicine. It has a spring-loaded mechanism with gears that snaps the blades out through slits in the front cover and back in, in a circular motion. The case is cast brass, and the mechanism and blades steel. One knife bar gear has slipped teeth, turning the blades in a different direction than those on the other bars. The last photo and the diagram show the depth adjustment bar at the back and sides.

Leeches could also be used. The withdrawal of so much blood as to induce syncope (fainting) was considered beneficial, and many sessions would only end when the patient began to swoon.
William Harvey disproved the basis of the practice in 1628, and the introduction of scientific medicine, la méthode numérique, allowed Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis to demonstrate that phlebotomy was entirely ineffective in the treatment of pneumonia and various fevers in the 1830s. Nevertheless, in 1840, a lecturer at the Royal College of Physicians would still state that "blood-letting is a remedy which, when judiciously employed, it is hardly possible to estimate too highly",[13] and Louis was dogged by the sanguinary Broussais, who could recommend leeches fifty at a time.
Bloodletting was used to treat almost every disease. One British medical text recommended bloodletting for acne, asthma, cancer, cholera, coma, convulsions, diabetes, epilepsy, gangrene, gout, herpes, indigestion, insanity, jaundice, leprosy, ophthalmia, plague, pneumonia, scurvy, smallpox, stroke, tetanus, tuberculosis, and for some one hundred other diseases. Bloodletting was even used to treat most forms of hemorrhaging such as nosebleed, excessive menstruation, or hemorrhoidal bleeding. Before surgery or at the onset of childbirth, blood was removed to prevent inflammation. Before amputation, it was customary to remove a quantity of blood equal to the amount believed to circulate in the limb that was to be removed.[14]
Leeches became especially popular in the early nineteenth century. In the 1830s, the French imported about forty million leeches a year for medical purposes, and in the next decade, England imported six million leeches a year from France alone. Through the early decades of the century, hundreds of millions of leeches were used by physicians throughout Europe.[15]
One typical course of medical treatment began the morning of 13 July 1824. A French sergeant was stabbed through the chest while engaged in single combat; within minutes, he fainted from loss of blood. Arriving at the local hospital he was immediately bled twenty ounces (570 ml) "to prevent inflammation". During the night he was bled another 24 ounces (680 ml). Early the next morning, the chief surgeon bled the patient another 10 ounces (285 ml); during the next 14 hours, he was bled five more times. Medical attendants thus intentionally removed more than half of the patient's normal blood supply—in addition to the initial blood loss which caused the sergeant to faint. Bleedings continued over the next several days. By 29 July, the wound had become inflamed. The physician applied 32 leeches to the most sensitive part of the wound. Over the next three days, there were more bleedings and a total of 40 more leeches. The sergeant recovered and was discharged on 3 October. His physician wrote that "by the large quantity of blood lost, amounting to 170 ounces [nearly eleven pints] (4.8 liters), besides that drawn by the application of leeches [perhaps another two pints] (1.1 liters), the life of the patient was preserved". By nineteenth-century standards, thirteen pints of blood taken over the space of a month was a large but not an exceptional quantity. The medical literature of the period contains many similar accounts-some successful, some not.[16]
Bloodletting was also popular in the young United States of America, where Benjamin Rush (a signatory of the Declaration of Independence) saw the state of the arteries as the key to disease, recommending levels of bloodletting that were high even for the time. George Washington asked to be bled heavily after he developed a throat infection from weather exposure. Within a ten hour period, a total of 124-126 ounces (3.75 liters) of blood was withdrawn prior to his death from a throat infection in 1799.[17]


Bloodsticks for use when bleeding animals
One reason for the continued popularity of bloodletting (and purging) was that, while anatomical knowledge, surgical and diagnostic skills increased tremendously in Europe from the 17th century, the key to curing disease remained elusive, and the underlying belief was that it was better to give any treatment than nothing at all. The psychological benefit of bloodletting to the patient (a placebo effect) may sometimes have outweighed the physiological problems it caused. Bloodletting slowly lost favour during the 19th century, but a number of other ineffective or harmful treatments were available as placebos—mesmerism, various processes involving the new technology of electricity, many potions, tonics, and elixirs.
In the absence of other treatments, bloodletting actually is beneficial in some circumstances, including hemochromatosis, the fluid overload of heart failure, and possibly simply to reduce blood pressure. In other cases, such as those involving agitation, the reduction in blood pressure might appear beneficial due to the sedative effects. In 1844, Joseph Pancoast listed the advantages of bloodletting in "A Treatise on Operative Surgery". Not all of these reasons are outrageous nowadays:
The opening of the superficial vessels for the purpose of extracting blood constitutes one of the most common operations of the practitioner. The principal results, which we effect by it, are 1st. The diminution of the mass of the blood, by which the overloaded capillary or larger vessels of some affected part may be relieved; 2. The modification of the force and frequency of the heart's action; 3. A change in the composition of the blood, rendering it less stimulating; the proportion of serum becoming increased after bleeding, in consequence of its being reproduced with greater facility than the other elements of the blood; 4. The production of syncope, for the purpose of effecting a sudden general relaxation of the system; and, 5. The derivation, or drawing as it is alleged, of the force of the circulation from some of the internal organs, towards the open outlet of the superficial vessel. These indications may be fulfilled by opening either a vein or an artery.

Main article: Phlebotomy (modern)
Today it is well established that bloodletting is not effective for most diseases. Indeed it is mostly harmful, since it can weaken the patient and facilitate infections. Bloodletting is used today in the treatment of a few diseases, including hemochromatosis and polycythemia; however, these rare diseases were unknown and undiagnosable before the advent of scientific medicine. It is practiced by specifically trained practitioners in hospitals, using modern techniques. In most cases, phlebotomy now refers to the removal of small quantities of blood for diagnostic purposes. However, in the case of hemochromatosis, which is now recognized as the most common genetic, or inherited, disorder, frequent bloodletting has become an essential, and life-saving procedure.[citation needed]

Though bloodletting as a general health measure has been shown to be harmful, it is still commonly indicated and used for a wide variety of conditions in the Ayurvedic, Unani, and traditional Chinese systems of alternative medicine.[18][19][20][21][22][23][24] Unani is based on a form of humorism, and so in that system, bloodletting is used to correct supposed humoral imbalance.

            <Text>“I thought you said you suspected Dr. Allen,” he said, mouth still full of candy.
He was looking at Connor’s body. It was clear why they thought of Dr. Allen. Lord Connor was standing in the center of the room, a disturbing tableau of grotesquerie. A monstrous automaton of rotting flesh and clockwork, pivoting his animatronic neck with a hiss of steam. His legs, surgically removed after his death, had been replaced with the taxidermic tentacles of an octopus. His arms were his own, but they were in pieces, connected by copper pipes and brass cogs. Beneath his flayed chest, a clock ticked. Roderick rolled his eyes as Connor raised a hand and waved, his movements surprisingly fluid.
“How pedestrian,” he said with a derisive snort.
“We do suspect Allen,” Taggert protested. “Why should we not? This is evidently his handiwork.”
Roderick laughed until it turned into a cough.
“Sorry,” he said, suddenly serious. “But no. Did, um…Did Connor say anything when you first came across him?”
Taggert looked at one of his officers meaningfully. The man drew out a notepad and stalked over to Taggert’s side. He flipped through the notepad, licking his fingers to facilitate the turning of its pages. He stopped when he’d found the one he wanted.
“‘Other friends have flown before; on the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.’ Then the bird said,” the officer began.
“Nevermore?” said Roderick, not even letting him finish.
“Yes,” said one of the police officers, a moustachioed man who was examining the documents on Connor’s desk. “It’s from The Raven, by Edgar Allen Poe. I recognised it straight away.”
“Oh, really?” Roderick said, with exaggerated enthusiasm. “Edgar Allen Poe?” he repeated as though it was the first time he’d heard the name.
The policeman nodded, not grasping the sarcasm.
“Right. So, definitely not Dr. Allen’s work then, is it?” said Roderick.
Taggert snorted. “And why not?”
“Well, for one, it’s a bit too obvious, isn’t it?” Roderick replied. “You do know that Dr. Allen was a member of the Resurrectionists, don’t you?”
“Yes, of course.”
“And you do know that the crow is their sigil?”
“Yes,” Taggert said again.
“So, The Raven?” Roderick said with a laugh. “Hardly subtle, is it?”
“Since when is Dr. Allen known for his subtlety?” Taggert wanted to know.
“If you had done your research on Dr. Allen, you’d know that he is the obsessively compulsive sort of psychopath. Detail oriented to a tee,” Roderick replied.   He pointed at Connor’s body. “Whoever did this was obviously familiar with Allen’s work and had both a surgeon’s precision and a talent for engineering. He might even have been a student of Allen’s. But this only serves to confirm my suspicions with the Grimmer killing. The engineering is beyond Dr. Allen’s skill, while the surgery is below his skill level. Whoever killed Lord Connor is the same man that killed Charles Grimmer. Not Dr. Allen.”
Taggert cringed. That was still a point of contention. Roderick insisted that Charles Grimmer had been killed by an impostor, and refused to listen to reason.
“Mr. Steen,” Taggert began, “You are leaping to conclusions. Are we to rule out Dr. Allen as a suspect simply because you think this diorama lacks the artistic integrity of his usual work?”</Text>

            <Synopsis>Annabel takes a bath and reflects on her kiss with Jonathan. She feels uncomfortable with his wealth, given her modest upbringing. She emerges, dressed in clothing borrowed from Roderick Steen, and gives Jonathan the cold shoulder. She looks over Palmer’s map, and suggests a way in to the Grimmer Company lab.</Synopsis>
            <Text>One of the deckhands was kind enough to draw a bath for Annabel. A bath room on an airship seemed a ridiculous extravagance to Annabel, and the Dreadful’s bath room took this extravagance further still. It was a wide room with a deep clawfoot tub and—to Annabel’s amazement—it had in-built plumbing. She had only to turn on the taps and a fresh stream of hot water would spill out of the pipes and into the tub. There were little bottles of fragrances and jars of bath salts on the shelves, but Annabel could hardly see the point of using them. She just wanted to scrub the blood from her skin, and she knew that in a few hours she was likely to have a fresh coat of blood on her skin, not to mention a layer of sweat.
Annabel had made a career of robbing wealthy gentlemen, and had over her years acquired more than one item that on its own could have bought entire countries. From rare works of art to crown jewels and enormous diamonds, Annabel was no stranger to riches. She could have lived like a queen. But she had never really been able to shake the notion that she didn’t belong among the ton. Among the rich, she was an imposter. Among the poor, she was a traitor. She couldn’t help but feeling she had abandoned her brothers and sisters in suffering.
When so much of the city was struggling just to survive their lives of poverty, how could anyone enjoy their lives of luxury? She had tried to instill in herself the notion that it was every man for himself, she tried to harden her heart, to remind herself that she was supposed to be a hardened criminal, impervious to the lives of others. But try as she might, she hadn’t been able to forget her humble upbringing, her life on the street. How dirty she’d been as an orphan, and how cold, how alone, and how hungry. It sickened her to see others suffering while the wealthy grew ever richer.
While other girls had sold their bodies for a penny just to have a roof over their heads for a night, Annabel had been spared by her talent for picking pockets. She’d grown rich thanks to her benefactor, Anthony Tidkins. On more than one occasion, Annabel had given her takings from her various heists to charity.
And yet, here she was, soaking in a warm bath aboard the most lavish of airships Annabel had ever seen—in a bathroom as grand as any palace—while the rest of the city was struggling to survive as the zombie virus spread. And, she reminded herself, kissing the man who owned the airship. It was foolish of her to fall for Jonathan, charming as he was. They were not of the same class. She realized this as she soaked in the warm tub and washed herself clean with richly scented soap.
And as she caught a glimpse of her reflection in the looking glass, she felt more foolish still. She’d removed both her eye and her arm for getting in the tub. She stared into her cycloptic and scarred reflection and sighed.
There were silver clasps surgically installed into her eye socket, a mess of scarred and mangled flesh. A long, deep scar ran down one half of her face. Not only was she nouveau riche, a societal parvenu amongst the legitimate upper class, she bore the scars of the dangerous life she lived.
Her right arm was a stump, a few mere inches that ended abruptly at her upper arm where it had been amputated. That was how she’d survived the zombie bite all those years ago, in the barn behind Papa Doc’s home. Anthony Tidkins had taken her arm off with a bone saw before the virus could spread through her body.
She still had the feeling of an arm that wasn’t there. Occasionally swore she could feel an itch or a cramp in that arm although that was impossible.
Jonathan’s words ran through her mind. I think you’re extraordinary. She laughed. How foolish of her—she’d actually believed him.
She washed her hair and rinsed it under the copper pipes. She climbed out of the steaming tub, even less relaxed than when she’d climbed in. She snatched up a towel with her left hand and began to dry her hair. She felt a jolt as the airship shifted direction. She threw the towel over her shoulder, picked up her discarded prosthetic arm. The prosthetic connected to the surgical implants in the socket of her arm with a mechanical click. At once, she could move the arm again, and flex her fingers. She had no feeling in that arm, but she’d grown so accustomed to using the mechanical arm that it felt like second nature to use it. There were a couple of leather straps to help hold the heavy mechanical arm in place. She strapped them over her shoulder. There were deep lines in her skin from the leather straps.
Before replacing her eye, she wound up the gears with the key she wore around her neck. The clockwork began to tick, as she hooked up and strapped on her eye. She wound up her arm in the same manner, and with the same key. She finished toweling dry, and scooped up the clothes she’d borrowed from Roderick Steen’s wardrobe. Most of his ladies’ clothes were long, elaborate dresses in old fashioned styles from the Renaissance period, but she did manage to find one outfit that suited her well enough.
Rather than wear a skirt, she’d borrowed a pair of white trousers from Roderick’s personal wardrobe. She hoped he wouldn’t mind. They were a bit baggy on her, but better than being burdened by a bulky bustle skirt. This mission might require her to run or to fight, and she couldn’t do either easily while wearing a skirt. She dressed herself in a black corset, with a striped black and white blouse and a rich brown bodice, accessorized with a light brown corduroy jacket with a mandarin collar. Her key hung from her neck, pendant-like. She put on a bulky pair of leather boots and laced them up tight. Somehow she still managed to look stylish despite the androgynous ensemble.
She patted her damp hair again with the towel, and ran a comb through it. Jonathan had offered to send a maid to assist her, but Annabel had simply scowled at him until he retracted the offer. Now, as she sorted through her tangled hair and tried to style it so that it wouldn’t get in her way, she half-regretted that decision.
At last, she emerged from the bathroom, where one of the deckhands was waiting to escort her back to the passenger’s lounge. When she arrived, the gentlemen were gathered around Palmer’s sketch of the facility’s layout.
Jonathan smiled, and headed over to greet her with a kiss. Annabel strode past him, leaving him to kiss the air where she’d been a moment earlier and heading over to get a look at Palmer’s map.
“Just because I let you kiss me once doesn’t mean we’re on such familiar terms that you may do so whenever you please, Mr. Grimmer,” she said curtly, and took Jonathan’s vacated seat at the table. She reached for the map. “May I?”
“By all means,” said Palmer.
Jonathan stood, stammering a half-formed apology, while Annabel looked over the map and did her best to ignore him.
“There,” she said, pointing at the map. “That’s how we’ll get in.”
The others listened intently as she laid out the plan.
Only three of the Grimmer Company offices provided access to the Resurrectionist hideout. Palmer’s own office had the secret elevator, as did Charles Grimmer’s former office, and Mrs. Grimmer’s. There was a fourth and final access point from within the printing company. This was not an elevator but a hidden staircase, which led from the library to a hallway near the Beta Laboratory, which was shared by a number of the Resurrectionist’s scientists, and which was connected to the Alpha Laboratory by a long hallway.
In between the two laboratories were a number of offices, libraries, smaller medical labs, and living quarters for the scientists. The holding cells where Annabel and Parson Sinews had been held were in an adjacent hallway. They would have to stop by the holding cells in order to rescue Sinews, as well, assuming he hadn’t already been moved to Chateau d’If.
Aside from the elevators and the hidden staircase within the Grimmer Company, there was also a ladder that was accessible via a tailor’s shop across the street. The shop was a front, its only purpose to allow the Resurrectionists to access the facility without arousing the suspicions of the Grimmer Company’s employees.
Annabel had chosen a different point of access for herself and Abraham Palmer. Jonathan was to use the entrance in the tailor’s shop, while Roderick Steen would use the front door. After all, Mrs. Grimmer might not be in the underground facility. She might just be on the ground floor of the Grimmer Company, in which case there would be no need for Roderick to sneak into the underground facility. If necessary, he would sneak into the company library and access the facility via the hidden staircase.
“Is everyone clear on their roles?” Annabel asked. “Our mission depends on stealth. The scientists are not fighters. If we can avoid the guards, the plan should go off without a hitch. One wrong move, however, and the plan will fail. This could be our one shot at saving this city.”
Jonathan nodded. Annabel looked to Palmer, who gave her his assurances.
“Roderick?”
He nodded. “Let’s go save London.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene Three</Title>
            <Text>I was armed to the teeth and dressed in the most unusual outfit I could ever have imagined myself wearing. With Jack’s leather crow’s mask on my face, and his Icarus wings on my back, I must have looked like a human crow.
Most of my weapons were hidden beneath my skirts and shawl, except one: an old-fashioned small-sword, loaned to me by Dr. Karnstein.
I wore a pair of tall leather boots, but I was still careful to watch where I stepped as I traipsed through the bushes into the backyard of the colonial mansion of Papa Doc. Apparently there were deadly snakes and poisonous spiders in this small island nation, and I was naively more terrified of both snakes and spiders than I was of Papa Doc’s army of zombies.
I’d told Jack that I was not an assassin, but when Dr. Karnstein had explained the entirety of the situation, I felt that an exception might be in order. The female scientist wanted Papa Doc gone because he had been speaking out against her research, turning the locals against her. She feared for her research, but she also feared for her life. If Papa Doc gave the word, she would be dead within the day.
But the situation was more complicated still than that.
These zombies of Papa Doc’s were not under his control, as he claimed they were. And they were not the usual sort of zombies, if such a thing exists. They were not created by the methods traditionally used by bokors. They were created by injection.
Dr. Karnstein had been studying an unusual disease, once that kills its victims quickly but causes them to rise after death. Lazarus, I am sure of it now. It must have been the same disease. Its victims would revive after death, and given to cannibalistic urges, would viciously attack their loved ones. Even after they’d begun to rot, they would continue walking, hungry for living flesh.
A sample of the disease had been stolen from Dr. Irving’s laboratory. The evidence pointed to Papa Doc.
With a gas lamp to light my way, I pushed through the thick vegetation and made my way into his garden. I only half believed what Dr. Karnstein had told me. I didn’t believe these men were truly dead, just sick. And I had no idea just how dangerous they were, despite what Jack and Dr. Karnstein had told me.
The yard itself was deserted and dark, but there were lights on inside the house, so I had to be careful not to pass in front of the windows. Cautiously picking my path, I navigated the floral garden and stepped beneath the veranda.
I dimmed the lamp and slowly I made my way toward the back door. Suddenly I heard a noise that startled me. Most of the noises here were foreign to me. The call of the birds were strange, and the chirps of the insects were alien, but the noise that startled me was strangely familiar. But it was not human.
I directed my lamp at the source of the noise and spied a small building across the yard that I assumed was either a barn or a guest house. Checking to be sure that no one was coming, I abandoned the mansion and began to cross the yard toward the building.
As I drew closer, I began to make out the features of the building, and came to the conclusion that it was a barn. The noises that came from within also became more clear. Voices, I realised. They sounded like voices.
I approached the wide doors of the barn, raising my sword as I walked slowly through the tall grass. The voices became louder as I drew near, but they weren’t distinct enough to determine how many of them there were. Their voices all seemed to blend together until they just became a choir of muffled moans and coughs. Choking voices, hacking coughs, and sometimes wretched growls. The voices were strained and sickly, rough and phlegmy. They hardly seemed human.
I set the oil lamp down on the ground so my hands would be free, then readying my sword, opened the door. The voices stopped in an instant as a hundred faces turned to look at me. The sudden silence was deafening.
Suddenly thinking better of my initial decision to put the lamp down, I hastily grasped for it and with one hand turned the dial, causing the lamp to brighten. Then I stepped inside and closed the door behind me.
The zombies stirred out of their temporary shock at seeing their prey walk straight into their den. All at once, they moved toward me. I was ready with my sword. I began to slash through them, cutting each one down as they approached with slow and rotten limbs.
Each face I sliced into was a man or a woman from the village, farmers mostly, fathers and wives, sons and daughters.   All of them were dressed plainly, some wearing caps upon their heads, some bare-chested with thick muscles becoming atrophied post mortem. Their faces were emaciated, their eyes sunken into their heads.
They were slow, but they were many, and they were hungry. Soon, I had worked up a good sweat inside my crow’s head mask and bustle skirt. But I did not slow in my frenzied killing spree.
Left, right, behind me, I met them all with my sword. I was everywhere at once, cutting them down, creating a whirlwind of blood and body parts which rained down upon the floor of the barn.
Bodies piled up around me so that I barely had room to move any more. My arm began to ache, so I took advantage of my ambidexterity and switched hands, lifting the lamp above my head so I could not only hear them coming with their raspy breaths and ravenous growls but also see them approaching. See their hands twitch with excitement when they were ready to move in and attack.
I resisted the impulse to add my voice to the fray, instead swinging my sword in silence. Finally, after what seemed like hour on end of slaughter, but what must in reality have been a matter of seconds, I had decimated the bulk of them.
A euphoric calm settled over me in the aftermath of violence. The settling of adrenaline, the calming of my rattled nerves.
Only one of Papa Doc’s zombies remained. Which was exactly how it was supposed to have gone. It was Jack’s idea that it should be one of Papa Doc’s own wretched creatures that executed him. Poetic justice. In my own naivety, I readily agreed, even laughed at the idea, horrifying though it seems to me now.
This one wretched creature, on its own in the darkest corner of the barn, quietly moved toward me. Somehow, though I’d just faced a hundred of these monstrous things, facing one alone felt different.
Looking into the eyes of a creature that once was human, and knowing that you must cut him down…
Even though I’d been told that this poor wretch was already dead, I didn’t know what to believe.
My heart began to hammer against my chest. The sweat within my mask turned cold. The creature met my eyes.
I’ll never forget those eyes. Pale, colourless orbs, set within a face that was little more than skin and bones.
The creature dragged its hands across the gore-slick floor and crawled its way to me. With no legs to walk upon, this wretched creature was persistent in its hunger. It dragged itself slowly, breathing through its nostrils, those pale eyes unblinking.
I set the lamp down on the ground and sheathed my sword. I reached out to take hold of him, careful not to let him bite me.
That was when I was seized from behind.
I whirled around to see one of those hideous wretches I thought I’d slain, grasping my ankle. The creature was pulling itself out from under the pile of corpses, and its grip was strong and unrelenting. I reached to draw my sword again; if it would not relinquish its grip, I would sever its arm from its body.
But I was grabbed again from behind, this time by the arm.
I yelped and pulled away, somehow managing to pull out of the creature’s grip, but I stumbled over the pile over corpses and fell. I landed in a mess of limbs softened by decay.
The stench in the barn was horrible, even through my mask, but it was worse amongst that pile of severed limbs and still-groping fingers.
I could hear them breathing. I felt the pile of corpses move.
In the throes of panic, I pushed myself back, away from the pile of corpses, even as they grabbed at me. I caught glimpses of their pale eyes, still looking at me. They grasped at me with renewed fervour. I pushed and kicked and shoved my way backward, away from the corpses, until I was free of them.
How many of these creatures had somehow survived their slaughter? I’d hacked off their limbs, slit their throats, or disemboweled every last one of them.
But it was the ones whose faces I’d failed to cut through, whose eyes I’d not poked out. Those were the ones whose bodies were still moving. Dr. Karnstein had warned me. She’d told me to destroy their brains. But I hadn’t grasped the importance of that point. I did now.
Suddenly, I heard the sound of something breathing in my ear. The breath was cold on the back of my neck, so close I could feel it. I whirled around and screamed.
It was the creature with no legs. Suddenly, it reached out with its gnarled and yellowing fingernails and grabbed at my mask, tearing at the leather stitching. It dug in with its fingers in such a frenzy that against all odds, it managed to tear open a weak spot in the mask, even with its rotting muscles and flesh. 
And when it had torn a hole in the eye of the mask, it reached in and grasped my naked flesh as hard as it could with its atrophied muscles.
It gouged me with its sharp nails until it broke the skin and hot blood squirted from my face like the juice of a burst grape.
I screamed to see my own blood rain down upon the zombie’s face. I felt warm blood run down my cheek. I felt sick.
At some point, I wasn’t sure when, I’d lost the vision in my right eye.
I felt a dull pain in my right arm, but I hardly noticed it. Something was biting me. Tearing through the fabric of my sleeve, chewing through my flesh. Biting down to the marrow.
I fought back, kicking and screaming.
Even as I struggled, I could still see that horrid creature raise its bloodied hands to its mouth and chew happily upon my severed eye.
I tore myself away from the hands that grasped me, tore my arm from the hungry jaws of a dead man. I felt faint. Dizzy. Nauseous.
I grasped for my blade. I struggled to my feet, caught my balance, and raised a hand to run the zombie through with my blade. I found I could barely lift the sword with that arm. Blood had soaked through my sleeve. There was no feeling in my arm. No pain. Just numbness.
I transferred the sword to my other arm and stabbed it through the zombie’s hideous face as it licked its lips.
I’d ceased being afraid now. Now I was furious.
I reached down and tore my eye from its jaws and held onto it as tightly as I could with my hand that had lost all feeling.
Turning back to the pile of corpses, I roughly grabbed each one that looked at me, beginning with the thing that had ravaged my arm.
I pulled it from the pile and shoved my sword through its head. I continued in that manner until the bodies stopped twitching. All of them but one, anyway.
Dragging the severed upper body and head of the last remaining zombie with my one good arm, I pushed open the door of the barn. Stumbling dizzily, I hiked across the lawn toward the mansion.
Papa Doc and his servants must have become accustomed to strange noises coming from the barn, because no one had come outside to investigate. Or maybe they were all still asleep.
I revved the engine of the Icarus wings, pulled a cord to spread my wings, and lifted off the ground, heading towards the upstairs window where Papa Doc was most likely sleeping. I can’t remember what happened next. I blacked out.</Text>

François Duvalier (14 April 1907 – 21 April 1971), also known as 'Papa Doc' Duvalier, was the President of Haiti from 1957 until his death in 1971. He opposed a military coup d'état in 1950, and was elected president in 1957 on a populist and black nationalist platform. His rule, based on a purged military, a rural militia known as the Tonton Macoute and the use of a personality cult and voodoo, resulted in the murder of an estimated 30,000 Haitians and the exile of many more. Ruling as President for Life from 1964 until his death in 1971, Duvalier was initially known for successfully fighting diseases, gaining him the nickname 'Papa Doc' ("Daddy Doc[tor]" in French). He was succeeded by his son, Jean-Claude, nicknamed "Baby Doc".[3]

Duvalier was born in Port-au-Prince, the son of Duval Duvalier, a justice of the peace, and Ulyssia Abraham, a baker. He was largely raised by an aunt. He completed a degree in medicine from the University of Haiti in 1934. He served as staff physician at several local hospitals.[4] He spent a year at the University of Michigan studying public health.[5] In 1943, he became active in a U.S.-sponsored campaign to control the spread of contagious tropical diseases, helping the poor to fight typhus, yaws, malaria and other tropical diseases that ravaged Haiti for years.[4][5] His patients affectionately called him "Papa Doc", a moniker that he used throughout his life.[6]
Lucky enough to be schooled and literate in a country where few were educated, Duvalier witnessed the political turmoil of his country. The invasion and occupation of U.S. Marines on Haitian soil in 1915, followed by incessant violent repressions of political dissent, left a powerful impression on the young Duvalier. He was also aware of the latent political power of the poor black majority and their resentment against the tiny mulatto elite.[7] Duvalier became involved in the négritude movement of Haitian author Dr. Jean Price-Mars. He began an ethnological study of Vodou that later paid enormous political dividends.[7][8] In 1938, Duvalier co-founded the journal Les Griots. In 1939, Duvalier married Simone Ovide, with whom he had four children: Marie Denise, Nicole, Simone and Jean-Claude.[5]

In 1946, Duvalier aligned himself with President Dumarsais Estimé and was appointed Director General of the National Public Health Service. In 1949, Duvalier served as Minister of both Health and Labour; but, when General Paul Magloire ousted President Estimé in a coup d'état, Duvalier left the government and was forced into hiding until 1956, when an amnesty was declared.[9]
In December 1956, Magloire resigned and left Haiti to the rule by a succession of provisional governments. On 22 September 1957, presidential elections pitted Louis Déjoie, a mulatto land-owner and industrialist from the north of Haiti, against Duvalier, who was backed by the military. Duvalier campaigned as a populist, using a noiriste strategy of challenging the mulatto elite and appealing to the Afro-Haitian majority. He described his opponent as part of the ruling mulatto class that was making life difficult for the country's rural black majority. The election resulted in Duvalier defeating Déjoie with 678,860 votes. Déjoie polled 264,830 votes and independent candidate Jumelle a mere percentage of the electorate. Duvalier's only opponent among the black proletarians, Daniel Fignolé, had been forced into exile before election, conveniently leaving Duvalier a path for a landslide.[10]

After being sworn in on 22 October, Duvalier exiled most of the major supporters of Déjoie[5] and had a new constitution adopted in 1957.[6]
President Duvalier promoted and patronised members of the black majority in the civil service and the army.[11] In mid-1958, the army, which had supported Duvalier earlier, tried to oust him in another coup, but failed. In response, Duvalier replaced the chief-of-staff with a more reliable officer and then proceeded to create his own power base within the army by turning the army's Presidential Guard into an elite corps aimed at maintaining Duvalier's power. After this, Duvalier dismissed the entire general staff and replaced it with officers owing their positions and their loyalty to him.[6] In 1958 three exiled Haitians and five Americans invaded Haiti and tried to overthrow Duvalier; all the invaders were killed.[12]
In 1959, Duvalier created a rural militia, the Milice Volontaires de la Sécurité Nationale (MVSN, English: National Security Volunteer Militia), commonly referred to as the Tonton Macoute after a Creole term for the bogeyman, to extend and bolster support for the regime in the countryside. The Macoute, which by 1961 had twice the numbers of the regular army, never developed into a real military force but still was more than a mere secret police.[6][13]
In the name of nationalism, Duvalier expelled almost all of Haiti's foreign-born bishops, an act that earned him excommunication from the Catholic Church.[7] In 1966, Duvalier managed to persuade the Holy See to allow him one-time permission to nominate the Catholic hierarchy for Haiti. This action solidified the change to the status-quo: no longer was Haiti under the grip of the minority rich mulattoes, protected by the military, and supported by the church. From this day forward Francois Duvalier exercised all power in Haiti.[14]
On 24 May 1959, Duvalier suffered a massive heart attack, possibly due to an insulin overdose; he had been a diabetic since early adulthood and also suffered from heart disease and associated circulatory problems. During this heart attack he was unconscious for nine hours; many associates believed that he suffered neurological damage during these events that affected his mental health and made him paranoid.[15]
While recovering, Duvalier left power in the hands of Clément Barbot, leader of the Tonton Macoutes. Upon his return, Duvalier accused Barbot of trying to supplant him as president and had him imprisoned. In April 1963, Barbot was released and began plotting to remove Duvalier from office by kidnapping his children. The plot failed and Duvalier subsequently ordered a massive search for Barbot and his fellow conspirators. When during the search Duvalier was told that Barbot had transformed himself into a black dog, Duvalier ordered that all black dogs in Haiti be put to death. Barbot was later captured and shot by the Tonton Macoutes in July 1963. In other incidents, Duvalier ordered the head of an executed rebel packed in ice and brought to him so he could commune with the dead man's spirit.[16] Peep holes were carved into the walls of the interrogation chambers, through which Duvalier personally observed Haitian detainees being tortured and submerged in baths of sulfuric acid; sometimes, he was directly in the room during the tortures.[17]
In 1961, he began violating the provisions of the 1957 constitution: first he replaced the bicameral legislature with a unicameral body. Then he called a new presidential election in which he was the sole candidate, though his term was to expire in 1963 and the constitution prohibited re-election. The election was flagrantly rigged; the official tally showed 1,320,748 voted yes to another term for Duvalier, with none opposed.[6] Upon hearing the results, Duvalier proclaimed: "I accept the people's will. As a revolutionary, I have no right to disregard the will of the people."[9][18] The New York Times commented: "Latin America has witnessed many fraudulent elections throughout its history but none has been more outrageous than the one which has just taken place in Haiti."[18] On 14 June 1964, a constitutional referendum made Duvalier "President for Life", a title previously held by seven Haitian presidents. This referendum was also blatantly rigged; an implausible 99.9 percent voted in favour, and all ballots were premarked "yes."[6][19] The new document granted Duvalier—or "Le Souverain," as he was called—absolute powers as well as the right to name his successor.
His relationship with the United States proved difficult. In his early years, Duvalier often rebuked the United States for its friendly relations with the Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo (killed in 1961), while leaving Haiti, "the poor negro Republic out in the cold". The Kennedy administration (1961–63) was particularly disturbed by Duvalier's repressive and authoritarian rule and allegations that he misappropriated aid money, then a substantial part of the Haitian budget, and a Marine mission to train the Tonton Macoute. Acting on the charges, Washington cut off most of its economic assistance in mid-1962, pending stricter accounting procedures, which Duvalier refused. Duvalier publicly renounced all aid from Washington on nationalist grounds, portraying himself as a "...principled and lonely opponent of domination by a great power."[6]
Duvalier misappropriated millions of US dollars of international aid, including 15 million US dollars annually from the United States.[20] He transferred this money to personal accounts. Another of Duvalier's methods to obtain foreign money was to gain foreign loans, including 4 million USD from Cuban president Fulgencio Batista.[21]
After the assassination of John F. Kennedy in November 1963—which Duvalier later claimed resulted from a curse that he had placed on him[22]—the U.S. eased its pressure on Duvalier, grudgingly accepting him as a bulwark against Communism.[6][23] Duvalier attempted to exploit tensions between the United States and Cuba, emphasizing his anti-Communist credentials and Haiti's strategic location as a means of winning U.S. support:
“	Communism has established centres of infection... No area in the world is as vital to American security as the Caribbean... We need a massive injection of money to reset the country on its feet, and this injection can come only from our great, capable friend and neighbor the United States."[24]	”
After President Fulgencio Batista (a personal friend of Duvalier[25]) was overthrown in the Cuban Revolution, Duvalier, worried that Fidel Castro would provide a safe haven for Haitian dissidents, attempted to win Castro over by recognizing his government, sending medicine, and pardoning several political prisoners, but to no avail; from the very start of his regime, Castro gave anti-Duvalier dissidents his full support.[26]
Duvalier enraged Castro by voting against the country in an OAS meeting and subsequently at the UN where a trade embargo was imposed on Cuba. Cuba answered by breaking off diplomatic relations and Duvalier subsequently instituted a campaign to rid Haiti of communists.[27]
Duvalier's relationship with the neighbouring Dominican Republic was always tense: in his early years, Duvalier emphasised the differences between the two countries. In April 1963, relations were brought to the edge of war by the political enmity between Duvalier and the Dominican president Juan Bosch. Bosch, a left-leaning democrat, provided asylum and support to Haitian exiles who plotted against the Duvalier regime. Duvalier ordered his Presidential Guard to occupy the Dominican Embassy in Pétionville, aiming at apprehending an army officer believed to have been involved in Barbot's plot to kidnap Duvalier's children. The Dominican president reacted with outrage, publicly threatened to invade Haiti, and ordered army units to the frontier. However, as Dominican military commanders expressed little support for an invasion of Haiti, Bosch refrained from the invasion and settled for a mediation by the OAS.[6][28]
Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia briefly visited Haiti in 1966 (he was the only head of state to visit the country during Duvalier's presidency[29]); during his visit, Duvalier awarded him the Necklace of the Order of Jean-Jacques Dessalines the Great, and Selassie, in turn, bestowed upon Duvalier the Great Necklace of the Order of the Queen of Saba.[29]
Duvalier also supported Pan-African ideals.[11]

Duvalier's government was soon accused of being one of the most repressive in the hemisphere.[30] Within the country, Duvalier used both political murder and expulsion to suppress his opponents; estimates of those killed are as high as 30,000.[6] Attacks on Duvalier from within the military were treated as especially serious. When bombs were detonated near the Presidential Palace in 1967, Duvalier had nineteen Presidential Guard officers shot in Fort Dimanche.[31] A few days later Duvalier had a public speech during which he read the "attendance sheet" with names of all 19 officers killed. After each name he said "absent". After reading the whole list, Duvalier remarked, "All were shot."[32]
Haitian communists and suspected communists, in particular, bore the brunt of the government's repression.[33] Duvalier targeted them both as a means to secure U.S. support as a bulwark against Communist Cuba (see below) and on principle: Duvalier had personally been exposed to communist and left-wing ideas early in his life and rejected them.[33] On 28 April 1969, Duvalier instituted a campaign to rid Haiti of all communists, promulgating a law stipulating that "Communist activities, no matter what their form, are hereby declared crimes against the security of the State," and prescribing the death penalty for individuals prosecuted under this law.[34]
Duvalier employed intimidation, repression and patronage to supplant the old mulatto elites with a new elite of his own making. Corruption — in the form of government rake-offs of industries, bribery, extortion of domestic businesses, and stolen government funds — enriched the dictator's closest supporters. Most of these supporters held sufficient power to enable them to intimidate the members of the old elite who were gradually co-opted or eliminated.[6]
Many educated professionals fled Haiti for New York City, Miami, French-speaking Montreal, Paris, and several French-speaking African countries, exacerbating an already serious lack of doctors and teachers. Some of the highly skilled professionals joined the ranks of several UN agencies to work in development in newly independent nations such as Côte d'Ivoire, and Congo.
The government confiscated peasant land holdings and allotted them to members of the militia,[7] who had no official salary and made their living through crime and extortion.[13] The dispossessed swelled the slums by fleeing to the capital to seek meager incomes to feed themselves. Malnutrition and famine became endemic.[7]
Nonetheless, Duvalier enjoyed significant support among Haiti's majority black rural population, who saw in him a champion of their claims against the historically dominant mulatto élite. During his fourteen years in power, he created a substantial black middle class, chiefly through government patronage.[13] Duvalier also initiated the development of Mais Gate Airport, now known as Toussaint Louverture International Airport.
Duvalier fostered a personality cult around himself, and claimed he was the physical embodiment of the island nation. He also started to revive the traditions of vodou, later on using them to consolidate his power as he claimed to be a houngan, or vodou priest himself. In an effort to make himself even more imposing, Duvalier deliberately modeled his image on that of Baron Samedi. He often donned sunglasses to hide his eyes and talked with the strong nasal tone associated with the loa. The Duvalier regime propaganda even stated that "Papa Doc: was one with the loas, Jesus Christ, and God himself". The most celebrated image from the time shows a standing Jesus Christ with hand on a seated Papa Doc's shoulder with the caption "I have chosen him".[27] There was even a Duvalierist variant of the Lord's Prayer.[35]
Duvalier also held in his closet the head of his former opponent Blucher Philogenes, who tried to overthrow him in 1963.[36]

Duvalier held Haiti in his grip until his death in early 1971. His 19-year-old son Jean-Claude Duvalier, nicknamed "Baby Doc", succeeded him as president.

Many books have been written about the Duvalier era in Haiti, the best known being Graham Greene's novel, The Comedians, which Duvalier himself dismissed as the work of "a mere journalist" and vilified at every opportunity. It was later made into a movie. Greene himself was declared persona non grata and barred from Haiti. The British television journalist Alan Whicker made a documentary Papa Doc: The Black Sheep (1969) and interviewed the president.
The first authoritative book on the subject was Papa Doc: Haiti and its Dictator by Al Burt and Bernard Diederich, published in 1969, though several others by Haitian scholars and historians have appeared since Duvalier's death in 1971. One of the most informative, Dungeon of Death, dealt specifically with victims of Fort Dimanche, the prison Duvalier used for the torture and murder of his political opponents.
In 2007, the British newspaper editor John Marquis published Papa Doc: Portrait of a Haitian Tyrant (LMH Publishing), which used an espionage trial in Haiti in 1968 as the foundation of an account of the regime. This book was widely praised as having exposed several previously unexplored details about the numerous attempts on Duvalier's life and was given credence by Marquis's own meeting with Duvalier in the National Palace in Port-au-Prince during the trial. The defendant, David Knox, the Bahamas director of information, was sentenced to death and later reprieved, even though he was accused by the regime of helping to organise an air raid on Duvalier's palace earlier that year.

            <Text>“Perhaps you’re right. I shall defer to the other clues,” Roderick replied.
“Which are, what precisely?”
Roderick let out an exaggerated sigh.
“Is yours a practiced stupidity, or does it come naturally to you?” he asked. “Very well then. The clues. The handle of the door, as I’m sure you noticed, had a crimson stain on the handle, which on its own could be considered quite innocuous; it could be wine or paint, to be certain, but it does seem a bit ominous, doesn’t it? There is also the fact that the door has been kicked in—you can’t have failed to notice that—which means that whoever killed Connor was interrupted, hence the hasty exit via the window. The diorama was completed later; it must have been, because the reading of The Raven was set to be played when someone entered the room, was it not? It should therefore have been played the moment the door was broken down, not later, when your officers entered the scene. So, the man who fled via the window was not the man who created this elaborate display. The second man then? Perhaps. But are we to assume he fled via the window, like the first man, only to then return to the party where he caused a scene and unleashed the plague? Again, perhaps. But we must also consider the gunshot wound in Connor’s bloody face. Don’t tell me you missed that too. Surely not. So, we know that Connor was not murdered in Allen’s typical surgical fashion. He was murdered by gunshot, then the diorama was made; Dr. Allen, as you likely know, conducts his experiments while his subjects are still living. Again, this suggests that the scene was staged, for our benefit, likely after that plague was unleashed downstairs. Perhaps by the second man. Perhaps not. In either case, somebody went to a lot of trouble to ensure that we believed Dr. Allen was responsible.”
Taggert was twirling his moustache, a habit that Roderick was having difficulty ignoring. He turned away in order to regain his concentration.
“There is also the fact that the desk has been moved,” he said. “Note the indentation on the carpet, left by the legs of the desk. If I can trust that your officers have enough sense to have left the crime scene untouched, we can deduce that the desk was moved, likely during a struggle, either between Connor and one of the gentlemen, or between the gentlemen themselves. Later, the desk was moved back, but it sat there long enough to indent the carpet. Here, the carpet is damp. You might not have noticed it, which I suppose can be forgiven, as you’re all quite strangely wearing shoes. But I assure you, it is quite damp; somebody did a rather remarkable job of washing the blood out of the carpet, but it has not yet completely dried, and it still smells faintly of copper, does it not? Of course, perhaps the most revealing clue is that Connor’s safe has been robbed.”
For a moment, nobody spoke. The policemen looked about the room, dumb expressions on their faces, as their eyes followed Mr. Steen’s explanation of the clues they’d just spent several hours not noticing. One of the officers stooped over and touched the carpet. He put his nose close to it and sniffed. He nodded, confirming that the carpet was damp and had the blood-like smell of copper.
“His safe?” asked the officer with the distinguishing moustache.
“Yes,” said Mr. Steen, “You failed to notice that as well.”
It wasn’t a question. The policemen looked about the room, all of them refusing to meet Mr. Steen’s eyes. Silence reigned. Finally, Roderick pointed it out.
“That’s a tea trolley,” Mr. Taggert protested.
“Oh, really? In that case, assam.”
Taggert snorted. He marched across the room to the trolley. Which is when he realised that it wasn’t a tea trolley at all. Beneath the cart, a locked box had been worked into the design of the furniture. The door was cracked open.
“Eat your words, Mr. Taggert.”
“Gloating does not become you, Mr. Steen,” Taggert replied.
He stooped over and pulled the door open. Within the box, a large, steel safe was concealed. Its door too, was cracked open. He swung the door the rest of the way open and peered inside. Empty.
“I don’t suppose you know what was in the safe?” asked Mr. Taggert.
“How would I possibly know that?” asked Mr. Steen, incredulous. “I’m not a psychic.”
“Please,” said Taggert. “Focus, Mr. Steen. I believe we’re just beginning to form a picture of what happened here. Just tell us what you think happened here.”
“Very well,” said Roderick. And this was precisely what he intended to do, before the young officer burst into the room, breathless and sweaty.
“The dead,” he stammered, “The dead…”
“Spit it out, boy,” Taggert commanded.
The officer looked up at his Inspector, his face pale.
“The dead are waking up.”
With that, he collapsed, spilling blood on the floor.
Roderick stepped back, not wanting to get blood on his feet. The back of the young man’s neck had been ripped open and there were what looked like tooth marks in his flesh.</Text>
            <Comments>Says the man who dropped his gloves on the floor and then a candy wrapper! Ha!
I can just image the smirk that is curling up on his face as he says these words.  Maybe make a note of that so your readers can see that too, unless you prefer to keep him emotionless.  Paint the picture how you see it!
If the young officer was bitten on the back of his neck so roughly to the point that tissue was removed (assuming that he is not the only one) Did they not hear screaming as the dead woke and attacked people?</Comments>

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>Years Ago

Parson moved back across the tiny cell and sat down upon the bed as he listened to Faria. He still had the alarming feeling that the floor was moving. It felt unsteady beneath his feet. Though he couldn’t quite shake the feeling, even when he sat down on the bed, he attempted to relax on the uncomfortable wooden frame.
The priest lingered at the the wall that separated their cells. He stood there for a while without speaking, as if taking the time to formulate his thoughts, or perhaps he was just sleeping standing up. Mr. Sinews recalled the somnambulist card in the tarot of the Moirae.
But at last he spoke. “You said earlier that you didn’t know anything at all that could make you dangerous. Not a thing at all that might make you a political prisoner. And yet…” he began.
He paused in his speech at the sound of the voices of the prison guards making their rounds.
The small metal door slid open and the guard slid a tray of something vaguely resembling food into his cell.
“What is this?” said Mr. Sinews, staring at the gruel.
“You were expecting tea and crumpets?” asked Faria.
The guard laughed gruffly and marched onward.
Mr. Sinews groaned as he got out of bed and retrieved the meal. Cold porridge with a few dark brown chunks of what he hoped were apples.
“You were saying?” he said, spooning some of the gruel into his mouth and attempting not to grimace at the taste and texture.
“Ah,” said the priest, “Well, it seems quite obvious to me why you’re here. And I think that if you would just open your eyes, you’d see it too.”
Mr. Sinews groaned, not just at the quality of the meal or the sensation that the room was moving, but also at the fact that the priest was still speaking in riddles.
“You say you don’t know anything dangerous,” said the priest, “And yet, you said yourself that you were looking into several theories regarding Dr. Allen’s work, some of which could be considered treasonous.”
“You don’t think…”
“What do you think?” said the priest, “You hypothesized that Dr. Allen’s most heinous experiments that were publicly criticized by Her Majesty’s Armed Forces, were not the result of the Doctor going rogue but were in fact planned all along by the British military.”
The doctor grunted enthusiastically at the quality of his porridge, while Mr. Sinews struggled to keep his down.
“So,” said the priest, “Suppose your theory was correct…”
Mr. Sinews set down his meal.
“I suppose…” he said, following the priest’s logic, but it was difficult to think with the room spinning around him and his stomach protesting against the gruel and with his grief still fresh in his mind.
“Suppose your theory was correct,” continued Faria, “Do you really think they’d call you innocent and give you leave to continue investigating?”
“So,” said Mr. Sinews, “Whoever had me thrown in here…”
“Must have known that your hypothesis was correct,” said the priest, “And must therefore have been involved in the Doctor’s experiments, at least in some capacity. You are here, Mr. Sinews, not because you’re guilty, but to prevent you from exposing the truth.”
“The judge,” said Mr. Sinews, “It must have been the judge.”
“What makes you so sure?” asked Faria.
“His name,” said Mr. Sinews, cursing, “Hell, I should have known I’d heard that name somewhere before. God damn my foolishness.”
“What was his name,” asked Faria.
“The Honourable James Vane,” said Mr. Sinews, cursing violently, “God damn it all. The judge was Dr. Allen.”</Text>

She had a scarf wrapped around her face to deal with the smell, although the tunnel they were using was a maintenance tunnel. No actual sewage flowed along this route, but it was close enough to the pipes that did contain sewage, so the smell was still something to contend with.
“When Joseph Bazalgette designed his sewage system, Mr. Grimmer—Charles Grimmer, that is—made arrangements to have this tunnel constructed in secret, connecting the sewer system to the underground facility.”
“Mr. Grimmer was a very suspicious man,” Annabel mused.
Palmer grunted in agreement.
“Yes, well, you’re not paranoid if they really are trying to kill you, right?”
Annabel couldn’t agree more. That’s why she’d insisted that Palmer go with her. She wanted to keep an eye on him. Though Jonathan had vouched for him, Annabel still didn’t trust him.
They had entered via the Abbey Mills Pumping Station, gaining access to the building via an open window on the second story. With a rope, lowered from the deck of the Penny Dreadful, they’d swung across, onto the roof of the lower annex. From there, it had been simple enough to climb in through the window.
Palmer carried a gas lantern as they walked the length of the tunnel, which cast shadows along the walls of the corridor. He favoured his left hand, given the injury to his right shoulder.
Kass had managed to extract the bullet and stitch his wound; though the mechanic’s education was specific to the study of Aeronautical Engineering, she was still the most scientifically knowledgeable among them, and had a steady enough hand. According to Kass, human beings are just like extra complicated machines.
Their footsteps echoed down the tunnel.
“So, the Resurrectionists don’t know about this entrance?” Annabel asked.
The narrow tunnel came to a sudden dead end. They halted, Annabel looking up at Palmer with concern.
“Did we take a wrong turn somewhere?” she asked.
He shook his head, grinning knowingly.
“Nope,” he said, reaching up with gloved hand and exploring the brickwork with his fingers until he found a hidden latch.
“Ah,” said Annabel. “I believe I understand. It would hardly do to have some unsuspecting sewage worker wander down this tunnel and inadvertently discover the secret facility.”
“Exactly, m’dear,” said Palmer, gruffly.
As the latch pulled, the bricks began to swing open, like a door. As they did, it became clear that they were not bricks at all. Just thick cardboard, painted to look like bricks, like props in a stage production. The faux brickwork was glued to a thick, metal door, which opened into a closet. As they stepped inside it, Annabel noted that there was trickery on both sides to conceal the door. False brickwork slid along a track to hide the door from view, shutting them in to the underground facility.</Text>
            <Notes>As Mr. Palmer’s map made clear, only three of the Grimmer Company offices provided access to the Resurrectionist hideout. Palmer’s own office had the secret elevator, as did Charles Grimmer’s former office, and Mrs. Grimmers. There was a fourth and final access point from within the printing company. This was not an elevator but a hidden staircase, which led from the library to the Beta Laboratory, which was shared by a number of the Resurrectionist’s scientists, and which was connected to the Alpha Laboratory by a long hallway. In between the two laboratories were a number of offices, libraries, smaller medical labs, and living quarters for the scientists. The holding cells where Annabel and Parson Sinews had been held were in an adjacent hallway. They would have to stop by the holding cells in order to rescue Sinews, as well, assuming he hadn’t already been moved to Chateau d’If.
Aside from the elevators and the hidden staircase within the Grimmer Company, there was also a ladder that was accessible via a tailor’s shop across the street. The shop was a front, its only purpose to allow the Resurrectionists to access the facility without arousing the suspicions of the Grimmer Company’s employees.
Annabel had chosen a different point of access for herself and Abraham Palmer. Jonathan was to use the entrance in the tailor’s shop, while Roderick Steen would use the front door. That had been his own suggestion. After all, Mrs. Grimmer might not be in the underground facility. She might just be on the ground floor of the Grimmer Company, in which case there would be no need for Roderick to sneak into the underground facility. If necessary, he would sneak into the company library and access the facility via the hidden staircase.</Notes>

Tarot reading revolves around the belief that the cards can be used to gain insight into the past, current and possible future situations of the subject (or querent), i.e. cartomancy. Some[who?] believe they are guided by a spiritual force, while others[who?] believe the cards help them tap into a collective unconscious or their own creative, brainstorming subconscious[citation needed]. The divinatory meanings of the cards commonly used today are derived mostly from cartomancer Jean-Baptiste Alliette who was also known as Etteilla and Mlle Marie-Anne Adelaide Lenormand (1776-1843) (whose real name was Jean-Baptiste Alliette).[1][2] The belief in the divinatory meaning of the cards is closely associated with a belief in their occult, divine, and mystical properties: a belief constructed in the 18th century by prominent Protestant clerics and freemasons.[3]

Tarot decks can be identified by the presence or absence of twenty-one trump cards that work together with an additional collection of suit cards.[3] Traditionally the trumps and suits were part of a trump style game with many historical and national variations.[3] It was Ellic Howe, writing under the name Ély Star who came up with the terms 'major arcana' and 'minor arcana'[4] In modern times suit cards are Pentacles, Swords, Cups, and Wand. Trumps are cards like the Fool, The Magician, etc. Since the introduction of the cartomantic and occult tarot there have been ongoing attempts to "get it right."[3] Subsequently the names of both have been played with over time. A historical comparison of major arcana names and numbers can be found below.

Many individuals, particularly those involved in occult and divinatory practices, go to great pains to trace the lineage of the Western tarot to ancient Egyptian antiquity and divine hermetic wisdom.[5] The Tarot deck first appeared in a complete form (trumps, suits, etc.) in the courtly circles of Northern Italy in the 15th century[3] primarily for the purpose of gambling and card games.


Antoine Court de Gébelin
One of the earliest reference to Tarot triumphs, and probably the first reference to Tarot as the devil's picture book, is given by a Dominican preacher in a fiery sermon against the evils of the devil's instrument.[6] References to the tarot as a social plague continue throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, with no indication that the cards were used for anything but games anywhere other than in Blogna.[3] Tarot remained a simple card game for several centuries and only became widely associated with cartomancy after general cartomancy with normal playing cards became common in France. As Dummett (1980: 96) notes, "...it was only in the 1780s, when the practice of fortune-telling with regular playing cards had been well established for at least two decades, that anyone began to use the Tarot pack for cartomancy."[3]
Modern occult tarot begins in 1781, when Antoine Court de Gébelin, a Swiss clergyman and Freemason, published Le Monde Primitif, a speculative study which included religious symbolism and its survivals in the modern world. De Gébelin first asserted that symbolism of the Tarot de Marseille represented the mysteries of Isis and Thoth[citation needed]. Gébelin further claimed that the name tarot came from the Egyptian words tar, meaning royal, and ro, meaning road, and that the Tarot therefore represented a royal road to wisdom[citation needed]. De Gébelin also asserted that the Romani people (Gypsies), who were among the first to use cards for divination, were descendants of the ancient Egyptians and had introduced the cards to Europe[citation needed]. De Gébelin wrote this treatise before Jean-François Champollion had deciphered Egyptian hieroglyphs, or indeed before the Rosetta Stone had been discovered, and later Egyptologists found nothing in the Egyptian language to support de Gébelin's fanciful etymologies. Despite this, the identification of the Tarot cards with the Egyptian Book of Thoth was already firmly established in occult practice and continues in modern urban legend to the present day.
That the original Tarot deck was intended as nothing other than a game of cards, or a game of chance, did not prevent individuals from making it into something more than originally intended. From its humble uptake as an instrument of prophecy in France it went on to become a thing of hermeneutic, magical, mystical,[7] semiotic,[8] and even psychological importance. It became a tool for gypsies to tell fortunes, an unsurpassed means of communicating with supernatural entities,[9] a Jungian psychological apparatus capable of tapping into “absolute knowledge in the unconscious,” [10] an instrument capable of facilitating deep archetypal exegesis,[11] and even a tool of therapeutic praxis capable of facilitating the Jungian process of Individuation.[12] The career of the Italian tarot is remarkable in this regard, strains credulity, and raises key questions about the nature of the cards and their transformation into the bible of bibles[3] that it has come to be.

Four individuals stand out as the founding fathers of the widespread esoteric tarot (and tarot cartomancy). These individuals are Antoine Court de Gébelin, M[onsieur] le C[omte] de M.***,[13] Etteilla (whose real name was Jean-Baptiste Alliette), and Mlle Marie-Anne Adelaide Lenormand (1776-1843).[14] The modern occult tarot emerged at exactly the same time as the cartomantic tarot did and can be traced precisely to the publication of Le Monde Primitif, by Antoine Court de Gébelin, a Protestant pastor. Court de Gebelin's seminal book was published by private subscription several years after he became an active Freemason and member of the Lodge of the Neuf Soeurs.[3] It is a massive opus, incomplete at nine volumes.[3][15] According to Court this golden age was a reflection of "an eternal and immutable order, which unites heaven and earth, the body and the soul, the physical and the moral...."[3] The actual source of the occult tarot can be found in two articles in volume eight, published in 1781, of his magnum opus, one written by himself, and one written by M. le C. de M.***. In a section in that volume[citation needed] Court De Gébelin asserts that after seeing a group of women playing cards he was struck by the intuitive knowledge that the Tarot was not merely a game of cards but was in fact:
of ancient Egyptian origin
of mystical cabbalistic import
of deep divine significance
In his essay Court de Gebelin notes that "Tar" means way and "Ro" means royal, that each of the twenty two major arcana are linked with the twenty two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, and that the tarot is in fact a book of seventy-eight pages of mystical Egyptian revelation that only escaped the fires of Alexandria because Egyptian high priests had the foresight to hide its significance"[3]
The second essay in volume eight of Court de Gebelin's book, written by M le C de M.*** is noted to have been even more influential than Gebelin's.[3] In that essay De M.***'s takes De Gebelin's speculations even further, agreeing with him about the mystical origins of the Tarot in ancient Egypt, but making several additional, and influential, statements that continue to influence mass understanding of the occult tarot even to this day[citation needed]. He:
makes the first statement that the Tarot is in fact The Book of Thoth
makes the first statement that the Tarot is associated with Gypsies (and that Gypsies were roaming Egyptians)
makes the first association of Tarot with cartomancy
The cartomanic tarot emerges shortly after the publication of Court de Gebelin's and can be traced to the proselytizing work of Etteilla who:[3]
invented a method of tarot divination in 1783,
published a cartomanic treatise of tarot as the Book of Thoth,
created the first society for Tarot cartomancy, the Société littéraire des associés libres des interprètes du liver de Thot.
created the first corrected Tarot (supposedly fixing errors that resulted from misinterpretation and corruption through the mists of antiquity), The Grand Ettielle deck
created the first Egyptian tarot to be used exclusively for Tarot cartomancy
published, under the imprint of his society, the Dictionnaire synonimique du Livere de Thot, a book that "systematically tabulated all the possible meanings which each card could bear, when upright and reversed." (Dummett, 1980: pp. 110).
Etteille contributed to occult perspectives as well by making several historically outlandish claims about the Italian Tarot, further reinforcing its mystical import. Etteille[citation needed]:
suggested that Tarot was repository of the wisdom of Hermes Trismegistus
was a book of eternal medicine
was an account of the creation of the world
argued that the first copy of the tarot was imprinted on leaves of gold
Michel Dummett (1980) suggests that Etteilla was attempting to scoop Court De Gebelin as the discoverer of the occult tarot[citation needed]. Etteilla in fact claims to have been involved with Tarot longer than Court De Gebelin.[3] It is likely that the exaggerated detail of the Tarot provided by Alliette was an attempt to assert his occult and historical importance[citation needed].
The final founding figure is Mlle Marie-Anne Adelaide Lenormand. Lenormand outshone even Ettielle and was the first cartomancer to the stars (being the personal confidant of Empress Josephine, Napolean and other important people).[3] Lenormand used both regular playing cards, in particular the Piquet pack, as well as cards derived from Etteilla's Egyptian root. She was so famous that a deck was published in her name, the Grand Jeu de Mlle Lenormand, two years after her death in 1843.
The idea of the cards as a mystical key was further developed by Eliphas Lévi (1810-1875[citation needed]). Lévi (whose real name was Alphonse-Louise Constance) was educated in the seminary of Saint-Sulipice, was ordained as a deacon, but never became a priest. Dummett (1980, pp. 114) notes that it is from Levi's book Dogme et rituel that the "whole of the modern occultist movement stems." Lévi claims to have discovered a great secret, formerly hidden in ancient parables and esoteric obfuscation, and that secret is a Lux (light, or Astral light) that moves behind and is contained within all of reality[citation needed]. On the tarot, Lévi claimed to have "been the first to 'have discovered intact and still unknown this key of all doctrines and all philosophies of the old world'; 'without the Tarot', he tells us, 'the Magic of the ancients is a closed book....'" Dummett (1980, pp. 118). Lévi rejected Court de Gébelin's claims about an Egyptian origin of the deck symbols going instead back to Tarot de Marseille, called it The Book of Hermes, suggested it had immense antiquity, that it existed long before Moses, and that is was in fact a universal key of erudition, philosophy, and magic that could (and would) unlock Hermetic and Cabbalistic mysteries. According to Lévi, "An imprisoned person with no other book than the Tarot, if he knew how to use it, could in a few years acquire universal knowledge, and would be able to speak on all subjects with unequaled learning and inexhaustible eloquence.[16]
Notable contributions of Levi include:[3]
Lévi was the first to suggest that the Magus (Bagatto) was to work with the four suits (four elements) of the tarot, pentacles, swords, wands, etc..
Following the lead of de Gébelin, Lévi solidified the association of the luminal Hebrew alphabet with the Tarot keys (i.e. trumps)
Lévi linked the ten numbered cards in each suit to the ten sefiroth or divine emanations.
Suggested the court cards represented the stages of human life
Suggested the four suites represented the Tetragrammaton or divine name.
After dismissing Lévi's contribution to magic as the product of "an advanced state of intellectual deliquescent," he notes that Lévi's made a major contribution to the history of occult lore. Dummett (1980: 120). Occultists, magicians, and magus's all the way down to the 21st century have cited Lévi as a defining influence[citation needed]. This trend began immediately when Jean-Baptiste Pitois (1811), writing under the name Paul Christian, wrote L'Homme rouge (1863) and later Histoire del le magie, du monde surnaturel et de la fatalité à travers les temps et le peuples (1870). Christian repeats and extends the mythology of the tarot (i.e. Egyptian origins, cabbalistic and astrological signifiance), and comes up with different names for the trumps and the suits (see table below for a list of Christian's modifications to the trumps)[citation needed]. Batons (wands) become Scepters, Swords become Blades, and Coins become Shekels. Interestingly, Dummett (1980) singles out Christian's writing as one of the worst examples of what he calls false ascription to be found in the occult literature.[3] False ascription is the process of invoking authoritative figures from a (real or mythical) past in order to lend authority to a specific text. Notably, the problem of false ascription is not something we find just in the tarot literature. E.J. Holmyard finds the same problem in early literature of Alchemy. Holmyard notes of the authors of early alchemical texts:
In order to give some show of authority to their nebulous doctrines, alchemists busied themselves in composing treatises that they then attributed to any philosopher or celebrity of earlier times whom their whim led them to select. Thus works of alchemy were ascribed to Hermes, Plato, Moses, Miriam his sister, Theophrastus, Ostanes, Cleopatra, and Isis....Legends and myths were given alchemical interpretations; the golden fleece, which Jason and the Argonats carried over the Pontic Sea to Colchis, was was claimed to have been a manuscript on parchment, teaching the manner of making gold by alchemical art, and even the "Song of Solomon' was supposed to be an alchemical treatise couched in veiled language."[17]
Following Christian the occult tradition of tarot was carried by Ellic Howe and Marquis Stanislas de Guaita (1861-1897). Ellic Howe, under the name Ély Star published, in 1888, the book Mystères de l'horoscope. A section of the book is devoted to Tarot, however Star mostly repeats Christian's modifications. Star's primary contribution was the introduction of the terms 'major arcana' and 'minor arcana,' although he did number the Crocodile (the Fool) XXII instead of 0[citation needed]. In 1887 the Marquis Stanislas de Guaita met the amateur artist Oswald Wirth (1860-1943) and subsequently sponsored a production of Lévi's intended deck. Guided entirely by de Guaita's he Wirth designed the first neo-occultist cartomantic deck (and first cartomantic deck not derived from Ettielle's Egyptina deck). Known as the Arcanes du Tarot kabbalistique it consisted of only the twenty-two major arcana.
Shortly before Oswald Wirth published his first deck, the Marquis Stanislas de Guaita formed the Cabalistic Order of the Rosy Cross (1988) along with Dr Papus, François-Charles Barlet, and Joséphin Sar Péladan (1858-1918)[citation needed]. Prior to this there had been a general decline and degeneration of occult secret brotherhoods but de Guaita's foundaion of the Rosy Cross Order rejuvenated the occult movement[citation needed]. This is a significant moment in the development of the occult tarot since it is at this point that the Tarot enters into the temple as an important aspect aspect of ritual, in particular initiation.[3] The association of Tarot with initiation was formalized by François-Charles Barlet whose 1889 essay Le Tarot initiatique give an interpretation of the trumps as an initiatory sequence chronicling the spiritual development from neophyte to adept.[3] This was followed by the publication of Le Tarot des Bohémiens by Papus, a significant milestone because it represents the first authentic attempt to reveal the wisdom of the ancients and the divinatory excellence of the occult Tarot.[3] This may seem counter intuitive at this point but prior to the publication of Le Tarot des Bohémiens occultists had simply extolled the virtues of the Tarot as masterpiece without ever enumerating the details of the Secret Doctrine contained within. Papus's attempt is tortuous, dotted with dismissive sexism, full of EPMO (like false ascription, a common sin among esoteric writers), and fails to do anything other than read into the Tarot already established doctrine[3]

Tarot is often used in conjunction with the study of the Hermetic Qabalah.[18] In these decks all the cards are illustrated in accordance with Qabalistic principles, most being influenced by the Rider-Waite-Smith deck and bearing illustrated scenes on all the suit cards. The images on the Rider-Waite deck were drawn by artist Pamela Colman Smith, to the instructions of Christian mystic and occultist Arthur Edward Waite, and were originally published by the Rider Company in December 1909[citation needed]. This deck is considered a simple, user friendly one but nevertheless its imagery, especially in the Major Arcana, is complex and replete with esoteric symbolism[citation needed]. The subjects of the Major Arcana are based on those of the earliest decks, but have been significantly modified to reflect Waite and Smith's view of the Tarot. An important difference from Marseilles style decks is that Smith drew scenes with esoteric meanings on the suit cards. However the Rider-Waite was not the first deck to include completely illustrated suit cards. The first to do so was the 15th century Sola-Busca deck.[citation needed]
Some methods of interpreting the tarot consider cards to have different meanings depending on whether they appear upright or reversed.[19] A reversed card is often interpreted to mean the opposite of its upright meaning[citation needed]. For instance, the Sun card upright may be associated with satisfaction, gratitude, health, happiness, strength, inspiration, and liberation; while in reverse, it may be interpreted to mean a lack of confidence and mild unhappiness. However, not all methods of card reading prescribe an opposite meaning to reversed cards. Some card readers will interpret a reversed card as either a more intense variation of the upright card, an undeveloped trait or an issue that requires greater attention. Other[who?] interpreters point out that card reversal is dependent on the order of the cards before shuffling, so is of little bearing in the scope of a reading[citation needed].
A Tarot reading typically starts with the reader (self or other) shuffling the deck, and is laid out in one of a variety of patterns called spreads. This is then interpreted by the interpreter or reader. The spreads generally cover the subject's thoughts and desires (known or unknown) or past, present, and future events. Each position in the spread is assigned a number, and the cards are turned over in that sequence, with each card being contemplated/interpreted before moving to the next, and in connection with neighbouring cards[citation needed]. Each position has an interpretation indicating what aspect of the question the card in that position is referring to.
Sometimes, before being dealt, the initial card in a spread is chosen to represent the querent or the question being asked, often from the major arcana. This card is called the significator and is removed from any further role in the spread.
The following is a comparison of the order of the trumps up to and including the A.E. Waite deck. This table is based on Dummett (1980) and actual inspection of the relevant decks. You will find links to images of the tarot below.

Varney the Vampire

The cover image from one of the original Varney the Vampire publications.
Varney the Vampire; or, the Feast of Blood was a Victorian era serialized gothic horror story by James Malcolm Rymer (alternatively attributed to Thomas Preskett Prest). It first appeared in 1845–47 as a series of cheap pamphlets of the kind then known as "penny dreadfuls". The story was published in book form in 1847. It is of epic length: the original edition ran to 876 double-columned pages divided into 220 chapters.[1] Altogether it totals nearly 667,000 words.[2] Despite its inconsistencies, Varney the Vampire is more or less a cohesive whole. It introduced many of the tropes present in vampire fiction recognizable to modern audiences to this day.[3]

The story[edit]
Setting[edit]
The story has a confused setting. While ostensibly set in the early eighteenth century, there are references to the Napoleonic Wars and other indicators that the story is contemporary to the time of its writing in the mid-nineteenth century. Varney's adventures also occur in various locations including London, Bath, Winchester, Naples and Venice.

Human characters[edit]
The plot concerns the troubles that Sir Francis Varney inflicts upon the Bannerworths, a formerly wealthy family driven to ruin by their recently deceased father. Initially the Bannerworths consist of Mrs. Bannerworth and her adult children Henry, George and Flora. (George is never mentioned after the thirty-sixth chapter.) A family friend, Mr. Marchdale, lives with the Bannerworths in early chapters. Later Flora's fiancé Charles Holland and his seafaring uncle Admiral Bell along with his assistant, the extremely humorous Jack Pringle, also take residence with the Bannerworths.

The character of Varney[edit]
Though the earliest chapters give the standard motives of blood sustenance for Varney's actions toward the family, later ones suggest that Varney is motivated by monetary interests. The story is at times inconsistent and confusing, as if the author did not know whether to make Varney a literal vampire or simply a human who acts like one. Varney bears a strong resemblance to a portrait in Bannerworth Hall, and the implication throughout is that he is actually Marmaduke Bannerworth (a.k.a. Sir Runnagate Bannerworth in a classic naming confusion), but that connection is never cleared up. He is portrayed as loathing his condition, and at one point he turns Clara Crofton, a member of another family he terrorizes, into a vampire for revenge.

Over the course of the book, Varney is presented with increasing sympathy as a victim of circumstances. He tries to save himself, but is unable to do so. He ultimately commits suicide by throwing himself into Mount Vesuvius, after having left a written account of his origin with a sympathetic priest. According to Varney, he was cursed with vampirism after he had betrayed a royalist to Oliver Cromwell and accidentally killed his own son afterwards in a fit of anger, although he "dies" and is revived several times in the course of his career. This afforded the author a variety of origin stories. In one of these, a medical student named Dr. Chillingworth applies galvanism to Varney's hanged corpse and revives him. This sub-plot has an obvious similarity to the story of Frankenstein by Mary Shelley and even more so, perhaps, to much later film adaptations of the novel (the novel itself does not present electricity as Dr. Frankenstein's means of creating the monster.)

Legacy[edit]
Varney was a major influence on later vampire fiction, most notably the renowned novel Dracula (1897) by Bram Stoker. Many of today's standard vampire tropes originated in Varney: Varney has fangs, leaves two puncture wounds on the necks of his victims, has hypnotic powers, and has superhuman strength.[3] Unlike later fictional vampires, he is able to go about in daylight and has no particular fear of either crosses or garlic. He can eat and drink in human fashion as a form of disguise, but he points out that human food and drink do not agree with him. His vampirism seems to be a fit that comes on him when his vital energy begins to run low; he is a regular, normally functioning person between feedings.

This is also the first example of the "sympathetic vampire," a vampire who despises his condition but is nonetheless a slave to it. This archetype has been widely exemplified, notably by such characters as Countess Zaleska in the 1936 film Dracula's Daughter, Barnabas Collins in the TV soap opera Dark Shadows, Mick St. John in the TV show Moonlight, Louis de Pointe du Lac in Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire, Kain in the Legacy Of Kain video games, Marvel Comics character Morbius, the Living Vampire, Nick Knight in the TV series Forever Knight, Angel from the Buffy the Vampire Slayer universe, and Bill Compton in Charlaine Harris' The Southern Vampire Mysteries.

The makers of Marvel Comics were also influenced by this story. In the Marvel Universe, "Varnae" is the name of the first vampire, created by the people of Atlantis before it sank.[4]

A standard joking phrase, common today in Northern England, is possibly first recorded in Varney, where a comical character twice describes himself as having "never been backward in coming forward."

The sole member of the German darkwave band Sopor Aeternus &amp; The Ensemble of Shadows, Anna-Varney Cantodea, adopted her name from Varney the vampire.

The Shadow magazine story "The Vampire Murders" published in 1942 features "Varney Haldrew" who lives in Haldrew Hall. Varney is named after the original Varney The Vampire and spends his nights sleeping in a coffin.

Varney appears in an episode of the Canadian television show Dracula: The Series, played by Sam Malkin. He appears in the episode "Bad Blood", and treats Dracula after he is poisoned by a rare blood type.

Sir Francis Varney is the Viceroy of India in Kim Newman's Anno Dracula.

In the TV series Penny Dreadful (2014), Dr. Van Helsing gives a copy of Varney the Vampire to Victor Frankenstein, explaining that the story is more truth than fiction and that the mysterious creature the series' characters are pursuing is a vampire.

            <Title>Scene</Title>
            <Text>The Penny Dreadful was afloat above Hyde Park, looking down from a grey sky upon the deserted park-grounds. Fog roiled across the ground, casting the city in a drab palette. The rain had cleared some time in the morning, but left the thick pea soup fog in its wake. In a way, it was the perfect cover. Working in shifts, the captain and his crew had kept the Dreadful afloat throughout the night, giving Jonathan Grimmer a chance to sleep.
The Dreadful, kept aloft by a dozen ballonets filled with hydrogen, encased in a long blimp that was torpedo-like in shape. Like an overgrown ornithopter, it had huge leather wings attached to its sides. Propellers lined the ship's gondola, and sails were mounted beneath its underbelly and along its spine. The ship could sleep half a hundred passengers comfortably, not to mention the crew. Jonathan had worried about keeping the ship floating during the rainstorm, but the captain had assured him that unless lightning struck, they would be safe enough.
If Henry Charles Ocelot was right, and Parson Sinews really was innocent, then the Resurrectionists might still be looking for Jonathan. Even if Sinews was the Resurrection Man, his arrest did not mean that Jonathan was safe. He didn't know for certain that the Resurrectionists' orders came directly from the Resurrection Man. They might continue to come after him, even with Sinews behind bars. They'd seen his face. They might know who he was. They might know where he lived.
He couldn't hide forever though.
"Captain," he said.
There was a brass can in his bedroom, with a thin tube running from the can into the wall. His voice travelled down the tube and—with some scientific explanation beyond Jonathan's comprehension—reached the captain. He put the can to his ear.
"Sir?" came Captain Merrick's voice, distorted and tinny through the brass can. It reminded Jonathan of the way voices sounded when played through a gramophone.
"Take me to the Grimmer Company headquarters, please," he said.
"Yes, sir."
He hung the brass can back on its stand, as the ship answered with a groan of straining wood and rope, the grinding of gears, and a blast of steam. The ship lurched and Jonathan stumbled and grasped one of the many railings that lined each room throughout the airship. The ship pressed on and settled into a steady rhythm.
Jonathan made his way to the lounge and settled into an armchair.
The lounge was lavish, even by Jonathan’s standards. Furnished with antique furniture that was surprisingly comfortable and apparently quite expensive, at least according to Jonathan's mother. There was also a fully stocked bar. But Jonathan rang the bell for tea, deciding it was too early for a drink.
The tea arrived with a few slices of lemon and a couple of biscuits. Jonathan stirred the lemon into his tea, as he watched the darkness of London pass by through the window. It seemed, from where he sat, that it was the city that was moving and not the airship. The ship was steady enough that his teacup barely rattled as it sat on the table at his side.
The ship slowed suddenly, announcing they'd reached their destination. Jonathan swallowed the last of his tea, and rose from the armchair.
“Now arriving at Grimmer Company headquarters,” the captain’s voice resonated through the ship, coming from the speaking tubes, which wound through the ship, amplified by a set of brass cans like the one in Jonathan’s bedchamber.
Jonathan headed towards the bridge, as the Dreadful began to expel hydrogen, allowing it to lower its altitude. He ducked under a wooden strut and stepped into the noisy engine room. A wave of heat rushed over him. The engineers were busy tending to a wall of complicated machinery and shovelling coal into the furnace, goggles on their faces, drenched in sweat.
Jonathan hurried past, heading out the opposite door and grasping a railing as the ship jolted suddenly. After a moment, it settled enough that he could continue.
“You there,” he said, getting the attention of one of the crewmen. “Your name and rank, please?”
“Lockwood, sir. Kipper Lockwood. But most folks call me Kip.” He took off his hat and wiped sweat from his brow. “Midshipman, sir.”
Jonathan nodded thoughtfully.
“A pleasure to meet you,” he replied. “I’m Jonathan Grimmer.”
“Oh, I know, sir,” said the young man, a bit enthusiastically. “I mean, it bein’ your ship an’ all, I should ‘ope I would, sir.”
“Right, of course,” said Jonathan. “Of course you would. Listen, Mr. Lockwood-”
“Call me Kip, sir.”
“Kip, you seem an enthusiastic lad. I wonder if you might be amenable to completing a bit of extra work for me while the ship’s aground? I’d pay you for it, of course.”
Kip nodded eagerly.
“Yes, sir. Of course, sir,” he said. “Only, what sort of work is it, sir?”
“A friend of mine was arrested. I need you to find out where he’s been taken.”
“Sorry to hear about your friend, sir,” Kip replied.
“An acquaintance, really,” said Jonathan.
“All the same, sir. I’ll track ‘im down, notta problem, sir. I’ll start wiv Newgate, I s’pose.”
“Very good. Thank you, Mr. Lockwood,” he said, and corrected himself, “Kip.”
He shook the man’s hand, and apparently happy to have a bit of extra coin coming in, Kip hurried off through the engine room. Jonathan headed the opposite way, making his way to the front of the ship to disembark.</Text>

            <Title>Scene 73</Title>
            <Synopsis>Jonathan awakens on the airship with an awful headache. He gradually remembers what happened - Palmer knocked him out with a tranquilizer dart. Palmer is loyal to the Resurrectionists.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Jonathan sat up, nursing an awful headache. He blinked and looked around. It took a few moments, despite the familiarity of his surroundings, for Jonathan to figure out where the hell he was. He was still on the airship. Why was he still on the airship? He was supposed to be headed to the tailor across the street from the Grimmer Company, and searching for the hidden entrance to the underground facility. It was an experience Jonathan was familiar with, waking up with no recollection of how he’d gotten there, but on this particular occasion there was no smell of alcohol on his breath. He certainly had the headache and foggy memory he associated with a hangover, but he was sure he hadn’t been drinking.
As the fog cleared from his mind, he began to remember what had happened. After Miss Monday had described her plan, the crew had begun to file out the door. As Jonathan turned to leave, he’d been forestalled by a hand on his shoulder.
“A moment of your time, Jonathan?”
It was Abraham Palmer.
Jonathan pulled himself to his feet, and surveyed the empty room. The bartender had been dismissed, so Jonathan grabbed a bottle from behind the bar and took a swig to ease the ache in his head.
“Of course,” he remembered answering.
As he’d told Miss Monday, Jonathan trusted Palmer. After all, Jonathan’s parents had been so consumed by their business with the Grimmer Company that Jonathan had practically been raised by servants, and by the employees at the printing company. Palmer had been more of a father to him than Charles Grimmer ever had. Everything that he’d learned about the printing business he’d learned from Palmer.
“I’d like to ask you something, and I’d like to be direct, if I may,” said Mr. Palmer, taking a seat at the tea table and directing Jonathan to do the same. When Jonathan was settled, Palmer continued, “There was a moment in your childhood. You must have been about seven or eight years old. I wanted to know if you remembered it.”
“What moment?” Jonathan asked.
“Ah, so you don’t remember?” Palmer replied. “The doctor said you might not. You weren’t yourself at the time, after all.”
“What?” Jonathan said. He wasn’t following. Not at all.
What had Palmer meant? Jonathan took another swig of absinthe, straight from the bottle, and headed to the library, where his father had kept his gun collection. His gun had been removed from his belt.
“You were exposed to the Lazarus Virus.”
He remembered Palmer’s words, though he had no memory of the incident Palmer was describing.
“We don’t know how you contracted the virus, but it was an earlier strain. You were feverish, delirious. You weren’t yourself. It’s a blessing you don’t remember it.”
“I remember…being sick. I remember having a fever.”
“It was no ordinary fever. Under the careful ministrations of Dr. Allen, you recovered from your illness. But that was not the end of things. A servant had been bitten. She took to the fever, and was sent home to recover. Of course, she didn’t recover; she got worse. The virus spreads easily. A bite. A scratch. Jonathan’s father began trying to track down incidences of attacks involving the infected, hunting down the zombies, throwing their bodies into the Thames, and covering up their deaths. Eventually, a more sophisticated means of dealing with the virus became necessary. The virus was impossible to contain. That was why your father built the laboratory beneath the Grimmer Company. It’s also why I believe the Resurrectionists are our only chance of finding a cure.”
Jonathan felt sick. He grabbed two pistols, shoved one in his belt, and kept the other in his hand. He swallowed another mouthful of liquor, but his head still ached. He made his way to the window and looked outside. They were still moored in place, floating near the Grimmer Company.
“The first batch of the antiserum was derived from corvine birds, which possess a natural resistance to the virus. Not all animals do, you see. So, crows became a subject of interest to Dr. Allen. He believed, given their natural immunity, that they might allow him to synthesize an antiserum. Apparently his obsession was passed on to his assistant, Jack Bernhardt.”
Jonathan tried to remember how he knew that name. Jack Bernhardt? Wasn’t that the name of the man who hired Miss Monday to steal Papa Doc’s research in Haiti? The man who later became Anthony Tidkins? And wasn’t Dr. Allen his mentor? His mind was sluggish. He’d been drugged.
“Through his research, Dr. Allen became unintentionally exposed to the virus. Lazarus works in two stages. In stage one, the virus slowly kills the host body. It is only in stage two that the body becomes a zombie. As Dr. Allen was in stage one, he became useful as a test subject for the antiserum. If the Resurrectionists could cure that stage of the virus, we could harness immortality; the virus would act only to keep the body alive after death, but without the other negative side effects: necrosis, rot, the primal urge to eat living flesh.
“The infected would not be zombies, but undead. The antiserum actually showed promise. It worked to a point, preventing the virus from killing him, but it was still not a cure. Dr. Allen was dying; we were only delaying the inevitable. He believed that crows would not suffice to provide a cure. The cure had to come from humans. Humans who’d been exposed to Lazarus and survived.”
“Like me and Miss Monday, you mean,” said Jonathan.
“Yes,” Palmer answered. “Of course, Mrs. Grimmer forbid the Resurrectionists from using you as their test subject. I tried to persuade them to use only Miss Monday, to stay away from you. But Miss Monday proved elusive. But the Resurrectionists had another solution. The Dead London Project. If your mother had simply been willing to give you up, that could have been prevented. Still, once they find the cure, this will all be set to rights.”
Jonathan’s mind was whirling. So many things just didn’t add up. Even working from within, how could Palmer know so much?
“Once we find a cure, you mean? After we recover their research, we’ll find a cure, as we discussed. We don’t need the Resurrectionists.”
Palmer laughed. “Don’t be naive,” said Palmer. “The Resurrectionists have been studying the virus for years. Anthony Tidkins is still our best hope of finding a cure for Lazarus.”
Jonathan pushed his chair back a little, watching Palmer uneasily. Palmer twitched when Jonathan moved his chair.
“I don’t care,” Jonathan said, his tone challenging Palmer, brooking no argument. “We’re not getting into bed with the Resurrectionists, not after what they’ve done. They need to be stopped. We’ll find a cure without their help.”
“I was afraid you might say that,” said Palmer. “That’s why I put something in your drink.”
“What did you put in my drink?”
Whatever it was, its effects were already working their way through his body. Jonathan felt drowsy. He tried to stand. His knees collapsed. He hit the ground hard.
“Bastard,” Jonathan groaned as his eyelids grew as heavy as lead weights. “What do you intend to do?”
Palmer’s voice sounded slow, and hollow, as Jonathan lost consciousness. “Miss Monday is going to kill Anthony Tidkins, given half a chance. I intend to stop her, by any means necessary.”</Text>

	Background:	Anthony Tidkins is a pseudonym (Anthony Tidkins is the Resurrection Man in the Mysteries of London, a penny dreadful). The man’s real name is Jack Bernhardt.  Bernhardt was a child prodigy who had mastered the medical arts and taken up the trade of doctor at the age of thirteen, tutored by Dr. Allen, being estranged from his family.  With a grand vision of curing death, Bernhardt made a study of resurrection, looking into the Haitian practice of zombies. Through this pursuit, he meets Rachelle Vincent and learns about a concoction that creates the appearance of death as well as memory loss and susceptibility to suggestion. He also learns about the unliving. Later, Bernhardt becomes a member of The Resurrectionists.

Internal Conflicts:		Anthony Tidkins, perhaps once a good man, has lived an unusual life. Giving up his schooling in order to help people with his “gift,” he has devoted his life to the pursuit of science and medical knowledge. Later, he was approached by the Resurrectionists, and brought into the fold. Finally, recognized by reputable scientists, Tidkins is charmed into unethical practices, “for the good of mankind,” or “for the sake of science.”  Later, when he was asked to create a behaviour-altering drug that could make soldiers fearless, he is unknowingly force-fed his own drug. His behaviour becomes increasingly megalomaniacal, his scientific pursuits increasingly unethical.
External Conflicts:	 	Anthony Tidkins wishes to create a two-stage cure for death. Stage one is the Lazarus Virus. Stage two is an antiserum, which cures the victim of Lazarus, leaving them alive but now immune to the effects of death. However, with the Agency constantly interfering with his plans, he must come up with a way to get them out of the picture.  He creates an army of unliving men with mechanical contraptions in order to cause a distraction, while he releases the plague upon the city, in order to use the city of London as test subjects.

“How can you be so sure?” asked the Priest, “How is that even possible? How can this man be both doctor and judge?”
“Well,” said Mr. Sinews, “Keep in mind that Dr. Allen was a mad genius. Even before his personality was apparently altered by his own pharmaceutical concoction, there were aspects of his personality that were inexplicably insane. For example, he never allowed anyone to see his real face. Even when he was working as military scientist, he wore that strange mask upon his face. It was tolerated, of course, because of his unmatched intellect. Still, I hold to the theory that in spite of his intelligence, someone else was pulling the strings, if not at first, then at least after he was forced to take his own drugs.”
“I suppose it’s possible,” said the priest, pausing to formulate his words as was his habit. “I suppose it’s possible that he was put into a position of power by this unknown figure who was, as you say, pulling the strings. All he had to do was remove his mask and abandon the name associated with his crimes, and he would be as anonymous as you or me.”
“Right,” said Mr. Sinews, bitterly, “No one would recognize him without his mask. He was free to hide in plain sight.”
“Hm,” said the priest, nodding. “Yes,” he said, “It’s a perfectly reasonable theory.”
“To think,” said Mr. Sinews, “That I would be arrested by Dr. Allen for his own crimes.”
“Ah,” said the Priest, “It’s a bit like your cards predicted, isn’t it? It was your own obsession with the doctor that led you to be tangled up in this mess, wasn’t it?”
“But I agreed to give that up,” Mr. Sinews protested.
“And it’s not too late to do so,” said the priest, “Even now, I can see it in your eyes. The path of vengeance never ends well.”
“I can’t give up,” said Mr. Sinews, “Not now. Not after what he’s done to me.”
“There is an old proverb,” said Faria, “that says, ‘Before you embark on a journey of revenge, you should dig two graves.’”
Mr. Sinews laughed. “You’re right,” he said, “If I can only determine who it is that’s pulling the strings, I will dig a grave for Dr. Allen’s accomplice as well.”
“That’s not what I meant,” said Faria. He sighed. “Still, I can think of worse sins than the ones you’re contemplating.”
“Killing a man who deserves to die is not a sin. It is justice,” said Mr. Sinews.
“Only God decides who deserves to die,” Faria countered, “Still, this Doctor must be stopped. And his accomplice as well, or his crimes will continue. I suppose it makes little difference if he is stopped in the name of vengeance or justice.”
“You agree, then? Dr. Allen has to die.”
“There’s still one little thing in the way of that,” said the priest.
“The prison,” said Mr. Sinews, “Which reminds me. You still haven’t told me. Why I’m here.”
“I told you—”
“No,” said Mr. Sinews, “I mean, if I’m politically dangerous, why didn’t they just hang me?”
“Like I said. You’re an innocent man. They know it, just as you do.”
“I can’t possibly be here to alleviate their guilty conscience,” he said.
“No, you’re here to be silenced,” said the priest, “And nothing silences a man like shutting him away where his voice can’t be heard. Hanging a man. Now, that requires explanation. You can’t just hang a man without all of London knowing about it and bringing their children along to watch the spectacle. Hanging a man doesn’t silence him. As far as anyone out there is concerned, Mr. Sinews, you escaped. And by the way, you are Doctor Allen now.”
Mr. Sinews clenched his fists. “That all makes sense, Father,” he said, “But I still can’t grasp why I wasn’t simply killed discretely. The only thing I can think of is that they want me alive.”
The priest nodded, as if he were satisfied that Mr. Sinews was thinking for himself again. He dug back into his porridge and disappeared into the shadows. “I don’t have all the answers, Mr. Sinews,” he said, “Only some of them. You’re right that they want you alive, though. They wouldn’t go to all this trouble keeping you here otherwise.”
“But why?” he asked.
“If you want my advice, Mr. Sinews,” said the priest, “Get up early every morning and stretch. Keep your body limber. Not only will it help to keep you sane, but it may also be instrumental to the means of your escape.”
“Escape,” said Mr. Sinews, latching onto the word, “Yes, yes. Tell me more about escape.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene 3</Title>
            <Text>As Jonathan Grimmer stepped down onto solid ground, heads turned. It was one thing to arrive in an upscale carriage, like so many of the other guests, or to show up dressed in the finest silks money could buy. It was another thing entirely to arrive by airship. Even among the ton, the Penny Dreadful drew attention. If Prince Albert himself had arrived at the party in a velocipede, he still would not have made such an impressive entrance. Which was precisely what Jonathan wanted. If he was to gain an audience with Lord Connor, he needed to get the man’s attention. He removed his hat and with a sweeping hand, gestured his thanks to the captain above.
“Thank you, Captain Merrick,” he said, loud as he could manage. He knew he was being obnoxious, but it wouldn't be the first time Jonathan had made a scene at a party.
He returned his hat to his head and joined the lineup, while those who had been staring at him the whole time turned away and resumed their conversations as if to give the impression that they’d hardly noticed him. He flashed a cocky grin at the woman in front of him, while she hastily drew out a fan in order to give the impression that her attention had been fixed on the unseasonable warmth of the weather this evening and not on him. She blushed.
“Mr. Grimmer, I presume?” she said, indicating the company name emblazoned on the airship beneath the ship’s own name. Grimmer and Sons Publishing Inc.
“Mr. Grimmer was my father,” Jonathan told her, trying not to let it show that she’d just thrust a dagger in his heart. She couldn’t have known that the mere mention of his family name was painful. Mr. Grimmer had died recently—a tragic hunting accident. It had been less than a week since Jonathan heard the news.
The young lady gave him a smile.
“It must be a family business, then?” she asked. She curtseyed, and added, “I’m Lucy Marshall, by the way.”
“Charmed,” said Jonathan, flashing his lady-melting smile. Miss Marshall’s fan fluttered in response. “And yes, you’re quite right. Family business, although the name is a bit misleading. My father insisted on calling it Grimmer and Sons, although I’m an only child.”
Miss Marshall’s male companion turned around to join the conversation, a look of impatience on his face. The man wore arched eyebrows and had an aquiline nose. He wore a sneer on his lip.
“Solomon Grundy,” he said, tipping his hat and offering a forced smile. He placed his hand on Miss Marshall’s arm, puffing out his chest.
Jonathan snorted. “An unfortunate name,” he said impulsively, then instantly regretted it as Grundy’s eyebrows narrowed impossibly further.
As they spoke, a young gentleman bumped into Jonathan. The man asked their pardon as he barged his way through the line. They parted, letting him by, none of them quite sure how else to proceed.
“Well, that was rude,” said Grundy. “Anyway, I understand the Grimmer Company runs a number of newspapers and literary magazines, isn't that right? Quite a business, I imagine.”
“We also publish penny dreadfuls,” Jonathan said with a grin, enjoying the look on Grundy's face. Meanwhile, Miss Marshall’s eyes lit up.
The sensationalism and bloody subject matter of penny bloods were not considered to be in good taste among proper gentlemen. Jonathan was a man accustomed to the comforts of the wealthiest families in London, but he was still just a newspaper man, not exactly a respectable career among the ton. He enjoyed shocking more respectable gentlemen by talking about the source of his family’s wealth.
“Actually, I’ve only just returned to London; I’d been away, traveling, but have been summoned back to take over the business.” In fact, Jonathan had only come back to England upon hearing the news of his father’s death. “I thought I’d start by writing an article for one of the company’s journals.”
He disengaged his attention for a moment to peer ahead at the progress of the line. It was moving along quickly, Lord Connor’s servants competently ushering the guests inside. Jonathan would have hated to be stuck making small talk for long. He had enough on his mind as it was.
“Mr. Grimmer? May I ask what it is that you’re writing?”
“Sorry,” he said, returning his attention to the conversation. “Actually, I’m afraid I have an ulterior motive in attending this ball. I’m writing an article about Lord Connor.”
“Oh, really? On what subject?” asked Grundy. “I’ve known Lord Connor a long time. Perhaps I could be useful.”
Jonathan hesitated. He wanted to hear from Connor before saying anything more on the subject. In fact, this was the first time he’d told anyone that he was writing about Connor. He thrust a hand into his pocket and felt a small scrap of paper in his father’s handwriting.
Jonathan was expected to take over his father’s duties at the publishing company. His office was still full of his father’s belongings, and Jonathan had been avoiding the task of cleaning it out ever since he’d returned to London. The truth was that he hadn’t taken the family business seriously for a long time. As a boy, he’d looked up to his father. He wrote hundreds of articles and published them in his father’s paper, but Charles Grimmer had been so busy with running the company that he’d barely noticed Jonathan’s efforts. Rather than continuing to fight for his father’s attention, Jonathan had turned his back on the family business.
His mother had tried promoting him within the company, hoping that his newfound authority might give him a sense of ownership and responsibility. It had the opposite effect. By then Jonathan was more interested in seeing the world, trying his charms on beautiful women, lavishing in the life of a socialite.  Drinking, partying, traveling. His father had barely noticed; he’d given Jonathan the airship and offered him the freedom to travel, suggesting that Jonathan might attempt to make some business connections abroad. Jonathan had been on a bender in Prague when he’d gotten the news.
The last conversation he’d had with his father, they’d talked about Jonathan taking on more responsibilities with the company. Now that his father was gone, he had a nagging sense of guilt about everything. He wished he’d spent more time with his father. At least it wasn’t too late to start taking an interest in the company.
Jonathan’s assistant at the newspaper, Mr. Palmer, who had been his father’s assistant and had worked for the company for so long that Jonathan thought of him as family, had begun showing Jonathan the ropes. After all, while Jonathan was heir to the family business, he was new to it. Palmer had suggested Jonathan should gain more experience writing before taking over as editor-in-chief. Jonathan had agreed. After all, it had been years since Jonathan had written anything for the paper. He decided, in honor of his father, to publish one of his father’s unfinished stories.
His father was an extensive note-taker. There were boxes full of Charles Grimmer’s research for articles he would never write. The thought of rummaging through his father’s notes had filled Jonathan with guilt, but the thought of leaving his father’s work unpublished disturbed him even more. When he finally got around to the task, he found himself ill-suited to the endeavor. He couldn’t help but actually read each and every document in his father’s boxes. It made for slow work. He’d stayed up late into the evening, until the office grew cold, and Jonathan headed to the fireplace.
It was there that he’d found the scrap of paper, burnt around the edges, almost buried beneath a pile of burnt pages and firewood. This single scrap alone had miraculously survived. Jonathan had plucked it from the ashes and stared at it in wonder. A single phrase had been scrawled on the page in his father’s handwriting.
Lord Henry Connor is Francis Varney.
Jonathan’s father had stumbled into something deep. Jonathan felt certain of this. But something had scared him. Something had caused him to burn his note. Only a single sentence had survived. Jonathan was determined to discover what it meant.
Jonathan knew the name Francis Varney as the villain in the penny dreadful, Feast of Blood. Varney the Vampire. He also knew that the Resurrectionists—that nefarious society of mad scientists who murdered and called it experimentation—adopted the names of penny dreadful characters as their own. Did this mean Lord Connor was a Resurrectionist?
“If you see him, could you let Lord Connor know I’m hoping to speak with him?” Jonathan said, at last, avoiding the question.
His newfound friends nodded obligingly.
“Of course,” said Grundy.
Finally, they had reached the entrance, and their turn came to enter the ball. The butler held out his hand for their invitations, but Mr. Grundy stepped aside.
“After you, Mr. Grimmer,” he said.
“Thank you,” said Jonathan, as he reached into his pocket. “Now, where in the world has it gone?”
“Your invitation, sir?” said the butler.
“I had it just a minute ago,” Jonathan told him, bewildered. He was sure the invitation had been in his pocket. Anxiously, he checked his other pockets for the note from his father. He was relieved to find that it was still there.
“Not to worry,” said Grundy, flashing his own invitation. “Mr. Grimmer is with us.”
The butler sniffed. “Very well, Mr. Grundy. If you can vouch for Mr. Grimmer. Now, let me see here…” he trailed off as he checked his list. “There we are. Grimmer, Jonathan. But it says here that you’re already inside.”
“Well, as you can see, he clearly isn’t. A simple clerical error,” Grundy pronounced. Then, taking Miss Marshall’s arm, he marched inside. “Come on then, Jonathan.”
Bewildered, Jonathan nonetheless followed them inside. Grundy wore a superior expression on his face, seeming to enjoy having gotten Jonathan in without an invitation, if only so he could gloat about it. Ignoring him, Jonathan slipped his mask on, and Miss Marshall did the same. As he took in the crowded ballroom, he reminded them to keep a look out for their host.
“Of course,” said Grundy, slipping on his own mask. His was black, leather, and in the shape of a bird. A plague doctor's mask. Jonathan stared at it for a few seconds, then returned his attention to the other, numerous masked faces in the ballroom.
Saying a quick thank you for getting him in without his invitation, he turned to take his leave.
“Mr. Grimmer,” Miss Marshall called, stopping him. “The waltz is about to start, and I’m in need of a partner.”
“What of Mr. Grundy?” said Jonathan.
“Kind of you to think of me, Mr. Grimmer,” said the man in question. “But Miss Marshall will surely save the last dance for me. This one’s all yours.”
Apparently there was no way out of this. “I thank you for it,” said Jonathan. Then, taking Lucy by the hand, he led her to the dance floor. At least, this should give him the opportunity to look for Connor without drawing attention. “Any sign of Lord Connor?” he asked Lucy.
“I’ll let you know if I see him,” she replied as the dance began.
True to her word, Lucy kept her eyes peeled as they circled the revolving ballroom, scanning for their host, who was nowhere to be seen. She informed Jonathan, as they danced, to expect Connor to be wearing a stag mask. Apparently these sorts of details were printed in lady’s magazines, and evidently Lucy was current in her knowledge of social affairs. Well, she’d have to be, to be invited to Lord Connor’s at all. Still, they’d seen no one in a stag mask, and both Lucy and Jonathan were disappointed by his absence.
As the dance ended, they showed their appreciation for the musicians by joining in the applause, which all but drowned out the sound of a muffled gunshot from upstairs. It was a sound that Jonathan had heard before; his father had been a hunter. Otherwise, he might not even have noticed it. His eyes darted upwards, but when he returned his attention to Lucy, it seemed that he was alone in having heard it.
“What is it?” she asked, having noticed that Jonathan’s attention had wandered.
“Did you hear that?”
“Hear what?” she replied.
Jonathan shook his head, second-guessing himself. Perhaps it was just the clang of clockwork, a cog in the machine that rotated the ballroom.
“Never mind,” he said. “What room do you suppose that would be?” he added, pointing up in the direction the gunshot seemed to have come from.
Miss Marshall paused to think for a moment.
“Lord Connor’s study, I believe,” she replied, “Why? What is it that you heard?”
“Thank you, Miss Marshall,” said Jonathan. “Be sure to give my regards to Mr. Grundy.”
Any other night, Jonathan would have been happy to remain in Miss Marshall’s company. He might have made a contest of it, to see if he could steal her right from under Grundy’s nose. Tonight, he had other things on his mind. He beelined for the stairway, which he was relieved to see was crowded with other guests. It seemed there was a balcony upstairs, which was populated by gentlemen who had the good grace to take their cigarettes outside.
He wasn’t certain it was gunfire that he’d heard. Maybe it was nothing at all. Even so, a visit to Connor’s study was in order. If there was no one there, perhaps he would root around and find some further evidence of Connor’s association with the Resurrectionists.
As he reached the top of the staircase, he turned away from the doors that led outside to the balcony and headed instead for the gate that seemed to bar the way to Connor’s private quarters. He was relieved to find that it was unlocked.</Text>
            <Comments>So, would Jon have some emotion towards being mistaken for his father?
At this point, hasn't he had the invitation pick-pocketed from his pocket by the collision with the "young gentleman"?
I would mention this sooner with Annabel.
The other guests seem to have not heard the gunshot, yet Jonathon had. Is it merely by chance? Does Jonathon seem to have a keen sense of hearing? Or did he hear the sound and just had a strong sense of certainty? The other guests could have heard the sound but might have mistaken it for the sound of fireworks? Which they did have back in the 1800s.
Maybe more guess work with the gunshot and where it’s located? He’s very certain for a man who was the only one who heard the gunshot.</Comments>
            <Notes>There was something else, though, which made Jonathan hesitate to go to the police. Something the police had told him. His father had been killed by the Resurrectionists. If Connor was one of them…well, Jonathan didn’t know what he would do. Perhaps it was reckless of him to confront Connor head-on, but</Notes>

	Role in Story:	

	Occupation:	
Widow
     	

Physical Description:	

	Personality:	

	Habits/Mannerisms:	
     	

	Background:	
Mrs. Hatton was the eldest in the company, a woman nearing fifty years of age who had the appearance of a woman no younger than sixty. Widowed several times over by a multitude of gentlemen half again twice her age and wealth, she was now bedecked richly but garishly in the latest fashions and jewelry. Her cheeks were brightly blushed, and she wore a shade of bright pink around her eyes. Even to dine, she refused to remove her hat, a broad peacock feathered wide-brimmed chapeau which sat on an angle atop her greying auburn locks.

As she explains, “I have ever been a victim of circumstance. And as you further know, society loves to blame the victim. I am not, as rumour would have you believe, a gold-digging murderess, intent on my husbands’ fortunes. But I have been abused with that notion; I have received every sort of punishment short of being locked away, for these crimes I am supposed to have committed. I have been outcast, nay, banished, from popular society—a pariah. I have long known the truth of my husbands’ deaths, even witnessed some of them, but I have always lacked the evidence to corroborate my claims. That is my goal. That is my interest in the matter.”

Not all of this is entirely true. For instance, she did at least attempt the murder of at least one of her husbands, managing to badly burn most of his face. Furthermore, her interest in the matter of Dr. Allen has little if nothing to due with her interest in clearing her name as a gold-digger, but more to due with her suspicion that her maimed husband had not succumbed to his injuries but had later changed his surname to Allen.

            <Title>Scene 74</Title>
            <Synopsis>Roderick visits the Grimmer Company, looking for Mrs. Grimmer.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Roderick kept expecting zombies to leap out at him from beneath the hydrangeas, as he crossed the driveway of the Grimmer Company. His nerves were on edge from his numerous encounters with the hungry dead, and from too little sleep, and if he was being honest with himself, from overdoing it with the cocaine. But he blamed the Resurrectionists for Rémy’s death, and he would see them pay for it. Until then, he would just have to deal with his fraying nerves.
He jumped again as a shadow moved in his peripheral. Just a tree swaying in the wind, he reassured himself. The zombie virus wouldn’t have spread to this part of the city yet. Not if the Resurrectionists were hiding out here. They would have taken care not to distribute Lazarus in this neighborhood.
“You don’t shit where you eat,” he muttered, crassly.
A sour expression on his face, his feet feeling cramped by his shoes, he climbed the steps to the front door. He stole a glance inside the window. It looked like business as usual inside, although the place was more deserted than usual. Given that zombies were rampaging through the city, he imagined that most of the printing company’s employees had left early, either to go home to look after their families, or to get out of the city. It was difficult to imagine why anyone would have stayed to finish their work day, but if they hadn’t actually seen any zombies, they might not understand just how bad it was.
As he approached the door, he adopted the role of the beleaguered traveller. As if he’d gone through an ordeal to get here, he staggered up the steps, grasped at the door handle, and stumbled into the lobby. He panted as if with exhaustion and looked around warily for any sign of zombies. As he caught sight of the receptionist, he took a step back and gasped.
“Can I help you?” asked Mrs. Thompson, putting her hands up placatingly.
Roderick took a moment to stare fearfully at her, acting as though uncertain that she wasn’t a zombie. Of course, he could tell straightaway that she was human. The signs of affliction were obvious.
“You’re not…one of them?” he stammered.
“Is it really so bad as we’ve been hearing?” she asked. “We’ve been getting reports about the situation, but we haven’t had any incidents here. You’re quite safe now, I assure you.”
“Oh, thank god,” Roderick said, breathing an exaggerated sigh of relief. “You would not believe what I went through to get here.”
“I can imagine—” she said, and broke off, squinting at his face. “Don’t I know you?”
“Roderick Steen,” he said.
“Of course! Mr. Grimmer’s friend, isn’t that right?” she answered. “I’m sorry I didn’t recognize you right away. It’s been quite a day for me as well. I imagine you’re here to see Mr. Grimmer. I’m afraid he isn’t here. Would you like to wait here for him? I can make up a pot of tea while you wait.”
“Actually, I’m here to see Mrs. Grimmer.”
“Mrs. Grimmer?” the receptionist repeated. “I’m afraid she isn’t in, either.”
“No matter,” said Roderick. “I’ll simply wait in her office.”
Before she could object, he stepped around her, made his way into the hallway, and headed down it.
“Thank you,” he called as he continued along the hall. A moment later, he popped back into the lobby. “Which door is it?”
With an exasperated sigh, she at least took pity on him.
“Last door on the left.”
He flashed his teeth at her, mouthed the word thanks, and returned to the hallway, making his way to the appropriate door.
He stepped into the office and closed the door. As Mrs. Thompson had warned, Mrs. Grimmer wasn’t in.
Asking for directions had been a ploy. Roderick had been to the Grimmer Company often enough to know his way around. When Roderick’s father had worked for the police, Charles Grimmer had interviewed him on a couple of occasions, which is how he’d first met Jonathan. Later, when Roderick began to help the police with their investigation into the Resurrection Man’s murders, Mr. Grimmer had interview Roderick a number of times as well. Roderick had visited Jonathan at work a number of times too. There was a time when Roderick had hoped their friendship might have been more than that. For a while, he had visited Jonathan every day of the week. Eventually, he’d realized that their friendship was just that—friendship—but by then they had already become inseparable. He wondered if Jonathan had known how Roderick had felt about him.
He opened the door again, and crept into the hallway. The constant hammering of the printing machines was enough to provide him cover. Little stealth was required, and if he happened to be discovered, he figured he could always feign ignorance. Which way to Mrs. Grimmer’s office, again, he would say.
He hurried down the hall to the company library. The large room, which housed the company’s newspaper and magazine archives, as well as copies of the company’s most popular penny dreadfuls, featured a set of double doors at its entrance. Both were locked.
Roderick wished he had Miss Monday with him. If he survived this ordeal, he’d have to get her to teach him how to pick locks. He figured he could probably break in without her assistance, but it would be much easier if he didn’t have to. He decided, instead, to try a bit of masculine charm. He returned to the lobby. Mrs. Thompson looked up from her desk in surprise.
“You mentioned something about tea?” he said, flashing a smile. “You were right, of course.”
“About?”
“Mrs. Grimmer wasn’t in her office. I thought, perhaps, I could take my tea in the library while I wait,” he said. “I don’t suppose you have a key, Miss—”
“Mrs. Thompson.”
“Ah, missus,” he said, managing to sound disappointed. “You’re married, then?”
“Widowed,” Mrs. Thompson answered.
Roderick affected a little gasp of surprise. “Oh, goodness, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to pry,” he said. “I’m sorry for your loss.”
“Thank you, Mr. Steen. That’s very kind. I’ll show you to the library, and then I’ll put the kettle on. How do you take your tea?”
“Sweet,” he answered. “Very sweet.”</Text>
            <Notes>He set down his copy of Tales of Dead London, taken from Lord Connor’s mansion, folded his cane under the pit of his arm, and strode purposefully over to Mr. Grimmer’s bookshelf. Grimmer had his own copy of the penny dreadful, unremarkable on its own, but compared to Lord Connor’s edition, it was notably different in a couple of ways. First, Grimmer’s copy was larger by far, both thicker and taller. Second, while it appeared to be made of paper, there were tiny screws sticking into its spine, hidden to the unobservant but plain as day to the master detective.
He grabbed the book, thinking its interior might contain some further clue, but rather than sliding easily off the shelf, the book pulled out at an angle and clicked into place at a forty-five degree angle and would budge no further.
The book must have activated a switch, hidden behind the shelf. A hidden panel in the floor began to lift up, and the cacophonous sound of an enormous machine began to swell like the crescendo of an excessively percussive orchestra. When it was finished, a metal cage stood in the centre of the room where the hidden panel had been.
“Well, that is not what I was expecting,” Roderick observed.
The cage door opened easily. He stepped inside and looked around the strange contraption. There was a hanging lamp and a pull-switch, the only features of note. Roderick activated each in turn, the lamp flickering to life and the switch causing the machine to rattle noisily.
Barely perceptible above the din of the elevator, Roderick heard someone banging firmly on the door.
A loud voice, shouting, “Why did you let him in?”
“I’m sorry. I just thought…”
The receptionist’s voice faded until it was entirely indistinguishable against the noise of the elevator, as Roderick descended.
Well, fiddlesticks, he thought. It would have been much more convenient if he could have made it down to wherever this elevator was taking him, without anyone knowing he had discovered it. Especially if, as Roderick strongly suspected, the Resurrectionists were indeed tied to the Grimmer Company. This elevator, he thought, might be the members entrance to the Murder Club. And Roderick was most assuredly not a member. He readied his cane as the elevator rattled its way down to the basement.
Finally, just as Roderick was beginning to suspect that the elevator was actually taking him down into the ninth layer of hell, the narrow chamber widened into a room. An office, identical to the one upstairs. Luckily, the room was deserted, quiet.
He wanted to stop anyone from following him down here, but he didn’t want to destroy his only means of egress. So while it occurred to him to tamper with the elevator, he decided he would have to leave it. Which meant that he would have to hurry. He stepped out of the elevator, gave a cursory glance over the office, and headed for the door.</Notes>

	Background:	
Edward Steen, despite the degree of his alcoholism and his utter lack of manners, is a man of considerably better reputation than Ocelot—not a difficult feat, mind you. He is not a gentleman, exactly, but he has an association with Scotland Yard, not as an officer, but as a consulting detective. His interest in the matter is a bit more obvious and is scarcely worth mentioning. However, as Parson Sinews points out, he is not investigating the matter of Dr. Allen in any official capacity, but merely out of interest.
Steen seems to hold nothing but disdain for Parson Sinews and loathes Sinews’ insinuations that his profession is not entirely legitimate.

            <Title>Scene One copy</Title>
            <Text>The Penny Dreadful was afloat above Hyde Park, looking down from a grey sky upon the deserted parkgrounds. Fog roiled across the ground, casting the city in a drab palette. The rain had cleared some time in the morning, but left the thick peasoup fog in its wake. In a way, it was the perfect cover. Working in shifts, the captain and his crew had kept the Dreadful afloat throughout the night, giving Jonathan Grimmer a chance to sleep.
The Dreadful, kept aloft by a dozen ballonets filled with hydrogen, encased in a long blimp that was torpedo-like in shape. Like an overgrown ornithopter, it had huge leather wings attached to its sides. Propellers lined the ship's gondola, and sails were mounted beneath its underbelly and along its spine. The ship could sleep half a hundred passengers comfortably, not to mention the crew. Jonathan had worried about keeping the ship floating during the rainstorm, but the captain had assured him that unless lightning struck, they would be safe enough.
If Henry Charles Ocelot was right, and Parson Sinews really was innocent, then the Resurrectionists might still be looking for Jonathan. Even if Sinews was the Resurrection Man, his arrest did not mean that Jonathan was safe. He didn't know for certain that the Resurrectionists' orders came directly from the Resurrection Man. They might continue to come after him, even with Sinews behind bars. They'd seen his face. They might know who he was. They might know where he lived.
He couldn't hide forever though.
"Captain," he said.
There was a brass can in his bedroom, with a thin tube running from the can into the wall. His voice travelled down the tube and—with some scientific explanation beyond Jonathan's comprehension—reached the captain. He put the can to his ear.
"Sir?" came Captain Merrick's voice, distorted and tinny through the brass can. It reminded Jonathan of the way voices sounded when played through a grammophone.
"Take me to the Grimmer Company headquarters, please," he said.
"Yes, sir."
He hung the brass can back on its stand, as the ship answered with a groan of straining wood and rope, the grinding of gears, and a blast of steam. The ship lurched and Jonathan stumbled and grasped one of the many railings that lined each room throughout the airship. The ship pressed on and settled into a steady rhythm.
Jonathan made his way to the lounge and settled into an armchair.
The lounge was lavish, even by Jonathan’s standards. Furnished with antique furniture that was surprisingly comfortable and apparently quite expensive, at least according to Jonathan's mother. There was also a fully stocked bar. But Jonathan rang the bell for tea, deciding it was too early for a drink.
The tea arrived with a few slices of lemon and a couple of biscuits. Jonathan stirred the lemon into his tea, as he watched the darkness of London pass by through the window. It seemed, from where he sat, that it was the city that was moving and not the airship. The ship was steady enough that his teacup barely rattled as it sat on the table at his side.
He fished Lord Connor's letters out of his pocket. He'd read them a dozen times already, but his conversation with Parson Sinews last night had made the details of letters a bit clearer. With a fresh head after a night's rest, he unfolded the first of the letters once more, and let his eyes linger on the words scrawled hastily upon the pages.
"Dear Charles Grimmer," the letter began. This one, signed in Lord Connor's name, was a wedding invitation. Lord Connor and Charles Grimmer had served together in the war, and become close friends. Apparently they had lost touch since the war. "How long has it been since we served together in the war? Some ten years or more, I imagine, but it feels like much longer. A lifetime, really, don’t you think?"
Connor went on to tell his old friend about the woman he had fallen in love with, and to ask him to attend the wedding. Jonathan wondered if his father had accepted the invitation. He supposed he would never know. He set the letter aside and unfolded the second. Though the penmanship was the same, it was difficult to recognise that its author was the same as the first, so different was the subject and the tone.
Using the alias Francis Varney, Connor had written to Charles Grimmer in his capacity as editor of the Weekly Gazette. Connor's wife, Marianne Connor, had been murdered. The Weekly Gazette had reported on it. But rather than acknowledging his loss, rather than reaching out to an old friend, Connor attacked Charles Grimmer for failing to understand why Lady Connor had died.
"But Mrs. Connor’s death was not murder. It was not gruesome, heinous, violent, or criminal," Connor raved. "Anthony Tidkins' vindication is in the hands of the papers alone, and so it falls to me to explain this to you. The difference between vile murder and scientific study."
Jonathan felt sick as Connor went on to describe the Resurrection Man's experiments. He seemed to believe that the Resurrection Man's actions, in spite of their brutality, were justified because of the importance of his work. His aim was to bring back the dead. He believed he could find a way to cheat death.
Jonathan thought of what he'd learned from Parson Sinews last night. Anthony Tidkins' experiments had been funded by the military. The military had actually believed he would triumph over death. Connor had believed the same. He'd believed it so adamantly that he'd even defended his own wife's death based on the possible benefits of the Resurrection Man's work. What if, even after going into hiding amongst the Resurrectionists, Anthony Tidkins had never stopped his vile experiments?
Jonathan folded the second letter shut and picked up his cup of tea as if to take a sip. He let the cup linger at his lips, deep in thought. It was astonishing how drastically Lord Connor’s outlook had changed between writing the first and the second letter. It was as if he’d become a different person, Dr. Jekyll turned Mr. Hyde. Most disturbing was his indifference to the murder of his own wife. The joy that Marianne Connor had brought him, described in the first letter, was replaced with a dehumanizing interest in Anthony Tidkins' scientific pursuits.
It was strange that Connor—Francis Varney—had written to the Grimmer Company. The letter must have been written after the Resurrection Man went into hiding. Why write to the newspaper when they were meant to be operating in secret?


 Suppose, rather than quietly abandoning his work as he went into hiding, the Resurrection Man had actually progressed with his work?
Jonathan was treading on dangerous territory now, but he wondered…what if the military was still funding Tidkins' operation?



The ship slowed suddenly, announcing they'd reached their destination. Jonathan swallowed the last of his tea, and rose from the armchair.</Text>

            <Title>Scene One - archived</Title>
            <Text>Jonathan wasn’t easily shocked. From a young age he’d been trying his hand at the family business, writing articles for his father’s papers. As a newspaper man, Jonathan had often wound up in unusual situations. He’d interviewed adulterers, men dressed as women, murderers, and hangmen. For a man of his profession, it was important to be able to remain calm and composed in any situation. The sort of man who could think quickly on his feet. This was precisely the sort of man Jonathan had always believed himself to be.
And yet he felt utterly disarmed by the scene with which he found himself presented. He’d come here to demand answers from Lord Connor, his only real lead into the death of his father. Yet here was Connor, a bullet hole through his skull; the assassin, still beneath the body.
Perhaps sobriety was to be blamed, or insobriety, depending on how one thought of it; at any rate, he was soberer than usual, and as such more susceptible to shock. It had taken him a moment, but finally, Jonathan thought to draw a weapon. He had one, a pistol, in his belt somewhere. He reached for it, drew the gun from his belt, but the assassin was quicker. Much quicker.
“Drop it,” said the assassin, already on his feet. His voice was cold, threatening. He felt immediately compelled to obey. Slowly, taking care not to alarm his enemy, he lowered the weapon to the floor.
“Kick it over here.”
Jonathan did as directed.
When he stood, the assassin had moved closer and had his pistol aimed directly at Jonathan’s face. His own weapon had been stuffed into the assassin’s belt.
“You’ve got five seconds to tell me what you’re doing in here, before I blow you to smithereens.”
“I…I…what?” Jonathan stammered.
The assassin withdrew a watch, flipped it open, and held it up so that Jonathan could see the hands ticking. One second. Two. Three.
“You don’t know what you’ve done,” Jonathan blurted out at the last second. It wasn’t an answer to the question, not in the least, but it caused the hired gunman to hesitate.
Like Jonathan, he allowed himself a glance at Connor’s body. His only tangible lead in his investigation of the Resurrectionists, reduced to this. A pile of rotting flesh. And dead men tell no tales. Had Connor been silenced? Was that the cause of his assassination? Did the assassin know—could he know—just who it was that he’d killed? What Connor had been, the sort of people he associated with. Jonathan doubted it.
“You shouldn’t have done it,” he said, indicating the body. He knew that he was being hysterical, speaking faster than he ought to, gesturing more loudly than he would under ordinary circumstances. But what the proper etiquette was for a gentleman with a gun pointed at his head, he could not say. “You shouldn’t have killed him. Not him. Not Lord Connor.”
The assassin snorted. Apparently he had no sympathy for Jonathan’s duress. Yet he closed the pocket watch and lowered his gun.
“And why not?”
“Do you even know why you were hired to kill him?” asked Jonathan. The assassin looked at him blankly, which Jonathan took to mean no. He sighed. “You don’t ask questions when you’re hired, do you? You just do as you’re told?”
The gunman shrugged.
“I’m sorry. If Connor was a close friend of yours. If he was a good man…”
“It’s not that,” said Jonathan, genuinely surprised to hear an apology from the assassin. “It’s just that perhaps just this once you ought to have asked more questions of the men who hired you. I don’t know what they wanted with Connor, but you should know that the men Connor worked for…they’re dangerous.”
“What do you mean? Connor was just some fancy Lord. Some aristocrat. He didn’t work for anyone.”
“He did,” Jonathan insisted. “Look, would you just listen? I believe your life is in danger.”
“My life is danger,” he said eventually. “But what are you talking about? Who are you? What do you know about Lord Connor that I don’t?”
“You’ve heard of the Resurrectionists, I imagine?” asked Jonathan.
The assassin nodded. “Bunch of lunatic boffins, aren’t they?” said the assassin.
Jonathan raised an eyebrow. The man was dressed as a gentleman, but the disguise didn’t quite hold up under scrutiny. His manner of speaking wasn’t exactly gentlemanly. And that went beyond the obvious, that he was colder and rougher than the average gentleman, or that he was a hired killer.
“Lunatic boffins,” Jonathan repeated with a smirk. “I suppose that about sums it up.”
He moved into the room. Evidently this murderer, whoever he was, was a crack-shot with a pistol, and wasn’t about to let him leave without an explanation. And Jonathan preferred to do so with the lights on. He set about lighting a candle, as the lantern had gone out and the little light from the hallway was hardly comfortable for the extended conversation this was turning into.
“They are a group of likeminded men of science whose controversial theories on the nature of mortality—among other unconventional studies—have forced them to pursue their research in relative secrecy. Relative, because while the real names of the Resurrectionists and the exact nature of their research remain unknown, they’ve made headlines in the past with a series of gruesome murders committed by the most notorious of their members. Surely you’ve heard of Dr. Allen. The other members wrote letters to my father’s paper, defending him, describing his crimes as research.”
“What does this have to do with Lord Connor?” he replied, keeping an eye on Jonathan the entire time.
Jonathan would have preferred not to share this with anyone, least of all a stranger. At this point, though the handwriting was clearly a match, he wasn’t entirely sure that sufficed to prove Connor’s guilt beyond a doubt. At the very least, he’d have liked to question Connor about it. But then, he was essentially being held at gunpoint. He made his way to the door, slowly, careful not to give the impression that he was intending to flee. That gun could go off before he had a chance to get half a foot into the hallway.
He closed the door, now that the room was lit, and said quietly, “I have in my possession two letters which collectively prove that Lord Connor was a member of the Resurrectionists.”
It was impossible to judge the assassin’s reaction to this piece of information. He was masked, for one, and it was dark enough in here, even with the candle. And for another thing, his right eye was hidden behind some sort of mechanical monocle. As its clockwork gears rotated, the lens pivoted around its axis in a way that was similar to the movement of an eye. Jonathan wasn’t sure how it worked or what its purpose was, but he had the sensation that the assassin was looking straight through him.
He decided not to mention the third letter, or his suspicion that Lord Connor had been involved in his father’s murder. He held out the letters to the assassin, but the man waved his hand, dismissing the offer.
“I believe you,” said the assassin. “But so what? I’ve killed one of the lunatic boffins. Big deal.”
“Perhaps not. But remember, they are as you say, lunatic boffins. Inventors, scientists, engineers, surgeons, and all of them mad as hatters. Are these really the sort of gentlemen you’d want as your enemies?”
“Yet here you are. Are you certain you’re not the one who’s in over his head, Mr…?”
“Well, obviously I’m in over my head. That point hardly needed to be expounded upon, did it?” he exclaimed. “But I didn’t come here to kill Lord Connor. Just to ask questions. Questions which, I’m afraid, will have to remain unanswered.”
He was stalling, grasping for a name. He couldn’t very well give his real name to the assassin.
“Mr. O,” he said finally. His middle initial. As good a name as any.
“Oh?”
“Exactly,” Jonathan replied. “And you are?”
“Monday,” said the assassin, reaching out and shaking his hand. “It seems, Mr. O, that we are in this together. At the very least, for the moment. That is, assuming you would prefer to remain on my good side.”
“Are you threatening me?”
“Sorry,” said the assassin, stepping closer and drawing his pistol again. He spun the gun expertly in his hand, taking care to give the impression that it was a casual, idle gesture, though the threat was clear. “I didn’t mean to be so indirect. So let me be clear: if you cause a scene, I will destroy you. I will ensure that Lord Connor’s death is pinned on you and you alone. You will therefore have made an enemy of the Resurrectionists, on the one hand, and me, on the other. So, I’ll say it again, my new and dear friend. We’re in this together, you and me. Aren’t we, Mr. O?”
Jonathan sighed. “Yes, I suppose we are.”
“Good,” said the assassin, stepping back and thrusting his derringer back into his pocket. “So, what are we going to do about the body?”</Text>

            <Title>Scene i</Title>
            <Text>Jonathan hastened to keep pace with his friends. They had slipped between a pair of tall trees and slid down the muddy slope that led down to the river. His governess had warned him not to stray too far from the house, but Jonathan had never felt particularly inclined to listen to her, especially when doing so might interfere with an adventure.
It was raining, so the slope was slick, but Jonathan could hear his friends’ voices ahead of him. He pushed off at the top of the hill and let his momentum carry him down. He took off running when he reached the bottom, though the ground was just as slick there as it had been along the slope. More than once he nearly lost his balance and tumbled into the mud. His governess would be furious. His clothes were ruined.
The dots in the distance quickly resolved into the familiar shapes of his friends. Harry, the son of a butcher, who had earned a reputation for being somewhat of a bully and a tyrant. And James, whose father’s gruesome murder a few years after James’ birth had been the talk of the town for years. Whether it was because of his father’s murder or some other cause, James hardly ever spoke a word. Sometimes he might laugh, or smile, or nod, or gesture with his hands, but he never spoke aloud.
He had been warned to stay away from this pair. His mother called them common. She used other names to describe them too, some of them less kind: urchins, vandals, ruffians, scoundrels. Whatever she called them, it only made Jonathan want to spend more time with them. He knew how it drove her mad. Jonathan was supposed to be upper class, but he found other upper-class children tiresome.
At low tide the mud that lined the Thames was often tinted red by countless blood worms, aptly named given their reddish color. Harry, with a laugh, had bent down to scoop up a few handfuls of the reddened mud, unearthing dozens of them.
Harry’s hands were coated in mud. Red mud had slopped onto his trousers, not that anyone would notice the additional dirt. Harry lived in a constant state of filth. The blood worms wriggled in his hands.
“Disgusting,” said Jonathan.
“They’re just noodles!” Harry exclaimed.
With a laugh, he mimed eating them. Mud dripped from his hands, and some of the worms wriggled free and fell to the ground.
Jonathan’s stomach churned.
“I dare you to eat one,” said James, suddenly.
Jonathan and Harry both stared at him in silence. James never spoke. The silence stretched out into several long, uncomfortable seconds.
Harry recovered first.
“Let John do it,” he said. He held out his hands to Jonathan.
James shrugged and looked at Jonathan.
His expression must have been one of horror, but they were staring at him expectantly. Jonathan never turned away from a dare. His governess would wring his neck, of course, but he wasn’t about to back down. He didn’t wish to get any more dirt on his trousers, though, so he was careful as he leaned forward and looked at the blood worms in Harry’s outstretched hands. He picked out the smallest one.
“Alright,” he said, forcing a smile.
He lifted the worm above his head and opened his mouth. His stomach made a noise. James began giggling, while Harry started clucking like a chicken.
The worm dangled above Jonathan’s head. He gave Harry a look, silencing him. Mud dripped onto his cheek, and he wiped it away with the back of his hand.
“I’ll do it,” he said defiantly. He raised the worm above his mouth again, tilted his head back, and opened wide.
“He’s not gonna do it,” said Harry.
Jonathan stared at him defiantly. “I’m gonna do it,” he said. “Just give me a minute.”
Once he’d accepted the dare, there was no backing down. He knew he would never live it down if he didn’t make good on his promise. It’s just a worm, he told himself.
“Down the hatch,” he said. He let the worm fall into his mouth.
He could feel it wriggling. It tasted like dirt. He felt sick, but he forced himself to try to swallow. His throat closed up, tightened against his will. The worm caught in his throat.
Choking, he tried to cough the thing back up, but his throat had begun to swell, and his coughs came out only as a high-pitched wheeze. His hands went to his throat, and he tried to force it back up, but only succeeded in making things worse. He couldn't breathe at all.
His lungs began to ache, and his eyes went wide. He’d never felt so frightened. He was going to die, he was sure of it. This was how his life would end, with a foolish dare.
His friends were turning into hazy blotches of light. Dizzily, he reached out his hands, but they moved away from him. He heard James screaming. He blacked out.</Text>
            <Comments>I feel like this is choppy and combined 4 sentences into 2. Maybe divide them up by description and then action?
Using And in the beginning of a sentence is tough! It works until the second part of the second where you put, ‘and who himself.’ I would divide up into two sentences as well.
The comment about the red worms being called blood worms should be mentioned first, perhaps? It felt like an afterthought to me.

Spring-heeled Jack is an entity in English folklore of the Victorian era. The first claimed sighting of Spring-heeled Jack was in 1837.[1] Later sightings were reported all over Great Britain and were especially prevalent in suburban London, the Midlands and Scotland.[2]

There are many theories about the nature and identity of Spring-heeled Jack. This urban legend was very popular in its time, due to the tales of his bizarre appearance and ability to make extraordinary leaps, to the point that he became the topic of several works of fiction.

Spring-heeled Jack was described by people who claimed to have seen him as having a terrifying and frightful appearance, with diabolical physiognomy, clawed hands, and eyes that "resembled red balls of fire". One report claimed that, beneath a black cloak, he wore a helmet and a tight-fitting white garment like an oilskin. Many stories also mention a "Devil-like" aspect. Others said he was tall and thin, with the appearance of a gentleman. Several reports mention that he could breathe out blue and white flames and that he wore sharp metallic claws at his fingertips. At least two people claimed that he was able to speak comprehensible English.

Precedents
In the early 19th century, there were reports of ghosts that stalked the streets of London. These human-like figures were described as pale and stalked and preyed on lone pedestrians. The stories told of these figures formed part of a distinct ghost tradition in London which, some writers have argued, formed the foundation of the later legend of Spring-heeled Jack.[3]

The most important of these early entities was the Hammersmith Ghost, which in 1803 and 1804 was reported in Hammersmith on the western fringes of London; it would later reappear in 1824. Another apparition, the Southampton ghost, was also reported as assaulting individuals in the night. This particular spirit bore many of the characteristics of Spring-heeled Jack, and was reported as jumping over houses and being over 10 ft (3.0 m) tall.[3]

Early reports

Illustration of Spring-heeled Jack, from the serial Spring-heel'd Jack: The Terror of London
The first alleged sightings of Spring-heeled Jack were made in London in 1837 and the last reported sighting is said in most of the secondary literature to have been made in Liverpool in 1904.[4][5]

According to much later accounts, in October 1837, a girl by the name of Mary Stevens was walking to Lavender Hill, where she was working as a servant, after visiting her parents in Battersea. On her way through Clapham Common, a strange figure leapt at her from a dark alley. After immobilising her with a tight grip of his arms, he began to kiss her face, while ripping her clothes and touching her flesh with his claws, which were, according to her deposition, "cold and clammy as those of a corpse". In panic, the girl screamed, making the attacker quickly flee from the scene. The commotion brought several residents who immediately launched a search for the aggressor, who could not be found.

The next day, the leaping character is said to have chosen a very different victim near Mary Stevens' home, inaugurating a method that would reappear in later reports: he jumped in the way of a passing carriage, causing the coachman to lose control, crash, and severely injure himself. Several witnesses claimed that he escaped by jumping over a 9 ft (2.7 m) high wall while babbling with a high-pitched, ringing laughter.

Gradually, the news of the strange character spread, and soon the press and the public gave him the name "Spring-heeled Jack".[6]

Official recognition

A public session at the Mansion House, London (c. 1840).
A few months after these first sightings, on 9 January 1838, the Lord Mayor of London, Sir John Cowan, revealed at a public session held in the Mansion House an anonymous complaint that he had received several days earlier, which he had withheld in the hope of obtaining further information. The correspondent, who signed the letter "a resident of Peckham", wrote:




Though the Lord Mayor seemed fairly sceptical, a member of the audience confirmed, "servant girls about Kensington, Hammersmith and Ealing, tell dreadful stories of this ghost or devil". The matter was reported in The Times on 9 January, other national papers on 10 January and, on the day after that, the Lord Mayor showed a crowded gathering a pile of letters from various places in and around London complaining of similar "wicked pranks". The quantity of letters that poured into the Mansion House suggests that the stories were widespread in suburban London. One writer said several young women in Hammersmith had been frightened into "dangerous fits" and some "severely wounded by a sort of claws the miscreant wore on his hands". Another correspondent claimed that in Stockwell, Brixton, Camberwell and Vauxhall several people had died of fright and others had had fits; meanwhile, another reported that the trickster had been repeatedly seen in Lewisham and Blackheath.

The Lord Mayor himself was in two minds about the affair: he thought "the greatest exaggerations" had been made, and that it was quite impossible "that the ghost performs the feats of a devil upon earth", but on the other hand someone he trusted had told him of a servant girl at Forest Hill who had been scared into fits by a figure in a bear's skin; he was confident the person or persons involved in this "pantomime display" would be caught and punished.[8] The police were instructed to search for the individual responsible, and rewards were offered.

A peculiar report from The Brighton Gazette, which appeared in the 14 April 1838 edition of The Times, related how a gardener in Rosehill, Sussex, had been terrified by a creature of unknown nature. The Times wrote that "Spring-heeled Jack has, it seems, found his way to the Sussex coast", even though the report bore little resemblance to other accounts of Jack. The incident occurred on 13 April, when it appeared to a gardener "in the shape of a bear or some other four-footed animal". Having attracted the gardener's attention by a growl, it then climbed the garden wall and ran along it on all fours, before jumping down and chasing the gardener for some time. After terrifying the gardener, the apparition scaled the wall and made its exit.[9]

The Scales and Alsop reports

Illustration of Spring-heeled Jack, from the 1867 serial Spring-heel'd Jack: The Terror of London
Perhaps the best known of the alleged incidents involving Spring-heeled Jack were the attacks on two teenage girls, Lucy Scales and Jane Alsop. The Alsop report was widely covered by the newspapers, including a piece in The Times,[10] while fewer reports appeared in relation to the attack on Scales. The press coverage of these two attacks helped to raise the profile of Spring-heeled Jack.

Alsop case
Jane Alsop reported that on the night of 19 February 1838, she answered the door of her father's house to a man claiming to be a police officer, who told her to bring a light, claiming "we have caught Spring-heeled Jack here in the lane". She brought the person a candle, and noticed that he wore a large cloak. The moment she had handed him the candle, however, he threw off the cloak and "presented a most hideous and frightful appearance", vomiting blue and white flame from his mouth while his eyes resembled "red balls of fire". Miss Alsop reported that he wore a large helmet and that his clothing, which appeared to be very tight-fitting, resembled white oilskin. Without saying a word he caught hold of her and began tearing her gown with his claws which she was certain were "of some metallic substance". She screamed for help, and managed to get away from him and ran towards the house. He caught her on the steps and tore her neck and arms with his claws. She was rescued by one of her sisters, after which her assailant fled.[4][11]

Scales case
Eight days after the attack on Miss Alsop, on 28 February 1838,[12] 18-year-old Lucy Scales and her sister were returning home after visiting their brother, a butcher who lived in a respectable part of Limehouse. Miss Scales stated in her deposition to the police that as she and her sister were passing along Green Dragon Alley, they observed a person standing in an angle of the passage. She was walking in front of her sister at the time, and just as she came up to the person, who was wearing a large cloak, he spurted "a quantity of blue flame" in her face, which deprived her of her sight, and so alarmed her, that she instantly dropped to the ground, and was seized with violent fits which continued for several hours.[13]

Her brother added that on the evening in question, he had heard the loud screams of one of his sisters moments after they had left his house and on running up Green Dragon Alley he found his sister Lucy on the ground in a fit, with her sister attempting to hold and support her. She was taken home, and he then learned from his other sister what had happened. She described Lucy's assailant as being of tall, thin, and gentlemanly appearance, covered in a large cloak, and carrying a small lamp or bull's eye lantern similar to those used by the police. The individual did not speak nor did he try to lay hands on them, but instead walked quickly away. Every effort was made by the police to discover the author of these and similar outrages, and several persons were questioned, but were set free.[13]

The legend spreads
The Times reported the alleged attack on Jane Alsop on 2 March 1838 under the heading "The Late Outrage At Old Ford".[10] This was followed with an account of the trial of one Thomas Millbank, who, immediately after the reported attack on Jane Alsop, had boasted in the Morgan's Arms that he was Spring-heeled Jack. He was arrested and tried at Lambeth Street court. The arresting officer was James Lea, who had earlier arrested William Corder, the Red Barn Murderer. Millbank had been wearing white overalls and a greatcoat, which he dropped outside the house, and the candle he dropped was also found. He escaped conviction only because Jane Alsop insisted her attacker had breathed fire, and Millbank admitted he could do no such thing. Most of the other accounts were written long after the date; contemporary newspapers do not mention them.


Ad for Spring Heeled Jack, a penny dreadful (1886)
After these incidents, Spring-heeled Jack became one of the most popular characters of the period. His alleged exploits were reported in the newspapers and became the subject of several penny dreadfuls and plays performed in the cheap theatres that abounded at the time. The devil was even renamed "Spring-heeled Jack" in some Punch and Judy shows, as recounted by Henry Mayhew in his London Labour and the London Poor:


But, even as his fame was growing, reports of Spring-heeled Jack's appearances became less frequent if more widespread. In 1843, however, a wave of sightings swept the country again. A report from Northamptonshire described him as "the very image of the Devil himself, with horns and eyes of flame", and in East Anglia reports of attacks on drivers of mail coaches became common. In July 1847 "a Spring-heeled Jack investigation" in Teighnmouth, Devon led to a Captain Finch being convicted of two charges of assault against women during which he is said to have been "disguised in a skin coat, which had the appearance of bullock's hide, skullcap, horns and mask".[15] The legend was linked with the phenomenon of the "Devil's Footprints" which appeared in Devon in February 1855.

The last reports
In the beginning of the 1870s, Spring-heeled Jack was reported again in several places distant from each other. In November 1872, the News of the World reported that Peckham was "in a state of commotion owing to what is known as the "Peckham Ghost", a mysterious figure, quite alarming in appearance". The editorial pointed out that it was none other than "Spring-heeled Jack, who terrified a past generation".[16] Similar stories were published in The Illustrated Police News. In April and May 1873, there were numerous sightings of the "Park Ghost" in Sheffield, which locals also came to identify as Spring-heeled Jack.

Aldershot

Aldershot Barracks – North Camp, Central Road as it looked in 1866.
This news was followed by more reported sightings, until in August 1877 one of the most notable reports about Spring-heeled Jack came from a group of soldiers in Aldershot's barracks. This story went as follows: a sentry on duty at the North Camp peered into the darkness, his attention attracted by a peculiar figure "advancing towards him." The soldier issued a challenge, which went unheeded, and the figure came up beside him and delivered several slaps to his face. A guard shot at him, with no visible effect; some sources claim that the soldier may have fired blanks at him, others that he missed or fired warning shots. The strange figure then disappeared into the surrounding darkness "with astonishing bounds."[17][18]

Lord Ernest Hamilton's 1922 memoir Forty Years On mentions the Aldershot appearances of Spring-heeled Jack; however, he (apparently erroneously) says that they occurred in the winter of 1879 after his regiment, the 60th Rifles, had moved to Aldershot, and that similar appearances had occurred when the regiment was barracked at Colchester in the winter of 1878. He adds that the panic became so great at Aldershot that sentries were issued ammunition and ordered to shoot "the night terror" on sight, following which the appearances ceased. Hamilton thought that the appearances were actually pranks, carried out by one of his fellow officers, a Lieutenant Alfrey.[19][20] However, there is no record of Alfrey ever being court-martialled for the offence.[21]

Lincolnshire
In the autumn of 1877, Spring-heeled Jack was reportedly seen at Newport Arch, in Lincoln, Lincolnshire, wearing a sheep skin. An angry mob supposedly chased him and cornered him, and just as in Aldershot a while before, residents fired at him to no effect. As usual, he was said to have made use of his leaping abilities to lose the crowd and disappear once again.[22]

Liverpool
By the end of the 19th century the reported sightings of Spring-heeled Jack were moving towards the north west of England. Around 1888, in Everton, north Liverpool, he allegedly appeared on the rooftop of Saint Francis Xavier's Church in Salisbury Street. In 1904 there were reports of appearances in nearby William Henry Street.[23]

Modern sightings
In the late 1970s, residents of Attercliffe, Sheffield began to complain about a "red-eyed prowler who grabbed women and punched men." The man was said to bound between rooftops and walk down sides of walls.[24]

In south Herefordshire, not far from the Welsh border, a travelling salesman named Marshall claimed to have had an encounter with a similar entity in 1986. The man leaped in enormous, inhuman bounds, passed Mr. Marshall on the road, and slapped his cheek. He wore what the salesman described as a black ski-suit, and Marshall noted that he had an elongated chin.[25]

He was sighted again at an unspecified point after by schoolchildren in west Surrey, who claimed he was "all black, with red eyes and had a funny all in one white suit with badges on it." They also said he could run as fast as a car, and would approach dark haired children and tell them, "I want you."[26]

In February 2012, Scott Martin and his family were travelling home by taxi from Stoneleigh at about 10.30pm, when they saw a "dark figure with no features" run across the road in front of them, before climbing over a 15 ft (4.6 m) roadside bank in "seconds", near Nescot College on the Ewell bypass. The family later likened the figure to the legendary Spring-heeled Jack.[27]

Theories
No one was ever caught and identified as Spring-heeled Jack; combined with the extraordinary abilities attributed to him and the very long period during which he was reportedly at large, this has led to all sorts of theories of his nature and identity. While several researchers seek a rational explanation for the events, other authors explore the more fantastic details of the story to propose different kinds of paranormal speculation.

Sceptical positions
Sceptical investigators have dismissed the stories of Spring-heeled Jack as mass hysteria which developed around various stories of a bogeyman or devil which have been around for centuries, or from exaggerated urban myths about a man who clambered over rooftops claiming that the Devil was chasing him.[28]


Henry de La Poer Beresford, 3rd Marquess of Waterford (1840)
Other researchers believe that some individual(s) may have been behind its origins, being followed by imitators later on.[29] Spring-heeled Jack was widely considered not to be a supernatural creature but rather one or more persons with a macabre sense of humour.[4] This idea matches the contents of the letter to the Lord Mayor, which accused a group of young aristocrats as the culprits, after an irresponsible wager.[4] A popular rumour circulating as early as 1840 pointed to an Irish nobleman, the Marquess of Waterford, as the main suspect.[4] Haining suggested this may have been due to him having previously had bad experiences with women and police officers.[30]

The Marquess was frequently in the news in the late 1830s for drunken brawling, brutal jokes and vandalism, and was said to do anything for a bet; his irregular behaviour and his contempt for women earned him the title "the Mad Marquis", and it is also known that he was in the London area by the time the first incidents took place. In 1880 he was named as the perpetrator by E. Cobham Brewer, who said that the Marquess "used to amuse himself by springing on travellers unawares, to frighten them, and from time to time others have followed his silly example."[31][32] In 1842, the Marquess married and settled in Curraghmore House, County Waterford, and reportedly led an exemplary life until he died in a riding accident in 1859.

Sceptical investigators have asserted that the story of Spring-heeled Jack was exaggerated and altered through mass hysteria, a process in which many sociological issues may have contributed. These include unsupported rumours, superstition, oral tradition, sensationalist publications, and a folklore rich in tales of fairies and strange roguish creatures. Gossip of alleged leaping and fire-spitting powers, his alleged extraordinary features and his reputed skill in evading apprehension captured the mind of the superstitious public — increasingly so with the passing of time, which gave the impression that Spring-heeled Jack had suffered no effects from ageing. As a result, a whole urban legend was built around the character, being reflected by contemporary publications, which in turn fuelled this popular perception.[33]

Paranormal conjectures
A variety of wildly speculative paranormal explanations have been proposed to explain the origin of Spring-heeled Jack, including that he was an extraterrestrial entity with a non-human appearance and features (e.g., retro-reflective red eyes, or phosphorus breath) and a superhuman agility deriving from life on a high-gravity world, with his jumping ability and strange behaviour,[34] and that he was a demon, accidentally or purposefully summoned into this world by practitioners of the occult, or who made himself manifest simply to create spiritual turmoil.[35]

Fortean authors, particularly Loren Coleman[36] and Jerome Clark,[37] list "Springheeled Jack" in a category named "phantom attackers", with another well-known example being the "Mad Gasser of Mattoon". Typical "phantom attackers" appear to be human, and may be perceived as prosaic criminals, but may display extraordinary abilities (as in Springheeled Jack's jumps, which, it is widely noted, would break the ankles of a human who replicated them) and/or cannot be caught by authorities. Victims commonly experience the "attack" in their bedrooms, homes or other seemingly secure enclosures. They may report being pinned or paralysed, or on the other hand describe a "siege" in which they fought off a persistent intruder or intruders. Many reports can readily be explained psychologically, most notably as the "Old Hag" phenomenon, recorded in folklore and recognised by psychologists as a form of hallucination. In the most problematic cases, an "attack" is witnessed by several people and substantiated by some physical evidence, but the attacker cannot be verified to exist.

In popular culture

Spring-heeled Jack illustrated on the cover of the 1904 serial Spring-heeled Jack
The vast urban legend built around Spring-heeled Jack influenced many aspects of Victorian life, especially in contemporary popular culture. For decades, especially in London, his name was equated with the bogeyman, as a means of scaring children into behaving by telling them that if they were not good, Spring-heeled Jack would leap up and peer in at them through their bedroom windows, by night.

However, it was in fictional entertainment where the legend of Spring-heeled Jack exerted the most extensive influence, owing to his allegedly extraordinary nature. Three pamphlet publications, purportedly based on the real events, appeared almost immediately, during January and February, 1838. They were not advertised as fiction, though they likely were at least partly so. The only known copies were reported to have perished when the British Library was hit during the Blitz, but their catalog still lists the first one. The titles were:

“Authentic particulars of the awful appearance of the London Monster, alias Spring–heeled Jack, together with his extraordinary life, wonderful adventures and secret amours. Also an account of his horrible appearance to Miss N— and his singular letter to the Lord Mayor of London”
“The surprising exploits of Spring-Heel Jack in the vicinity of London, etc.”
“The Apprehension and Examination of Spring-Heel'd Jack, who has appeared as a Ghost, Demon, Bear, Baboon, etc.…”
Several plays where he assumed the main role were staged as well.

The most notable fictional Spring-heeled Jacks of the 19th and early 20th centuries were:

A play by John Thomas Haines, in 1840, Spring-Heeled Jack, the Terror of London, which shows him as a brigand who attacks women because his own sweetheart betrayed him.
An 1863 play, Spring-Heel'd Jack: or, The Felon's Wrongs, written by Frederick Hazleton.
Spring-heel'd Jack: The Terror of London, a 40 part penny dreadful published by the Newsagents Publishing Company in 1863, then reprinted in 1867. The only known almost complete version of this penny dreadful is in the British Library, and even this is missing part 14.
Spring-heeled Jack: The Terror of London, a serial published in Charles Fox's paper,The Boys' Standard, 1st Series, vol. 5, April, 1878. Written either by veteran author of dreadfuls George Augustus Henry Sala or by Alfred Burrage (as "Charlton Lea"). Reprinted in "The Boy's Standard" in 1885.
Spring-Heel Jack; or, The Masked Mystery of the Tower, appearing in Beadle's New York Dime Library #332, 4 March 1885, and written by Col. Thomas Monstery.
"Spring-Heeled Jack, The Terror of London," A 48-part serial published in 1886, reprinted in 1889. This was published by Charles Fox, who also published "The Boy's Standard." but the two stories are completely different. Written by Alfred Burrage (as "Charlton Lea") Fox also collected the parts together as a hardback book.
“The Mystery of Springheel Jack; or, the Haunted Grange,” by S. Clarke Hook, The Marvel, volume VIII, No. 189, June 1897. London: Alfred Harmsworth.
"Spring-Heeled Jack, The Terror of London,"The Boys' Monster Weekly, 1899. A reprint of The Boy's Standard version.
"Spring-Heeled Jack", also known as the "Spring-Heeled Jack Library." 1904. Twelve weekly issues with color covers, published by the Aldine Publishing Co.; Written by Alfred Burrage under the name, Charlton Lea.[38]
Director Paul Leni's Das Wachsfigurenkabinett (1924) presents the character as an amalgam with Jack the Ripper.
A play based on the Aldine penny dreadfuls entitled Spring-Heeled Jack, or the Terror of London, written in 1928 by surrealist Swiss author Maurice Sandoz. It was adapted into a film, The Curse of the Wraydons, which was released in 1946.
Later
Springheel Jack is the central, titular figure of The Wireless Theatre Company's award-winning[39][40] radio series, The Springheel Saga.[41][42] The first series entitled The Strange Case Of Springheel'd Jack, starred Julian Glover,[43] while Nicholas Parsons[44] features in the second, called The Legend Of Springheel'd Jack. A third series has also been recorded.

More recently, Spring-heeled Jack was a major character in Mark Hodder's Steampunk novel The Strange Affair of Spring-Heeled Jack published in 2010 as the first of three novels in the "Burton &amp; Swinburne" series. In this book many of the seemingly bizarre appearances described above are explained in the context of time travel.

Another treatment of the Spring-Heeled Jack legend is Elizabeth Bear's 2009 novelette [45] The Tricks of London.

Spring-Heeled Jack is a children's novel published in 1989 by Philip Pullman.

Spring-heeled Jack is the name of a recurring secondary antagonist that has abilities similar to the legend, in the dark fantasy book series, Skulduggery Pleasant.

He is the often mentioned nemesis of the DC Comics characters Knight and Squire, having been blamed for killing Knight's father and setting fire to London, amongst his other crimes

Originally published in 1997, characters from the Predator: Nemesis comic book micro-series refer to the predator antagonist as "Springheeled Jack".

Spring-heeled Jack appears in the Jackie Chan Adventures episode, "The Return of the Pussycat". He is depicted as a short troll who always speaks in rhyme.

"Spring-Heeled Jack" is the title of a humorous song by Lemon Demon from the album View-Monster.

In the video game Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion during the Thieves Guild quest line you are asked to retrieve the boots of a dead thief named Springheel Jak from the family crypt of a man called "Jakben, Earl of Imbel" (an allusion to the poem Jack Be Nimble).[citation needed]

Spring-heeled Jack can be summoned in the video games Scribblenauts and Super Scribblenauts.

In series five of the TV show Primeval, a raptor enters London in 1868 via an anomaly and is mistaken for Spring-heeled Jack.

The 2012 album Horseplay by UK band Lazarus &amp; The Plane Crash features the track "Spring Heeled Jack" telling a narrative from the perspective of the monster. It references several historical accounts of Spring-heeled Jack.[46]

Chapters 27 and 28 of the webcomic Gunnerkrigg Court, which focus heavily on the character Jack Hyland, are titled "Spring Heeled", in reference to the legend.[47]

Featured as a gruesome supernatural serial-killer in the Cal Leandros novel Slashback.

In the second series of the BBC One show, Luther, Luther pursues a serial killer who emulates Spring-heeled Jack.

In the Stephen King's anthology Night Shift, a serial killer who leaves no tracks in the snow is referred to as "Springheeled Jack".

Wizards of the Coast released a card called Springjack Pasture for Magic The Gathering in the July 2008 set Eventide[48]

Spring-heeled Jack appears as a villain in the popular urban fantasy series, Skulduggery Pleasant by Derek Landy

Spring-heeled Jack was used as a vigilante super hero in the style of Batman by the UK based The Hotspur comic in the late 1970s and early 1980s.[49]

Flora's Dare, the second of the Flora Segunda series by Ysabeau S. Wilce, features Springheel Jack as a wanted criminal whose power derives from a pair of possessed cowboy boots.

In episode 15, series one ("The Benders") of the American supernatural drama series Supernatural, the protagonists refer to an entity known as a Spring-heeled Jack.

In other countries
A similar figure known as Pérák, the Spring Man of Prague was reported to have been seen in Czechoslovakia around 1939-45. As writers such as Mike Dash have shown, the elusiveness and supernatural leaping abilities attributed to Pérák bear a close resemblance to those exhibited by Spring-heeled Jack, and distinct parallels can be drawn between the two entities.[29] The stories of Pérák provide a useful example of how the traits of Spring-heeled Jack have a broad cultural resonance in urban folklore. Pérák, like Spring-heeled Jack, went on to become a folklore hero, even starring in several animated superhero cartoons, fighting the SS, the earliest of which is 1946's Pérák a SS or Springman and the SS.[citation needed]

            <Text>I regained consciousness somewhat gradually. I have hazy recollections of those few moments of semi-consciousness. Blurry memories of a brightly lit room. The distinctly muffled voices of the doctors.
I remember being in a bed somewhere, twisting and turning as I woke. My head was pounding, and it was difficult to think.
I remember seeing Jack—though it might just as well have been Dr. Karnstein. I could only see him with one eye, and his face was masked.
I could hear his voice, too, but I could only make out some of the words. My ears felt like they were ringing, and they felt as if they’d been stuffed with cotton.
“No, Camille,” he said.
I had no idea who Camille might have been, although looking back it seems obvious that this was Mircalla Karnstein’s real name.
“We have to, Jack,” she said in her thick French accent. “You know we have to.”
I wondered at the use of his real name. I knew him as Jack, but I’d thought that Dr. Karnstein knew him as Anthony Tidkins.
“No,” Jack insisted. “We can fix her. It’s not too late, but we must act now.”
Whatever they said next, I cannot recall, but I do remember Dr. Karnstein asking about my eye.
And I remember Anthony Tidkins’ reply. “I can fix that too. I can fix everything.”
The next time I awoke, I felt immediately as though something was different. There was pain, to be certain, but that was not the whole of it. The world looked different. It felt different. I could see details I’d never been able to see before. The precision of my eyesight was remarkable. I felt like a blind man being given a pair of spectacles for the first time.
But as I blinked my eyes, I felt a knot in the pit of my stomach. I had the sudden recollection of a zombie digging its hands into my flesh and plucking my eye from its socket. There were no eyelashes upon my cheek when I blinked my eye. Instinctively I reached up with my arm to feel for what was wrong. That was when I saw my arm for the first time.
It was not my arm, but the arm of a machine. Well, you’ve seen it, and you know what it looked like, so I won’t describe it to you again. But I will tell you that the shock I felt at seeing what had become of my arm and feeling what had become of my eye, was utterly horrifying.
I stumbled out of bed, still unsteady on my feet, and sought out a looking glass. I found one, a small mirror that sat on the nightstand. I picked it up with my good arm and held it up to my face.
I hardly recognized myself. My hair was knotted and disheveled, as if I’d been asleep for days. My face was bruised. And there was a bright pink gash that ran down my face, intersecting that foreign object that had replaced my eye.
I reached up and explored the device with the fingers of my left hand. I was amazed that I could still see with both eyes. I could see better with that one eye than I could with the other. The effect was dizzying in its lack of familiarity. I felt my way around the device with my hand, searching for a latch or a button that would released the contraption from my face.
Eventually I found one. There was a clicking sound and the hiss of air releasing. Instantly my vision changed. I could only see with my left eye now; I was at once relieved and disturbed by the sudden change.
I felt nauseous. I began to remove the straps that kept the prosthesis in place. At last, I looked away. I could not yet bear to look at my face without at least something covering the gaping hole where my eye had been removed. There was searing pain when I moved my good eye to look away.
And there was Jack, standing in the doorway.
“How do you feel?” he asked me.
For a long time, I did not answer him. I thought the answer must have been obvious, anyway. I felt horrid. I’d lost one of my limbs. I’d lost my eye. And as I thought of those sick and wretched faces I’d cut down as they’d tried to devour me, I believed I’d also lost my soul.
“You did remarkably well,” he said.
I snorted. If that were true, I thought, I would not have lost so much.
“What have you done to me?” I asked eventually.
“I’ve saved your life,” he said. And though I couldn’t see his face through his mask, I could tell he was smiling. It was in the tone of his voice. He was proud of what he’d done. Enthusiastic, even.
Bitterly, I turned away from him.
“What happened to Papa Doc?” I said quietly.
“You don’t recall?” he asked.
I didn’t answer. My memory was blank, but I did know what had happened to Papa Doc. I knew because I remembered planning it, before blanking out. Like a fallen angel, with my black wings, drenched in blood, I’d descended onto his balcony and broken into his home. I must have found my way into his bedroom, where he slept. And waking him by quietly calling his name, I must have placed the zombie upon his bed and let it crawl towards his face.
After a while, I heard the sharp sound of Jack’s footsteps as he turned and walked down the hall, away from me.
And for a long time, I did not see him again.</Text>

            <Title>Scene</Title>
            <Text>The foyer of the Grimmer Company was quite unlike the room Annabel had spied through the windows as she’d approached the building. A wide room with dark, hardwood floors, bright wallpaper, and furniture lined with gilt, the foyer was the company’s public face, detached from the printing and copying rooms that filled the entire building with the strong scents of glue, paper, and ink, and the the cacophonous din of printing machines and a hundred typewriters at work. It was quiet enough in the foyer; thick walls dulled the sound and the smell, but every now and then, a door swung open and one of the Grimmer employees headed through the foyer, and Annabel caught a glimpse of the printing rooms, and her ears rang with the thrum of machines.
A pretty, if bookish, young woman sat behind a desk, her hair tied in a neat bun atop her head. She stood up and made her way around the desk to greet Annabel as she came in. The poor woman seemed almost flustered by Annabel’s appearance, and Annabel wondered if she’d overdone it by wearing her most expensive visiting dress.
“May I help you, Miss…?”
“Monday,” Annabel offered. “And thank you, yes. Or at least, I hope so. I’m looking for a man…”
“Aren’t we all?” said the receptionist, and then caught herself. Her mouth widened in surprise, and she blinked in surprise as if she couldn’t believe what she’d just said. She covered her mouth with her hand. “I mean…I, well, I…”
Annabel spared her with a conspiratorial wink.
“Not just any man,” she said. “I’m looking for Mr. O.”
“Oh!” the receptionist replied, adjusting her spectacles to look at Annabel properly. To her credit, she managed to look at Annabel without appearing to stare at her clockwork eye or seeming to notice her scars. “Oh, I see. Let me guess, you’ve read an article of his that interested you?”
Annabel smiled. So Mr. O was a writer; already she was getting closer to learning his identity. This was proving to be easier than she’d thought.
“Actually,” she said, leaning in an putting her hand on the receptionist’s arm, as if they were old friends sharing secrets. “He and I were recently introduced at a party. I’m afraid I didn’t get his real name.”
“Oh,” said the receptionist, blushing. “Well, I can help you there. Mr. O is Jonathan Grimmer’s pen name.”
Annabel made an effort to keep her expression neutral as she took in the information. She’d been right about Mr. O; he was someone important within the Grimmer organization. He was a Grimmer!
“Does he have an office here?” Annabel ventured. “Would you let him know I’m here?”
The secretary gave a nod. She was ever so helpful, Annabel thought.
“Let me just see if he’s in,” she said, gesturing for Annabel to take a seat while she waited. There were a couple of chairs in the corner of the room, centred around a small coffee table with a couple of newspapers on top. “Can I get you something while you wait? Tea? Coffee?”
Annabel shook her head, but offered an appreciative smile. “Thank you, you’ve been very helpful.”
Annabel took a seat, and waited until the receptionist headed out through the door on the left. The foyer was a symmetrical room, with a door on the left and a door on the right. As soon as the receptionist was out of sight, Annabel was out of her chair. She took a moment to rummage through the drawers of the reception desk. She stuffed a set of keys into her pockets, just in case they might come in handy. Then she headed to the door on the left.
It opened to one of the printing rooms. The printers seemed too absorbed in their work to even notice Annabel. Annabel could imagine that this would be a busy day for a newspaper company, given the events of last night. The noise of the machines disguised the sound of the door opening, and those who happened to look up at Annabel’s entrance, quickly returned their attention to their work. She looked down the hallway and saw the receptionist knocking on a door of one of the offices.
Annabel headed through the printing room toward the hallway, taking care not to be seen by the receptionist; suddenly her fancy clothes seemed incredibly conspicuous, even if they’d proved handy only a minute ago. She headed into the hallway, leaving the printing room behind. There were a number of offices along the way, each marked with a nameplate with the name and position of the employer whose office it was. She ducked into an alcove as the receptionist turned in her direction. She didn’t think she’d been seen, but she wasn’t sure.
She glanced at the nameplate on the door. This office belonged to Abraham Palmer, Assistant Editor. Annabel hoped he wasn’t in. It might be a bit awkward barging into his room unannounced, but better than being caught sneaking down the hallway by the receptionist. She tried the door, but it didn’t open.
Annabel cursed under her breath. The hallway wasn’t that long. If the receptionist was heading her way, she’d be on her in a moment. The alcove wouldn’t be deep enough to hide her when the receptionist was right beside her. She remembered the set of keys she’d tucked away in her pocket and hoped that one of them would open Mr. Palmer’s office.
She took out the ring of keys and tried the first. It didn’t fit. She swung the key along the ring, and tried the next. This one fit, but it didn’t turn the lock. She pulled the key from the lock. It was gold, had a round head, and was long. There were only three other keys on the ring that looked like it. She decided to try those next. She slid one of them into the lock. Again, it failed to turn. She could hear footsteps now, approaching. They must have been incredibly close, given that she could hear them above the din of the printing machines. She tried not to panic as she fit the next key into the lock. To her relief, it turned. She swung the door open, hurried into the room, and closed the door behind her, breathing heavily.
The room was dark, the lights off. Wherever Mr. Palmer was, at least he wasn’t in his office. Annabel took a moment to catch her breath, then turned to head back into the hallway. As she put her hand on the latch, she felt it turn. Someone was about to open the door!
Quickly, she clicked the lock into place, and the latch clicked. Without a moment to lose, she reached up to adjust the dial on her clockwork eye so she could see more clearly in the dark. A green lens slid into place, replacing the opaque one that she normally used in daylight. She took in the details of the room, and quickly settled on a hiding place. A closet. She slid open the closet and stepped inside, as a set of keys jiggled in the locked door. She slid the closet closed, as the door to the room opened.
She could see only through a slender crack in the closet door, but she could make out two distinct figures. She guessed that one of them was Mr. Palmer. The other was a woman. They were deep in conversation. Annabel held her breath and listened.
They were talking about Lord Connor. She tensed. Then she reminded herself that of course the Grimmer company would be interested in Lord Connor’s death.
“Don’t say anything to Jonathan,” said the woman. “I don’t want him involved in any of this.”
The lights went on in the room. Even so, it was difficult to see through the crack in the closet door. The woman was standing by the bookshelf. Mr. Palmer was standing beside her. Their voices were all but drowned out by the thrum of machinery. There was a mechanical clang of steel and a rumbling in the floor that seemed to be coming from below. Perhaps there were more printing rooms in the basement.
“He’s already involved,” said Palmer. He had an American accent and a bit of a gravelly voice. Annabel guessed he was in his late fifties, judging from the voice. The woman was probably around the same age.
“I have it on good authority that he was there,” Palmer continued. “He escaped via airship, but he was in the room with Lord Connor. They would have killed him if he wasn’t your son, you know.”
Annabel covered her mouth as she realized they were talking about Mr. O. It was difficult to think of him as Jonathan Grimmer. The woman, she realized, was Jonathan’s mother, Mrs. Grimmer. And it sounded an awful lot like she was involved with the Resurrectionists. How else would she and Mr. Palmer know the Resurrectionists had seen Jonathan in Connor’s study? And why else would they have spared Jonathan for being Mrs. Grimmer’s son?
She’d come here to try to determine whether or not Mr. O had told the police what had happened at Lord Connor’s, but it seemed she’d gotten more than she’d bargained for.
She couldn’t make out what Mrs. Grimmer said next. Her voice was drowned out as machinery rattled and clanged. It sounded like the printing machine was right inside the room. As the noise abated, Annabel still couldn’t hear their voices. It became almost quiet, and still, Annabel couldn’t see or hear Mr. Palmer or Mrs. Grimmer. They might have left the room. This might be her best chance to get out of here. She counted to fifteen, then thirty, and still didn’t hear their voices.
At last, she opened the door. To her relief, they were gone. But now there was a wide gap in the floor, and a tall structure of steel and brass rose up out of it.
“What on god’s green earth?” she muttered.
The structure was like a tall metal cage, cylindrical, with the missing section of the floor as its roof, beneath which was a dark shaft that must have led to the building’s basement. A cable ran down the shaft from the top of the metal cage, seeming to operate on a pulley system. The cable was running even now, the pulley revolving as the machine worked.
She could hear the sound, loud even against the din of the printing press from down the hall, of enormous gears turning from somewhere well below. It was almost like the sound of a clock tower, or the turning wheels of a locomotive. The mechanical clang of an enormous machine in operation.
“A secret elevator,” she realised, even as it descended.
The metal cage disappeared into the floor, filling the missing section of the floor with a hiss of air. The crease in the floor was just barely visible, and only then because Annabel knew what to look for.
She put her hand on the floor, and ran it along the length of the crease. There was no latch, no dial, nothing to indicate how to turn the elevator on.
She looked around the room. There had to be a switch somewhere, even it was hidden. She scrutinized the office, exploring each inch first with her eyes and then with her hands, picking up this item and putting it down, then picking up that item, looking behind it and putting it back where she’d found it again. Where in the blazes was the switch? She cursed in frustration, fruitlessly picking up books in order to check the wall behind the panel, just as one book suddenly stood out.
A penny dreadful publication called Tales of Dead London. Its author was unnamed, but the name of its publisher was printed along the spine. Grimmer &amp; Grimmer Books. An imprint of the Grimmer &amp; Sons Printing Company, Annabel assumed.
Annabel had read some of the stories from the dreadful when she was first learning to read. If she recalled correctly, it had originally been published serially, each issue appearing in a periodical magazine, with a number of different writers continuing to write the stories after its original author passed away. Later, the stories were collected and reprinted in a thick paperback volume of nearly four hundred pages. In the stories, the dead rose from their graves and ate the flesh of the living.
Most of the books on the shelf had been collecting dust. But Tales of Dead London was not the least bit dusty. Which meant that unless it had only recently been added to the library, the book had recently been handled. Annabel picked it up now. As she did, the heavy mechanical sound of revolving gears and gyrating pulleys announced that the elevator had started up again.
She looked to see the floor begin to separate once more, the hidden panel lifting up to reveal the hidden cage into which the elevator would soon rise. In her hand, the book refused to lift from the shelf. It was affixed to the shelf, connected to a lever with little brass screws sticking into its spine. The book was no book at all. It wasn’t even made of paper, she realized with surprise.
Finally, the elevator finished its ascent, and Annabel let go of the book. It snapped back into place with a slight clicking sound.
Annabel opened the door of the cage, and stepped nervously into the elevator. She looked around the inside of the cage for some sort of lever that would operate the machine, and eventually found it. She reached up to pull the lever. She gave a start as the elevator shuddered and began to descend into the dark elevator shaft.</Text>
            <Comments>I like having a book trigger the secret elevator.  It’s a cliche, sure, but it’s one of the best.  I’ve even used it, myself, right down to the clue of the book in question being less dusty.

            <Notes> If Annabel guessed correctly, the building likely had a circular layout, with identical hallways leading from the foyer to the southeast and southwest corners, then heading north to the opposite corners, and meeting again in the room directly opposite the foyer.</Notes>

            <Title>Scene Two - archived</Title>
            <Synopsis>“And anyway, what makes you think I was hired to kill Lord Connor?”
“Because!” he protested, as if that was explanation enough. He held out his hands, as if at a loss. “Well, for starters, you’re far too calm, too composed, too…too…”
</Synopsis>
            <Text>Annabel stooped down to get another look at Lord Connor. She had to roll him onto his back to do so, and he was heavy. Damn heavy. She heaved him onto his back. She almost recoiled. She’d practically forgotten the vision of horror that was Lord Connor’s face. If he had always been so hideous or if it was the illness that had so badly disfigured him, Annabel did not know.
He was in his sixties, Annabel guessed. His face was whiskered, and his white hair was stained with blood. His skin was mottled and grey, and in places it was cracked and blemished. His eyes were white. His nose was broken where she’d kicked him, and there was an exit wound at the back of his skull. She shuddered and stepped back. She hated that she was so disturbed by dead bodies.
He would be difficult to move, she thought. She looked to Mr. O for ideas and to remind him that her gun could be out of its holster in an instant if he even considered fleeing the room.
“Now, just hold on a minute. I’ve told you my business here,” said the gentleman. “I believe it’s your turn to be forthcoming. Why have you killed Lord Connor?” After a pause, he added, “Who hired you?”
Annabel took a moment to examine her ally by circumstance. Perhaps she ought to have done so earlier, but but he was proving to be both resourceful and clever, and Annabel didn’t wish to be caught off guard.
Tall by Annabel’s standards, broad-shouldered, and with an athletic frame, his very posture exuded confidence that bordered on arrogance. He was immaculately dressed in rich tones of grey with hints of blue on his ascot. His eyes too, she noted, were blue, so the ascot was well matched. He wore a top hat, black, with a grey ribbon. His clothes were rich and perfectly tailored. He moved gracefully, and smiled charmingly; he wore only a half-mask, leaving the majority of his face bare. It was a handsome one as well, clean-shaven, with strong, masculine features.
She caught a whiff of absinthe on his breath, close as they were to one another, which meant that he was not without his vices. This, thought Annabel, was to his favour. She held perfection in the highest disdain, and Mr. O seemed otherwise to be tottering on the very edge of perfection. She snorted her disdain and criticized the very thing she appreciated about him.
“Your breath smells of anise,” she said.
“Beg your pardon?” he objected.
“You’re an absinthe-drinker?” she said.
“Oh, anise,” he said, careful to enunciate.
“What did you think I said?” Annabel retorted. “And anyway, what makes you think I was hired to kill Lord Connor?”
“Because!” he protested, as if that was explanation enough. He held out his hands, as if at a loss. “Well, for starters, you’re far too calm, too composed, too…too…”
“Professional?” she offered. Speaking of which. She grabbed the chair from behind Connor’s desk. It was heavy, but she managed to drag it over to the door and wedge it under the latch.
“That is absolutely not what I was going to say, but that is the general idea, yes. You have obviously done this sort of thing before, but you don’t seem like a madman.”
“I’ll take that as a compliment,” Annabel replied, again looking at the body. They really ought to do something about the body, but Annabel was still at a loss as to a solution, and at the moment, no one else seemed to have heard the gunshot or noticed Lord Connor’s absence. So instead she kept her ears open for anyone that might be coming, and kept her eye on Mr. O. “You deal with a lot of madmen?”
“In my line of work, yes. I’m a writer, Mr. Monday, of the journalistic variety. I deal with the insane whenever possible.”
“I suppose you would,” Annabel admitted. “Madness certainly sells papers.”
“Yes, and then of course there’s your disguise,” said Mr. O, getting back on topic.
“My disguise?” Annabel exclaimed.
“Don’t get me wrong. It’s very good. You look every bit the gentleman. It’s your speech that gives you away.”
Annabel cursed herself. She’d been speaking far too much, and what with all the excitement, she’d probably let her voice squeak back into its usual upper register. She dropped it down an octave, “What about my speech?”
“Well, it’s obvious you’re no aristocrat, are you?” he replied, to Annabel’s relief. “No offence intended, of course.”
“None taken, of course,” said Annabel with a snort. “Anyway, while you are correct in that my business with Lord Connor is of a professional nature, I was not hired to kill Lord Connor. Only to rob him.”
“Oh,” said Mr. O, clearly surprised by the revelation. Then, gesturing casually at the body, he added, “Well, you’ve cocked that up quite nicely, haven’t you?”
Annabel rolled her eyes. Who was he to criticize her work? As if he could have done the job any better.
“He attacked me!” she said in her defence.
She didn’t know why she felt like she had to defend herself to him. Honestly, she didn’t know why she was still talking to him at all. She ought to be either getting rid of the body or just getting herself the hell out of this precarious position.
Ordinarily, she might have thought to use her feminine wiles to get her out of the situation. In her particular line of work, a flirtatious gesture, a hand gently placed on a gentleman’s shoulder, or a coy smile could go a long way. Even with her disfigured face—the scar that ran down her cheek, her prosthetic eye—she could open doors. She could calm an otherwise dangerous situation, such as this one. Gentlemen, she’d learned, were particularly gullible creatures. All it took was the slightest of gestures, and suddenly they’d turn from adversary into fierce protector.
Tonight, of course, she’d favoured the gentleman’s disguise, preferring the freedom a man’s social status offered her, the ability to enter a party unattended, to wander Lord Connor’s halls without question, to hire a cab without a discerning glance from her driver. But the advantage of the costume was not without its flaws. Unless Mr. O was of a very particular persuasion, she could not possibly hope to flirt her way out of this situation. And if you can’t beat them…
“There was something wrong with him. He was sick,” she added.
And besides, Annabel thought, Connor’s death hardly meant that he couldn’t still be robbed. She made her way over to the safe. This would be much more difficult now that she could no longer demand the safe’s combination from its owner. But she set to work cracking it.
Mr. O shrugged. Judging from Connor’s appearance, and from his nauseating stench, that much was obvious.
“Sick how?” he asked. “Tuberculosis? Ergotism?”
“Something else, I think. He was trying to eat me,” she offered by way of example.
“He what?” Mr. O exclaimed.
“Look, this isn’t really the time, is it? What are we going to do with the body?”
He nodded, looked at the body silently, and scratched his chin thoughtfully. He held up a finger, as if to say hold that thought, and made his way to the window, drew aside the curtains, and opened the latch. A cool breeze drifted into the room, causing the curtains to ripple like waves and the paper on Connor’s desk to dance. The lilting voices of ladies and deep baritone laughs of gentlemen could be heard from somewhere below, but Annabel was still focused on cracking the safe, her ears pressed up so close that she could hear the mechanisms inside, clicking.
“Come over here a moment, would you?”
“Almost…” she said, ignoring him. She swivelled the safe’s lock into the correct position and heard the satisfying click. “Got it.”
She pulled the door open and hastily withdrew a thick, yellow envelope.
Setting it triumphantly upon the desk, she joined Mr. O and looked out. In the yard, just a few feet from them, an airship was secured to a tree. It was elegant and sleek in design, with propellors of polished brass mounted along its length and sails beneath its gondola.
“Are you insane?” said Anabel, looking at her newfound companion in astonishment. “I presume this vessel is yours?”
“I like to travel in style,” he replied, looking out at the airship and pretending not to have noticed her annoyance.
“Have you no concept whatsoever of the word clandestine? The idea is to avoid attention, not draw it. Are you honestly suggesting we throw him in your dirigible and just fly away? You don’t think anyone might notice?”
He shrugged. Annabel crossed her arms and tapped her foot.
“Well, yes, I’ve always found the airship draws a bit more attention than I’d care for. To be honest, I hardly ever use it. It does seem a lucky coincidence that it’s parked just outside the window though, doesn’t it? When weighed against the option of dragging Connor’s body downstairs, through the ballroom, and out the front door, hoping nobody will notice, flying him away in a conveniently located airship doesn’t seem like such an absurd option, does it?”
Annabel snorted. Well, when he put it that way, the plan wasn’t as idiotic as it seemed upon further consideration, but still, the airship was certain to draw attention.
“Fine,” he said at last, “Then I suppose you’ve got a better idea?”
“I do, actually.” Returning to Connor’s desk, she turned away from him, removed her own mask and replaced it with one that was dark plum, the leather shaped to look like a stag’s head.
“Stay here,” she said, adopting a voice that better suited Lord Connor’s advanced age, “I’ll have one of my servants fetch a cart and some extra serving clothes. Then we’ll simply hide him on the trolley and wheel him out of here, simple as that.”
“You never met Lord Connor when he was alive, did you?” asked Mr. O. “Just a hint of an Irish accent.”
“How’s this?” she tried again.
He nodded. “Better.”
“Good.”
With a smile, she grabbed the envelope off the desk and headed to the door. She removed the chair and instructed him to replace it after she’d gone.
“Back in a moment,” she said. “I’ll rap three times softly upon the door when I return, so you’ll know it’s me.”
Before she shut the door, she handed him back his gun.
A moment later, she abandoned the stag mask, replaced her own, and made her way discreetly downstairs, where she would quietly slip through the door. Mr. O would have to deal with the body on his own. He could fly him away in the airship for all she cared, so long as she was not on it.</Text>
            <Comments>There is a pattern I'm noticing with how you describe characters and rooms. Maybe break it up a bit? Reveal slowly the hotness that is Jonathan? Maybe Annabel notices certain things as they clean up the mess?
Does this mean she can see the names on the ship? Has Mr. O given himself away?</Comments>

            <Title>Scene ii</Title>
            <Text>When he regained consciousness, there was a man with a bird’s face standing at the side of his bed. Behind him, a pale white boy with blonde hair, about his own age or perhaps a few years older, stood against the wall, looking shyly back. Jonathan offered up a weak smile, but the boy turned away from him, busying himself with his work. He had a jar of leeches in one hand and a doctor’s surgical bag in the other. He set the jar down on the table beside the man in the bird's face.
Jonathan leaned back on his pillow and looked up at the man with the bird’s face. His face was made of dark leather, and it was strapped to his head with shiny brass buckles. He had glass lenses for eyes. Jonathan remembered seen pictures in books of doctors who would wear this style of mask in the times of the plague, but he never knew doctors still wore them. He wondered if he was still asleep, if this was something his feverish mind had dreamed up. The candle flickered, casting strange shadows upon the wall.
He tried to sit but the doctor pressed a gloved hand against his chest and forced him back down. He was cold even beneath the blankets, but he was sweating. The doctor had a thermometer in his hand. He placed it on the bedside table and turned back to Jonathan.
Jonathan wanted to ask him what was happening, but his own voice sounded strange to him. Incoherent. Slurred. He had a vague recollection of choking on something. The blood worm. He remembered gradually losing consciousness, and he remembered the frightened faces of his friends as they turned and ran. He didn't know if they'd run to get help or if they'd just abandoned him.
He tried to sit up again, but was stopped once more by the doctor’s hand.
“Restrain him,” said the doctor. His voice sounded strange, too, filtered through the leather plague mask, but a moment later a servant entered the room with a set of leather straps in hand.
Forgetting that the doctor’s hand was still pressed hard against his chest, Jonathan tried again to sit up, and when he met the resistance of the doctor’s hand, he grew more desperate in his need to sit. He grabbed at the doctor’s hand with his own, tried to pry his arm from his chest, but his efforts were in vain.
While the doctor pinned him down, the servant and the doctor’s assistant began to tie the straps around him, binding him to the bed. Three straps, one around his waist, one around his legs, and now the servant moved to tie one around his chest.
Jonathan heard the sound of an animal snarling. The girl stumbled back. She stared at him in alarm, her eyes wide and frightened, and it took Jonathan a moment to realize she was afraid of him. He hadn’t even realized he’d done it, but he was sure that sound had come from him. He couldn't explain it, but there was a part of him that wanted to kill her. No, not kill her. Eat her. It was an uncontrollable, unshakable need, a desperate animal instinct that frightened him.
The girl took a moment to catch her breath, and the blonde boy came up from behind as if to help her. She nearly jumped out of her skin.
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to—” he began.
“It’s alright,” she said. “I’ve got it.”
She bent to buckle the straps in place. She moved in close to tie them up tight. She smelled like meat. Jonathan's stomach growled hungrily. What was wrong with him?
Her hands worked quickly, and she was almost finished with the buckle. Eat her, screamed the voice in his head.
“Stop it,” he said, gritting his teeth. “Leave me alone.”
He had to warn them. They didn’t seem to realize the danger they were in. He was scared he would hurt them.
“What’s that?” said the servant, bending down to hear him better. “Did you hear that? He just said something.”
The smell of her breath was torment. He felt like a caged animal. He needed to get out of these straps. He tried to sit up suddenly. The doctor still had his hand on Jonathan’s forehead, but he was caught off guard by Jonathan’s sudden movement. His hand slipped from Jonathan's forehead.
That single moment was all it took. Before he could stop himself, Jonathan sunk his teeth into the girl’s throat and clamped down. Blood spurted into Jonathan’s mouth as his teeth scraped through skin and tore out a chunk of meat from her neck.
She screamed. She grasped her neck with both hands and stumbled back. She looked down at the blood on her hands, and dropped to her knees, looking unsteady, like she might faint.
The doctor’s assistant, the pale blonde boy, cried out in alarm. Only the doctor seemed to keep his wits.
“Get a bandage, boy,” he instructed, “Stop the bleeding.”
Jonathan watched the scene impassively. He knew this girl would probably die, and he knew that it was his fault. He should feel guilty. But he had meat in his mouth, and it was warm and sweet.</Text>

            <Text>Dr. Jekyll, née Dr. Allen

	Role in Story:	Antagonist
	Occupation:	Doctor/Inventor

Physical Description:	

	Personality:	

	Habits/Mannerisms:	
 	

	Background:	The chief antagonist of Allen’s Street, Doctor Allen is a deranged doctor who has become a sort of bogeyman figure in popular culture. Believed to be no more than an urban legend made up to scare children away from wandering down unfamiliar streets, the Doctor is supposed to have been hired to conduct research into a pharmaceutical drug that might somehow provide a strategic military advantage, whether by altering a soldier’s psychological state or by similar means. Instead, Doctor Allen, a sociopath and con man, begins conducting unsanctioned medical experiments of a surgical nature on unwilling subjects and leaves their deceased bodies on display for all to see, like trophies.

The bodies are typically hideously disfigured, have undergone amputations, decapitations, disembowelment, and have had numerous mechanical and animal parts surgically attached in ways that cause the bodies to act as puppets or even automatons

Note: An automaton (plural: automata or automatons) is a self-operating machine. The word is sometimes used to describe an old-fashioned robot, more specifically an autonomous robot.

When the body of Rachelle Vincent turns up dead in the fashion of Doctor Allen’s victims, it becomes clear that Doctor Allen does exist. The question…“who is Doctor Allen?” becomes the central plot point of Allen’s Street. The police believe Parson Sinews to be the real Doctor Allen and Rachelle Vincent's murderer.

As a further twist, Doctor Allen’s supposed address is 44 Allen’s Street – a fictional address that turns out to be real. It also turns out that Parson Sinews lives on Allen’s Street.

Formerly known as Dr. James Vane, George Allen is a pseudonym. Like Anthony Tidkins, George Allen is comprised of the names of a penny dreadful character and an actress (George from ???, Allen from Viola Allen)

            <Title>Henry Charles Ocelot</Title>
            <Text>Henry Charles Ocelot

	Role in Story:
Support (Acquaintance of Mr. Parson Sinews and member of Mr. Sinews’ secret society.)
	Occupation:
Owner of several establishments where a man might indulge himself in any number of deadly sins. For example, Mr. Ocelot had somehow managed to produce documents which supported his claim of being a legitimate pharmacist; his customers and clients were his patients, and they affectionately dubbed him The Apothecary. And in return, he doled out prescriptions for opium and cocaine—for a price, of course. Prostitution and gambling were also among his business ventures, and Ocelot was a genius at business, marketing, and against all odds avoiding around inconveniences like legality, morality, and the fact that he was a former Haitian slave.
 	

Physical Description:
The former Haitian slave and plantation worker had rough skin and scars covering most of his night-black face. The man’s thickly muscled neck was adorned with a necklace of brass-painted bone. His right eye was red as blood—even the whites of his eye were red. When he smiled, it revealed a set of yellowing teeth, many of them chipped or filled with gold.

	Personality:
Stoic

	Habits/Mannerisms:
Despite Ocelot’s questionably moral business practices and appearances, the man himself was the perfect gentleman. Articulate, intelligent, and sharp-witted, he had a voice that was rich and deep but utterly smooth.
 	

	Background:	

HC Ocelot is a former slave turned trader and the owner of several opium dens. A friend and associate of Parson Sinews.

A disreputable gentleman, he deals mainly in opium, but has recently expanded his wares to include both heroine and the white powder made from the coca leaf that we call cocaine.

Haitian in origin, Henry Ocelot is also a practitioner of that dark Haitian magic known as Hoodoo.
At one point, Charles was taken captive by Dr. Allen, who intended to use him in his experiments. Charles later escaped.

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>Years Ago

Parson woke from his sleep to discover that the world was shaking with the tremendous force of an earthquake. At first he thought that he’d woken from one dream and had gotten caught in another.
But he had not. The world around him was rocking back and forth, the floor beneath him unsteady.
“Priest,” he whispered, “Are you awake?”
The priest groaned. “I am now,” he complained.
The priest got out of bed and moved unsteadily across the floor toward the bars that separated them. “Whoa,” he said, losing his balance and nearly falling to the ground.
“What’s going on?” Parson asked, his voice still instinctively a whisper because of the intense darkness. From the window in Faria’s cell, he saw flashes of light that must have been lightning, but of course he could not see out. “Are we at sea?” he wondered, “Is this a floating prison?”
“Ah,” said the priest, “So you’ve noticed. The ground beneath our feet is unsteady as a ship in a storm, eh, young man?”
“Yes, well, I’d like to know what’s going on,” said Parson, a bit harshly.
“Yes, I suppose you would,” said Faria, not taking offence, “You’ve noticed the floors of the prison moving before, haven’t you? Thought it was your mind playing tricks on you? It wasn’t.”
“We are at sea then?” Sinews asked, getting out of bed and trying to get a better look at the flashes of lightning through Faria’s window. “We’re in some sort of floating prison?”
“After a fashion, I suppose, yes,” said the Priest, “Why don’t you come over here and take a look?”
Parson laughed. “Now I know why they call you the Mad Priest,” he said, “It wouldn’t be called a prison if I could just leave my cell.”
“Even the most secure of prisons has its faults,” said the priest, “Why not let this be an opportunity to prepare for your eventual escape? You’ve been stretching, each morning, as I advised, have you not?”
“Yes,” said Mr. Sinews, “I have. Although I fail to see what that has to do with anything.”
“Well,” said the priest, gesturing to the food slot in Mr. Sinews’ cell door, “Why don’t you see if you can fit through that door?”
Mr. Sinews laughed. “You are insane,” he exclaimed. “You want me to fit through that tiny slot in the door?”
“Tiny?” said the priest, “It’s really not so small as that, is it? Big enough to fit your head through, anyway, and once your head and shoulders slide through, getting the rest of your body through should not prove too difficult. Especially considering how thin you’ve gotten, starved on prison rations as you are.”
“Making the vast leap of logic that it might be plausible,” said Mr. Sinews, “What about the guards?”
“Surely by now you’ve come to have some sense of their routine,” said Faria, “You know exactly how often and how long it takes them to make their rounds, don’t you?”
“I suppose I do,” said Mr. Sinews.
“Well then,” said the priest, “What are you waiting for?”
He stared at the priest, lit by lightning, and shook his head, laughing at himself. “I must be as mad as you are, old man,” he said.
“Madder,” said the priest.
Mr. Sinews moved away from his constant companion and toward the door on his cell. He slid the metal grate open and peered into the slot in the door. As he continued to stare at it, with the floor moving beneath him and the dark lightening in intermittent flashes of sudden brightness, the absurdity of it took hold of him, until he began to laugh.
It was uncontrollable. Impossible to stop. “Yes,” he said, laughing hysterically, “I must be. I must be mad as a hatter.”
“We all have our moments,” said the priest.
Eventually, the laughter died down. “Well then,” he said, “It’s difficult to judge the time of day with this storm overhead, but I suspect I have at least an hour before the guards make their next round.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene 8</Title>
            <Text>He looked out the window, down at the city below. He still felt that same tingling sensation in his nerves when looking out at this height. As he’d told Monday, he didn’t often travel by airship. If it could be helped, he’d have preferred just about any other method of transportation. Carriage, train, bicycle. Foot, even. He headed for the bar. A dash of absinthe and he’d feel right as rain.
He tapped a finger on the bar to get the barman’s attention, and gestured for the bottle. There was always the possibility that it was the night’s episodes that had so worn his nerves: Lord Connor’s death; meeting his killer, Mr. Monday; being pursued by Resurrectionists; jumping out of the window. Even thinking about it made him long for the warmth of a drink in his belly. 
He gestured to the barman with his finger, making an upward motion at his glass.
“Bit more.”
The barman filled it a bit more.
“Bit more,” Jonathan repeated.
Glug glug. The barman added another ounce.
“Bit more.”
At last satisfied with his lot, he slid his drink from the counter.
“No sugar this time, Mr. Grimmer? No water? That’s an awful nasty drink taken straight like that, if I may say so” said the barman.
Jonathan emptied his glass in a few quick gulps and set it back down on the counter. The barman’s eyes widened, even as Jonathan wiped his mouth with one hand and slid the glass forward for a refill with the other.
“Sure, why not? Sugar and water sounds great. Thank you, George,” he said, when his glass had been refilled.
He watched as George set about placing an absinthe spoon atop his glass. He set a sugar cube upon the spoon, slid the glass beneath the fountain, and allowed Jonathan to top up. Jonathan turned the spigot and watched the ice-cold water hit the sugar cube and flow into his glass. The absinthe took on a milky consistency and filled the air with the sweet scents of anise, fennel, and wormwood. It was not just the drink that stilled Jonathan’s nerves. It was the entire ritual of drinking absinthe. The sweet aroma, the exotic green that swirled inside his glass.
He settled into a nearby chair, while the airship’s captain piloted the ship across the vast urban sprawl of London. It would be a quick trip; his destination was not far from Lord Connor’s home at Lincoln’s Inn Fields in High Holborn. The airship was unhindered by traffic and Jonathan had little concern of running into the police so long as he was airborne. They were bound for Soho, the address of one of Jonathan’s longtime friends. Jonathan hated to call unannounced, especially at such a late hour, but his friend kept late hours anyway. Besides, desperate times…</Text>
            <Comments>Suggestion—to keep with consistency and the flow of the story, he should continue to refer to Annabel as Monday or Mr. Monday as this is the alias she gave him.
hey, absinthe is my potion of choice, no filching ! ;) but if you will, look up absinthe fountains, they're cool</Comments>
            <Notes>Allen’s Street. The name had been unfamiliar to him until recently, but not to Captain Merrick, who seemed to know the city as well as he did the dirigible. He had come by the name in the same manner in which he’d discovered Lord Connor’s letters. He’d been rifling through his father’s office. Sorting through a pile of advertisements that were to be posted in the Classified section, he’d found one that struck him as unusual.
Unusual, yes, but that was true of many ads. As for this one, he hadn’t even set it aside. It was not until he stumbled across the second of Lord Connor’s letters - the one that was signed pseudonymously, and which adhered to the Society’s manifesto - that he marked the advertisement as significant. He had to dig through the pile again to find it.
“I am aiming to form a Vigilance Committee. Much like the now-famous Vigilance Committee formed by George Lusk, ours will be dedicated to tracking down and capturing one of society’s most notorious of criminals, who roams these streets even now. It is not Jack The Ripper I wish to apprehend, however, but of an even deadlier fiend, and a cleverer one. Dr. Allen. Given the dubious legality of the unsanctioned formation of this committee of vigilantes, I have elected neither to share my name, nor the name of the meeting place. Instead, I put it to those sufficiently dedicated to find me at the Tea House on the street with no name. This Saturday, midnight.”
Jonathan fished his watch out of his pocket and found, to his profound relief, that he would still be able to arrive punctually.
According to Captain Merrick, Allen’s Street was the local name for the small side-street off of Fleet, which had no official name or signage. It was Allen’s Street by reputation alone, as that was where the alleged murderer had lived. The Captain, unlike Jonathan who would not ordinarily have been caught dead in the district, had been born and raised in Whitechapel, and so, knew its streets and its secrets intimately.
Jonathan, conversely, knew very little about Dr. Allen at all. He knew that the man was associated with the Resurrectionists, and he knew that the man was wanted for murder. The rest of what he knew or thought he knew about the doctor was based on conjecture, urban legends, penny dreadfuls, and colourfully embellished journalism. His plan, therefore, was to gather information. Anything that might help him catch his father’s killer and clear his name in Connor’s death. Connor had been his best lead. Now that he was dead, Dr. Allen was his only lead.
The letters themselves wouldn’t be enough to prove that Connor had been a Resurrectionist. Jonathan’s doubts had been swiftly washed away by the plague doctors showing up at Connor’s masquerade. According to the penny dreadfuls, the plague doctors masks were trademarks of the Resurrectionists - but he needed more than that.
It was safe to assume that Connor’s death had something to do with his connection to that secret society, even if Monday really had only been sent there to rob him. Jonathan drained his glass and stifled a cough.
“Arriving at our destination, sir,” came Captain Merrick’s voice, thin and distorted from the metal pipes through which it was conveyed. “Please prepare to disembark.”[ Mr. O is friends with Roderick Steen, who he knows works with the police. He decides to pay Roderick a visit and tells him about Lord Connor’s death. Roderick, who has worked on the Dr. Allen case, lets Mr. O know about the Vigilance Committee meeting, which Roderick had planned to attend himself (due to his interest in solving the Dr. Allen case), and suggests he attend. He warns Mr. O that the Resurrectionists will be looking for him now. The only way to ensure his safety is to help catch Dr. Allen and the Resurrectionists.]</Notes>

            <Title>Scene 16</Title>
            <Synopsis>Annabel intends to interrogate Bertram Melbourne, who apparently sold her out to the Resurrectionists, but he’s been killed, a threatening message left behind for her.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Annabel stifled a cough as she marched up the walkway to the door of the gentleman’s club. She had a membership here, under the assumed name of Mr. Monday, so it was convenient that she was already dressed in masculine garb. She’d been half tempted to head straight home, change out of her blood-stained clothes, and climb into bed. Instead, she had decided to pay a call on the gentleman—if gentleman was the appropriate word—who’d informed her of a potential buyer for a mysterious package, inconveniently located in Lord Connor’s safe.
At the time, he’d made no mention of who the buyer was. Of course, she’d since learned that they were Resurrectionists. She wanted to know if Melbourne had known the danger he’d put her in by setting her up with such an unpredictable buyer, or if he’d made the arrangements with good intentions. If he was as surprised as she’d been by what the Resurrectionists had done, perhaps he could be forgiven, provided he was more cautious in the future. On the other hand, if he had known they intended to rob her, or if he’d known what she was stealing, she would have to have strong words with him. Very strong words indeed.
Annabel had taken the underground railway to Chancery Lane Station. It was only a few blocks from the station to the gentleman’s club. She now stepped up to the premises and rapped firmly upon the door. It creaked open, its rusty hinges yielding to the force of her right hand. She stepped back in surprise. Cautiously, she put her head through the doorway and peered inside. It was dark, but that was not unusual for the Melbourne Club, its tables lit by oil lamps. But it was quiet, which was unsettling.
Typically loud with the gossiping voices of gentlemen and the clack of billiards, the Melbourne Club was now as quiet as the grave, its door unmanned and unlocked. The door still swung easily on its hinges as Annabel stepped inside and surveyed the club’s dimly lit quarters.
It was not entirely deserted after all. Standing behind the bar, a rictus grin on his stiff face, was the very man she’d wanted to see. Bertram Melbourne.
“Bertie,” she said familiarly, approaching him warily. She could see, even in the dim light, that something was gravely wrong.
He inclined his head at the sound of her voice, but his movements were unnatural. She stepped back in a panic, drawing her pistol, but he made no further movement toward her. When her heart settled, she turned to the nearest table, reached for the oil lamp, and adjusted the dial until it brightened.
The sudden illumination revealed the gruesome horror that had been hidden in the darkness. Annabel covered her mouth with her hand and repressed the urge to let out a scream. Melbourne had been disemboweled. With surgical precision, his gut had been cut open. Around the opening, a porthole, like that on a steamship, had somehow been affixed to his flesh like a window into the man’s insides. Hollowed like a jack o’ lantern, Melbourne’s insides had been stuffed with clockwork parts, which ticked behind a pane of glass.
No stranger to the fusion of flesh and machinery, Annabel’s eyes were not drawn to Melbourne’s clockwork stomach, but to his face. The blood had dried, but that made it no less gruesome. His eyes had been plucked out. The sockets were stuffed with black marbles. Black feathers had been stuck to his skin with a sticky resin. His nose and mouth were hidden beneath a beak made of brass. Gears were affixed to the joints of the beak.
She thought immediately of the Resurrectionists and their plague masks. When Annabel was a little girl, an orphan on the streets, stealing from men’s pockets, one of her victims had been a rich gentleman.
Although she’d gotten away with his coin purse, she had the distinct feeling he’d let her get away. The next time she met him, he’d come to her rescue, after she’d been caught red-handed stealing. After that, they’d become thick as, well, thieves. In fact, there was a time when Annabel had thought of him as her brother.
He had often worn an old, weathered plague mask. At the time, she didn’t know what the mask was for. Now that she did, she felt sickened by the memory.
Not that Annabel was squeamish. Of course, she did feel a healthy amount of nausea at the sight of Melbourne’s disfigurement, but her curiosity overpowered any sense of discomfort.
While Connor had been a zombie, Melbourne was definitely dead. He couldn’t harm her. His legs were affixed to the floor, pinned in place by metal stakes, meant to keep him upright after death.
She noticed he had a set of clockwork gears affixed to his face. She wondered if the gears did anything. After all, what was the point in clockwork if not to operate some kind of machine? Annabel reached up, put her hands on the gears attached to Melbourne’s brass beak. The gears wouldn’t turn. Her brow creased. She leaned in for a closer look, and saw that there was a keyhole. If there was a keyhole, there had to be a key.
I wonder, she thought, drawing the brass key she wore around her neck. She almost chided herself even for thinking it, ridiculous as it seemed, but she decided there was no harm in trying. She slid the key into the lock; it was a perfect fit.
She had little time to consider what this meant, as the gears rotated, and Melbourne’s crow-like mouth opened. But a thought did occur to her. It was a notion she’d been trying to avoid, but the evidence was damning. Anthony Tidkins, the Resurrection Man, who had turned Melbourne into an automaton, must have been the same man who’d given Annabel her mechanical eye all those years ago. Otherwise, how would he have designed the keyhole as a perfect match of the key she kept around her neck?
A recording began to play. It began with the sound of a crow cawing. This was the first time Annabel had been witness to the marvel of auditory recording technology. There must have been a tiny phonograph, hidden somewhere within the brass mouth.
The crow sounds gave way to a man’s voice. It was impossible to discern whose voice it was, given the quality of the recording. It was tinny, thin, without any weight to it.
“The angels, not half so happy in heaven, went envying her and me. Yes, that was the reason, as all men know, in this kingdom by the sea, that the wind came out of the cloud by night, chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.”
She shrunk back, startled by the message’s use of her own name. Annabel was hardly a student of poetry, but she was familiar enough with that verse, about the death of a beautiful woman. The message was clear; it was a warning.
The wind came out of the cloud, she thought. The Lazarus virus had been an airborne cloud, chilling and killing Lord Connor’s guests. Annabel had only just escaped that fate.
Annabel hadn’t wanted to admit it, but she kept coming back to the same horrific conclusion. She knew who the Resurrection Man was.</Text>
            <Comments>description here clashes with scene 50
This is good here.
Is her key a generic turn key used for winding?  That is the only reason I can think of as to why she would not be surprised.  Even if this was left for her to find, how would the person who made the automaton get a perfect match of the key that she keeps on her person?</Comments>
            <Notes> So when Anthony Tidkins’ brutal murder spree was linked to the Resurrectionists, Annabel had read all every article in every newspaper she could get her hands on. She knew whose work this was. This was the work of the Resurrection Man.</Notes>

Tower Bridge (built 1886–1894) is a combined bascule and suspension bridge in London which crosses the River Thames. It is close to the Tower of London, from which it takes its name, and has become an iconic symbol of London.
The bridge consists of two towers tied together at the upper level by means of two horizontal walkways, designed to withstand the horizontal forces exerted by the suspended sections of the bridge on the landward sides of the towers. The vertical component of the forces in the suspended sections and the vertical reactions of the two walkways are carried by the two robust towers. The bascule pivots and operating machinery are housed in the base of each tower. The bridge's present colour scheme dates from 1977, when it was painted red, white and blue for Queen Elizabeth II's silver jubilee. Originally it was painted a mid greenish-blue colour.[1]
The nearest London Underground station is Tower Hill on the Circle and District lines, and the nearest Docklands Light Railway station is Tower Gateway.[2]
Contrary to popular belief, the song "London Bridge Is Falling Down" has nothing to do with Tower Bridge, instead referring to the collapses of other various London Bridges.[3]

Elevation, with dimensions
In the second half of the 19th century, increased commercial development in the East End of London led to a requirement for a new river crossing downstream of London Bridge. A traditional fixed bridge could not be built because it would cut off access by tall-masted ships to the port facilities in the Pool of London, between London Bridge and the Tower of London.
A Special Bridge or Subway Committee was formed in 1877, chaired by Sir Albert Joseph Altman, to find a solution to the river crossing problem. It opened the design of the crossing to public competition. Over 50 designs were submitted, including one from civil engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette. The evaluation of the designs was surrounded by controversy, and it was not until 1884 that a design submitted by Sir Horace Jones, the City Architect (who was also one of the judges),[4] was approved.
Jones' engineer, Sir John Wolfe Barry, devised the idea of a bascule bridge with two towers built on piers. The central span was split into two equal bascules or leaves, which could be raised to allow river traffic to pass. The two side-spans were suspension bridges, with the suspension rods anchored both at the abutments and through rods contained within the bridge's upper walkways.
The bridge was officially opened on 30 June 1894 by The Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VII), and his wife, The Princess of Wales (Alexandra of Denmark).[5]
The bridge connected Iron Gate, on the north bank of the river, with Horselydown Lane, on the south – now known as Tower Bridge Approach and Tower Bridge Road, respectively.[6] Until the bridge was opened, the Tower Subway – 400 m to the west – was the shortest way to cross the river from Tower Hill to Tooley Street in Southwark. Opened in 1870, Tower Subway was among the world's earliest underground ('tube') railway, but closed after just three months and was re-opened as a pedestrian foot tunnel. Once Tower Bridge was open, the majority of foot traffic transferred to using the bridge, there being no toll to pay to use it. Having lost most of its income, the tunnel was closed in 1898.[7]
Tower Bridge is one of five London bridges now owned and maintained by the Bridge House Estates, a charitable trust overseen by the City of London Corporation. It is the only one of the Trust's bridges not to connect the City of London to the Southwark bank, the northern landfall being in Tower Hamlets.

Construction started in 1886 and took eight years with five major contractors – Sir John Jackson (foundations), Baron Armstrong (hydraulics), William Webster, Sir H.H. Bartlett, and Sir William Arrol &amp; Co.[8] – and employed 432 construction workers. E W Crutwell was the resident engineer for the construction.[6]
Two massive piers, containing over 70,000 tons of concrete,[4] were sunk into the riverbed to support the construction. Over 11,000 tons of steel provided the framework for the towers and walkways.[4] This was then clad in Cornish granite and Portland stone, both to protect the underlying steelwork and to give the bridge a pleasing appearance.
Jones died in 1887 and George D. Stevenson took over the project.[4] Stevenson replaced Jones's original brick façade with the more ornate Victorian Gothic style, which makes the bridge a distinctive landmark, and was intended to harmonise the bridge with the nearby Tower of London.[6] The total cost of construction was £1,184,000[6] (£114 million as of 2013).[9]



Tower Bridge viewed from the top of London City Hall.
The bridge is 800 feet (244 m) in length with two towers each 213 feet (65 m) high, built on piers. The central span of 200 feet (61 m) between the towers is split into two equal bascules or leaves, which can be raised to an angle of 86 degrees to allow river traffic to pass. The bascules, weighing over 1,000 tons each, are counterbalanced to minimise the force required and allow raising in five minutes.[citation needed]
The two side-spans are suspension bridges, each 270 feet (82 m) long, with the suspension rods anchored both at the abutments and through rods contained within the bridge's upper walkways. The pedestrian walkways are 143 feet (44 m) above the river at high tide.[6]

The original raising mechanism was powered by pressurised water stored in several hydraulic accumulators.[10] The system was designed and installed by Hamilton Owen Rendel[11] while working for Sir W. G. Armstrong Mitchell &amp; Company of Newcastle upon Tyne. Water, at a pressure of 750 psi (5.2 MPa), was pumped into the accumulators by two 360 hp (270 kW) stationary steam engines, each driving a force pump from its piston tail rod. The accumulators each comprise a 20 inches (51 cm) ram on which sits a very heavy weight to maintain the desired pressure.
The entire hydraulic system along with the gas lighting system was installed by William Sugg &amp; Co Ltd., the well known Westminster gas engineers. The gas lighting was initially by open flame burners within the lanterns but soon after was updated to the later incandescent system.[12]
In 1974, the original operating mechanism was largely replaced by a new electro-hydraulic drive system, designed by BHA Cromwell House. The only components of the original system still in use are the final pinions, which engage with the racks fitted to the bascules. These are driven by modern hydraulic motors and gearing, using oil rather than water as the hydraulic fluid.[13] Some of the original hydraulic machinery has been retained, although it is no longer in use. It is open to the public and forms the basis for the bridge's museum, which resides in the old engine rooms on the south side of the bridge. The museum includes the steam engines, two of the accumulators and one of the hydraulic engines that moved the bascules, along with other related artefacts.
During World War II, as a precaution against the existing engines being damaged by enemy action, a third engine was installed in 1942:[14] a 150 hp horizontal cross-compound engine, built by Vickers Armstrong Ltd. at their Elswick works in Newcastle upon Tyne. It was fitted with a flywheel having a 9-foot (2.7 m) diameter and weighing 9 tons, and was governed to a speed of 30 rpm.[14] The engine became redundant when the rest of the system was modernised in 1974, and was donated to the Forncett Industrial Steam Museum by the Corporation of the City of London.[14]
To control the passage of river traffic through the bridge, a number of different rules and signals were employed. Daytime control was provided by red semaphore signals, mounted on small control cabins on either end of both bridge piers. At night, coloured lights were used, in either direction, on both piers: two red lights to show that the bridge was closed, and two green to show that it was open. In foggy weather, a gong was sounded as well.[6]
Vessels passing through the bridge had to display signals too: by day, a black ball at least 2 feet (0.61 m) in diameter was to be mounted high up where it could be seen; by night, two red lights in the same position. Foggy weather required repeated blasts from the ship's steam whistle.[6]
If a black ball was suspended from the middle of each walkway (or a red light at night) this indicated that the bridge could not be opened. These signals were repeated about 1,000 yards (910 m) downstream, at Cherry Garden Pier, where boats needing to pass through the bridge had to hoist their signals/lights and sound their horn, as appropriate, to alert the Bridge Master.[6]
Some of the control mechanism for the signalling equipment has been preserved and may be seen working in the bridge's museum.

Although the bridge is an undoubted landmark, professional commentators in the early 20th century were critical of its aesthetics. "It represents the vice of tawdriness and pretentiousness, and of falsification of the actual facts of the structure", wrote H. H. Statham,[15] while Frank Brangwyn stated that "A more absurd structure than the Tower Bridge was never thrown across a strategic river".[16]
Architectural historian Dan Cruickshank selected the bridge as one of his four choices for the 2002 BBC television documentary series Britain's Best Buildings.[17]

Tower Bridge is sometimes mistaken for London Bridge,[18] the next bridge upstream. A popular urban legend is that in 1968, Robert McCulloch, the purchaser of the old London Bridge that was later shipped to Lake Havasu City, Arizona, believed that he was in fact buying Tower Bridge. This was denied by McCulloch himself and has been debunked by Ivan Luckin, the vendor of the bridge.[19]

Road
Tower Bridge is still a busy and vital crossing of the Thames: it is crossed by over 40,000 people (motorists, cyclists and pedestrians) every day.[21] The bridge is on the London Inner Ring Road, and is on the eastern boundary of the London congestion charge zone. (Drivers do not incur a charge by crossing the bridge.)
To maintain the integrity of the structure, the City of London Corporation has imposed a 20 miles per hour (32 km/h) speed restriction, and an 18 tonne weight limit on vehicles using the bridge. A camera system measures the speed of traffic crossing the bridge, utilising a number plate recognition system to send fixed penalty charges to speeding drivers.[22]
A second system monitors other vehicle parameters. Induction loops and piezoelectric sensors are used to measure the weight, the height of the chassis above ground level, and the number of axles of each vehicle.[22]
River
The bascules are raised around 1000 times a year.[23] River traffic is now much reduced, but it still takes priority over road traffic. Today, 24 hours' notice is required before opening the bridge. There is no charge for vessels.
A computer system was installed in 2000 to control the raising and lowering of the bascules remotely. It proved unreliable, resulting in the bridge being stuck in the open or closed positions on several occasions during 2005 until its sensors were replaced.[21]



Interior of high-level walkway (used as an exhibition space)
The high-level open air walkways between the towers gained an unpleasant reputation as a haunt for prostitutes and pickpockets; as they were only accessible by stairs they were seldom used by regular pedestrians, and were closed in 1910. In 1982 they were reopened as part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition, a display housed in the bridge's twin towers, the high-level walkways and the Victorian engine rooms. The exhibition charges an admission fee. It uses films, photos and interactive displays to explain why and how Tower Bridge was built. Visitors can access the original steam engines that once powered the bridge bascules, housed in a building close to the south end of the bridge.

In April 2008 it was announced that the bridge would undergo a 'facelift' costing £4 million, and taking four years to complete. The work entailed stripping off the existing paint down to bare metal and repainting in blue and white. Each section was enshrouded in scaffolding and plastic sheeting to prevent the old paint falling into the Thames and causing pollution. Starting in mid-2008, contractors worked on a quarter of the bridge at a time to minimise disruption, but some road closures were inevitable. It is intended that the completed work will stand for 25 years.[24]
The renovation of the walkway interior was completed in mid-2009. Within the walkways a versatile new lighting system has been installed, designed by Eleni Shiarlis, for when the walkways are in use for exhibitions or functions. The new system provides for both feature and atmospheric lighting, the latter using bespoke RGB LED luminares, designed to be concealed within the bridge superstructure and fixed without the need for drilling (these requirements as a result of the bridge's Grade I status).[25]


After facelift - September, 2010
The renovation of the four suspension chains was completed in March 2010 using a state-of-the-art coating system requiring up to six different layers of 'paint'.[26]



Tower Bridge with 2012 Olympic rings lit up at night
The bridge featured in publicity for the 2012 Summer Olympics being held in London. In June 2012 a set of Olympic rings was suspended from the bridge to mark one month to go until the start of the games. The rings cost £259,817 to make, measured 25 by 11.5 metres (82 by 37.7 ft) and weighed 13 tonnes (14 short tons).[27]
On 9 June 2012 an AgustaWestland AW-139 (G-OLYM) flew three times through Tower Bridge while being filmed from a second helicopter for a segment of the opening ceremony entitled Happy and Glorious.[28]
Professional footballer David Beckham piloted a dramatically illuminated Bladerunner BR RIB35X sportsboat, carrying the female footballer Jade Bailey and the Olympic Torch at the bow, under the raised bascules of the bridge during the ceremony. As they transited the crossing, fireworks exploded from the bridge.[29][30]
On 8 July 2012, the west walkway was transformed into a 200 foot long Live Music Sculpture by the British composer Samuel Bordoli. 30 classical musicians were arranged along the length of the bridge 42 meters above the Thames behind the Olympic rings. The sound traveled backwards and forwards along the walkway, echoing the structure of bridge.[31][32]
The Rings were removed from Tower Bridge following the Olympics, but were soon replaced by the emblem of the Paralympic Games for the 2012 Summer Paralympics also held in London.[33]

In December 1952, the bridge opened while a number 78 double-decker bus (stock number RT 793, registration plate JXC 156) was crossing from the south bank. At that time, the gateman would ring a warning bell and close the gates when the bridge was clear before the watchman ordered the lift. The process failed while a relief watchman was on duty. The bus was near the edge of the south bascule when it started to rise; driver Albert Gunton made a split-second decision to accelerate, clearing a 3 ft gap to drop 6 ft onto the north bascule, which had not yet started to rise. There were no serious injuries.[34][35] Gunton was given 10 pounds by the City Corporation to honour his act of bravery.[36]
The Hawker Hunter Tower Bridge incident occurred on 5 April 1968 when a Royal Air Force Hawker Hunter FGA.9 jet fighter from No. 1 Squadron, flown by Flt Lt Alan Pollock, flew through Tower Bridge. Unimpressed that senior staff were not going to celebrate the RAF's 50th birthday with a fly-past, Pollock decided to do something himself. Without authorisation, Pollock flew the Hunter at low altitude down the Thames, past the Houses of Parliament, and continued on toward Tower Bridge. He flew the Hunter beneath the bridge's walkway, remarking afterwards that it was an afterthought when he saw the bridge looming ahead of him. Pollock was placed under arrest upon landing, and discharged from the RAF on medical grounds without the chance to defend himself at a court martial.[37][38]
In summer 1973 a single-engined Beagle Pup was twice flown under the pedestrian walkway of Tower Bridge by 29-year-old stockbroker's clerk Paul Martin. Martin was on bail following accusations of stockmarket fraud. He then 'buzzed' buildings in The City, before flying north towards the Lake District where he died when his aircraft crashed some two hours later.[39]
In May 1997,[40] the motorcade of United States President Bill Clinton was divided by the opening of the bridge. The Thames sailing barge Gladys, on her way to a gathering at St Katharine Docks, arrived on schedule and the bridge was duly opened for her. Returning from a Thames-side lunch at Le Pont de la Tour restaurant, with British Prime Minister Tony Blair, President Clinton was less punctual, and arrived just as the bridge was rising. The bridge opening split the motorcade in two, much to the consternation of security staff. A spokesman for Tower Bridge is quoted as saying, "We tried to contact the American Embassy, but they wouldn't answer the phone."[41]
On 19 August 1999, Jef Smith, a Freeman of the City of London, drove a flock of two sheep across the bridge. He was exercising a claimed ancient permission, granted as a right to Freemen, to make a point about the powers of older citizens and the way in which their rights were being eroded.[42]
Before dawn on 31 October 2003, David Crick, a Fathers 4 Justice campaigner, climbed a 100 ft (30 m) tower crane near Tower Bridge at the start of a six-day protest dressed as Spider-Man.[43] Fearing for his safety, and that of motorists should he fall, police cordoned off the area, closing the bridge and surrounding roads and causing widespread traffic congestion across the City and east London. At the time, the building contractor Taylor Woodrow Construction Ltd. was in the midst of constructing a new office tower known as 'K2'. The Metropolitan Police was later criticised for maintaining the closure for five days when this was not strictly necessary in the eyes of some citizens.[44][45]
On 11 May 2009, six people were trapped and injured after a lift fell 10 ft (3 m) inside the north tower.[46][47]

            <Title>Scene 7</Title>
            <Text>The door closed behind Monday, leaving Jonathan with a sense of being trapped. He was alone, in the dark, with Lord Connor’s body. He hovered at the door for a moment. He nearly considered following Monday out of the room, but he quickly realized that wasn’t an option.
This wasn’t the first time Jonathan’s impulsiveness had gotten him into a sticky situation. He didn’t know what he would have done if Connor had been alive when he’d stormed into the room. He hadn’t thought that far ahead.
He felt sick to his stomach as he thought of how it would look when Connor’s body was found, even if he managed to flee the room unseen. As he’d pointed out, he’d made no secret of the fact that he was looking for Connor. Lucy Marshall had likely seen him heading upstairs in pursuit of Connor. As soon as the police questioned her, they’d learn Jonathan’s name. 
He looked at the body on the floor. He needed to get rid of it. That was the only answer he could think of. It would be heavy, difficult to move on his own. Managing to get the body into the airship would require the ship to pull up so close to the window that it would be scraping the side of the house. As Mr. Monday had pointed out, that would be sure to draw attention. Which was exactly the sort of thing he needed to avoid.
He cursed Monday for leaving him here to deal with this on his own. There were no good options, but he had little choice but to deal with Monday’s mess.
He was beginning to think that things couldn’t possibly get any worse, when a knock came at the door.
“Lord Connor?” said a voice from outside.
With a sickening sense of dread, he thought of who might be on the other side of that door. One of Lord Connor’s servants? One of his guests? Or, he thought with a deepening sense of panic, was it the police? It was possible that someone else heard the gunshot and thought to summon policemen to investigate.
His lack of good options had narrowed even further. He desperately scanned the room for some place to put the body, feeling like a cornered animal.
Under the desk? A closet? Anywhere, really, so long as they didn’t see Lord Connor’s body lying face up on the floor the moment they walked in. No options presented themselves. The body was too large, and the room didn’t even have a broom closet.
“Just a moment,” he said in his best imitation of Connor’s voice. He wasn’t sure if it was convincing, but if it was, he might have just bought himself some time.
Quickly, but with an effort to be stealthy, he grabbed Connor’s chair and lodged it under the doorknob, jamming the door firmly. There wasn’t a proper lock on the door. The chair might not hold long, but it was the best he could do, given the circumstances.
“Sir, your guests are expecting you,” said the voice.
“Yes,” he called again. “Just give me a moment.”
After a moment, he heard muffled voices, conversing, arguing. Then the latch began to jiggle. They were trying the door. They must not have been convinced by his impression.
Bang.
The chair rattled. It held, but they began to bang on the door with more force. They would find their way in, sooner than later, and Jonathan would be caught in the room.
"Shit, shit, shit," he said under his breath.
There was no hiding the body at this point. There were only two ways out of the room. The first was through the hallway, where Connor’s servants were banging relentlessly on the door. The other option wasn’t that much better. But on the off-chance that he hadn’t been seen heading up to Connor’s office or on the chance that the police failed to question Lucy Marshall, it would at least be better than being caught in the room with Connor’s body.
He headed for the window, the chair continuing to rattle.
“Captain!” he began shouting. The chair jostled more furiously, and the wood began to splinter.
“Captain!” he shouted again, more urgently.
He felt a sense of panic as he looked out at the airship. He was trapped in this room, the airship his only hope for escape. If he could hail its captain. Otherwise, the ship was still too far to reach from here. His panic worsened the longer the ship continued to float there, unmoving. Every time the chair rattled, his nerves rattled with it.
He looked down at Connor’s corpse and thought dismally of how he might fare in Newgate Prison if the chair failed to hold. He tried not to think of what he might wear for his date with the gallows rope.
At last, the ship’s captain emerged onto its deck.
“What is it, sir?” said Captain Merrick, whose disheveled hair and lethargic movements suggested that he’d been catching some sleep. “I wasn’t expecting you so soon.”
“Never mind that! The ship!” Jonathan called, still in a bit of a panic. “I need you to bring it closer.”
“Closer?” the captain repeated.
“Right up against the house,” Jonathan explained.
He chewed his lip as he waited, a nervous habit of his that tended to leave his lips a bit chapped. He gestured frantically for the captain to hurry it up. Any moment now the door would cave in beneath the efforts of Lord Connor’s servants and whoever else might be assisting them. Perhaps, he thought again, even the police had been summoned.
The captain issued a message to his crew, speaking into a little tube that conveyed his voice into the cabin. A moment later, they were taking in the lines that held the airship tethered to a nearby tree.
The ship at last cast off, but it was already too late. With a violent splintering of wood, the door crashed open. The chair toppled to the floor. Jonathan saw that the latch had been broken. Three men were fighting their way through the doorway.
To his surprise and horror, they were not servants at all, neither were they policemen. They wore the black, bird-like leather masks of plague doctors. Like Solomon Grundy, the man he'd met on his way into the masquerade. Suddenly, something clicked inside his mind. These men were Resurrectionists.
The first of them, masked like the others and wearing a red cloak, had set his eyes on the spots of blood on the carpet. The bullet hole. The body.
Jonathan turned away for just a second, looking out at the airship. Still too far to reach, but there was nothing for it but to jump. He pushed the window open a bit further, and climbed up onto the windowsill.
“Stop!” cried one of the plague doctors, his voice muffled through the leather of the mask. Jonathan recognized him by his top hat. It was Solomon Grundy. “He’s going to jump. Stop him!”
Jonathan realized the Resurrectionists hadn’t seen the airship. They thought he was going to jump to his death. He waited, trying to bide his time and let the airship draw closer. He wobbled on the windowsill, but the Resurrectionists had halted, wary of startling Jonathan and causing him to jump. At least, he thought, this meant they wanted him alive. Probably so they could question him and kill him later, but still. It was nice to know they didn’t want him immediately dead.
He didn’t dare look out the window to check on the Penny Dreadful’s progress, for fear of giving away his escape plan. Worst case scenario, should he fail to make the jump, he was only on the second floor. He’d land on the grass below, suffer a broken arm or leg, and be apprehended and arrested for murder, tortured and killed discretely by the Resurrectionists, or he might hit a propeller on the way down and meet his swift end to the spinning blade. So, no pressure.
Best to wait until the last possible moment. The ship was quick despite its size, but the Resurrectionists were quicker and had less distance to travel.
“Just come down from there,” said Grundy, his voice so muffled by the mask Jonathan could barely understand him. “We just want to ask you some questions.”
“Don’t come any closer, Mr. Grundy,” Jonathan warned. “I’ll jump.”
“Let’s just shoot him and get it over with,” said the plague doctor with the red cloak.
Jonathan drew his own gun and pointed it at them. His hand was trembling from nerves, and he was wobbling precariously on the ledge of the window. This caused them to hesitate. Nothing was more dangerous than a frightened man with a loaded gun.
Jonathan tried to listen for the airship. As its engines grew louder, he judged that it might now be close enough to make the leap. Suddenly one of the Resurrectionists cried out and lunged towards him; he must have seen the airship behind Jonathan and realized his plan. He’d tried to hide the airship with his body, but there was nothing for it now but to jump.
He turned and leapt. He could practically feel Grundy's hand reach for him and miss. For a moment, he was airborne. Then, he was grasping for the railing. He struck the side of the gondola, hard. He felt the breath knocked out of him. His pistol slipped out of his hand and hit the ground below, but he managed to hold on.
One of the crewmen hurried over to help Jonathan scramble over the railing and swing himself up onto the ship’s deck.
“Get us away from the house, Captain,” said Jonathan, still struggling for breath.
Already, Grundy was looking like he was considering making the jump himself, and the ship’s momentum was propelling it, still further towards the house. The jump would be easier to make now. Grundy began to climb onto the window ledge.
The captain took his hand from the steering wheel, drew his pistol and aimed it at the window.
“Don’t even think about boarding my ship,” he warned. “I’ll shoot you dead the moment you step aboard.”
Grundy hesitated, looking back at Connor’s body. Jonathan could hear the voices of the other plague doctors, though he couldn’t make out what they were saying. At last, Grundy backed down, growling in frustration.
“Let’s go, Captain. Party’s over,” said Jonathan, wheezing.
“Yes, sir,” said Merrick. Then into the speaking tube, he directed his crew. “Take ‘er away, lads.”</Text>
            <Comments>When Johnathan had to repeat his call to this Captain, did he feel a sense of urgency, panic? Trapped?
You indicate that he was waiting impatiently. Maybe indicate some action, like he gestured for the captain to speed up (i doubt he would see Jonathan) or maybe he was tapping his foot? If he doesn’t have a visual tell, maybe he is mentally counting the seconds and the stress is building? 
Additional list of suggestions if you want him to have a physical tell; twitch your finger, fiddle with an article of clothing or body part, fidget, squirm (sometimes considered fidgeting), speak incessantly, cough, hyperventilate, freak out

Different word here (originally unlashing).
unleashing? untying?

I was looking this up the other week! Airships are generally docked at a mast but anchored would be suitable as would tied off. (Sounds like knitting I know, but both are sailing terms too - I’m dredging my murky memories of messing about in boats.) Moored would work too.
- Lady Naomi

Modern airships moor to a mast by the nose of the gasbag, because that’s how the century+ of technology has developed. If you’re back a hundred-plus years, you can create whatever technology pegs your fun meter.  Just be consistent.  Kestrel moors her hull or gondola to the docks provided at the aerodromes, just as modern ships moor to piers.  A boat or small craft would “tie up;” a larger vessel “moors.”  Both of them “cast off” to get underway.  On anchoring, Kestrel carries and uses an anchor in the form of a large grappling hook which they tow to snag on something, but that’s only where there are no dock facilities, and that isn’t the way they work on ocean vessels.  The principle is similar, though.
   Looking at your sentence below, you might try a variation on “The captain issued orders to his crew, and a moment later they were taking in the line that had held them tethered to a nearby tree.”
   Oh, if you’re using nautical terminology, which is logical if you’re in the early days, as there is no standing body of aviation jargon, then fiber ropes are called “lines” up to about 5” in circumference, after which they are called “hawsers.”  Wires can be called “wire ropes” or “cables” pretty much interchangeably.  You might Google “nautical terms,” and Favorite a pretty complete glossary.  That could serve you well if you’re going deep into this.

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>Somehow during the telling of Ms. Monday’s story, they’d managed to polish off the entire bottle of wine. Still, after hearing it, Mr. O felt entirely sober.
The time of Mrs. Grimmer’s appointment was imminent, but he was hardly paying attention to the clock.
“So, what did happen to Papa Doc?” he asked.
Miss Monday drank the last sip of her glass of wine. “I suppose we’ll never know.”
“Well, knowing you, I’d say there’s a very good chance you completed your mission,” said Mr. O.
“Maybe,” she replied with a smirk. Yes, even in her state of shock, there was still very little doubt that she’d seen her mission through to completion. She couldn’t say for certain, but she did know that Papa Doc hadn’t been heard from since.
He stood up. He nearly turned back to his alcohol cupboard, but instead he picked up a pen from his desk. He twirled it through his fingers, just to keep his hands busy.
“So, you knew? All this time, you knew about the unliving. Zombies, you called them, but they are clearly one and the same. Lord Connor was not the first one you faced.”
Miss Monday shook her head.
“No, he was not the first,” she said. “But I never believed in them. I knew they were not healthy, nor sound of mind. I knew they were dangerous. But I always believed they were human.”
“Hence your guilty conscience,” Mr. O surmised.
“Well, yes, I suppose I did feel a bit guilty,” she admitted. “I mean, who wouldn’t? Who knows how many I slaughtered in that barn? And some of them women and children to boot. But honestly, I didn’t feel all that guilty, really. Sometimes I did, sure. But mostly, I felt angry. The world had taken something from me. And I felt I was owed something in return.”
“The world takes something from all of us,” said Mr. O. “Is there any man who hasn’t felt that?”
“What did the world take from you?” Miss Monday asked.
“My father.”
 He reached for another sip of wine before he remembered it was all gone. Instead, he reached into his drawer and extracted a package of cigarettes.
“Do you mind?” he asked.
Miss Monday shook her head, so he lit himself a cigarette and sucked on it. He exhaled a puff of smoke.
“So that’s why you got so irate when I told you that part of my job is to keep the unliving a secret,” he said.
Miss Monday nodded. “If I’d been better prepared when I walked into that barn…” she said and trailed off. “Do you really think Dr. Tidkins could be involved with whoever hired me?”
Mr. O took another drag on his cigarette and exhaled slowly. “I’d say there’s a very good chance that Dr. Tidkins is the man who hired you, wouldn’t you?”
Miss Monday sat bolt upright at that.
“Well, consider first Dr. Tidkins' rare knowledge of theLazarus Virus, in addition to the fact that he is familiar with you and your work, and the fact that you have not met your client face to face, nor have you seen Dr. Tidkins' face. And of course there is the unsettling way in which the unliving men have been surgically enhanced by devices not unlike your own prosthetic eye and arm. I’d say Dr. Tidkins is our chief suspect.”
“Or rather our only suspect,” said Miss Monday.
“Yes, there is that,” said Mr. O. “Of course, if it was indeed Dr. Tidkins, I may have to amend my initial assessment. Dr. Tidkins would not have tried to kill you using a zombie to do the job. He would have known you would easily survive the attack. But he might have tried to use Lord Connor to kill me.”
“But why would he want to kill you?”
Mr. O paused to think, but it only took him a moment. “I mentioned this theory before,” he began. “As I’ve been saying, anyone who knows about the unliving may be in danger. Lord Connor has already been eliminated. Some of my other Agents…well, let’s just say they’ve not all returned from their missions. And then there are the several attempts on our lives.”
“Not very good ones,” she replied.
“Yes, well. You’re more difficult to kill than you look, aren’t you?” he said, smoking his cigarette with obvious relish. He puffed out a few rings of smoke. “As am I. Though I imagine the next attempt on our lives will not be so half-hearted as the last. Something big is coming. I can feel it. I have fewer Agents than ever before, and the dead are rising in greater and greater numbers, equipped with weapons the likes of which we have never seen. The Society of Immortals is planning something, I don’t know what, but I can’t imagine it doing any good. We must be prepared for any eventuality, Miss Monday.”
She offered up an indifferent shrug of her shoulders. “I’m always prepared.”
“There’s one more thing,” he began. Just then, there was a knock on the door. He sighed. “I suppose it will have to wait.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>Mrs. Grimmer had a knack for annoyingly flawless punctuality. The knock that came at the door coincided perfectly with the chime of the clock.   A moment later, the door creaked open. Mrs. Hallward peaked her head in.
“Mrs. Grimmer is here to see you.”
After a smile and a nod by way of response from Mr. O, Mrs. Hallward returned her attention to the Financier.
“Mr. O will see you now.”
The door swung open to its full extent and revealed the familiar, yet imposing figure of Mrs. Grimmer. Grandness of stature was obviously a family trait; Mrs. Grimmer could in no way at all possible be considered small, especially for a lady. Even compared to her son, she seemed a bit of a giant.
The swish of fabric and the jangle of jewelry as Mrs. Grimmer shuffled into the room, her excessively large bustle just barely squeezing through the narrow threshold of the door, drowned out all other sound.
“Miss Monday,” she said politely with a nod.
Miss Monday nodded politely back.
“Miss Monday, if it’s not too much of an inconvenience, I wonder if I could trouble you to take our friend—” Mr. O gestured at the black duffle bag that lay on the floor, its unpleasant odour still filling the room, “To the quartermaster’s office. You’ll find it just to the right of the first laboratory, down the hall. Mrs. Hallward will be happy to assist you, should you have any trouble.”
“I suppose I could manage that,” said Miss Monday, standing up. She grabbed the bag, and rather than picking it up, began to drag it across the floor.
“I cannot thank you enough,” said Mr. O.
She dragged the body bag out of the room, closing the door on her way out, probably relieved not to have to sit in on the meeting.
Once Miss Monday was gone from the room, Mrs. Grimmer took a seat in front of Mr. O’s desk, and folded her hands on top of her lap.
“I have decided to continue funding the Agency,” she announced.
“Oh, thank God,” Mr. O said, letting out a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding.
“I’m not quite sure what He has to do with it,” said Mrs. Grimmer, “You ought to be thanking the Queen.”
“The Queen of England?” Mr. O asked, surprised.
“No, the Queen of Sheba,” Mrs. Grimmer snapped, “Yes, the Queen of England. I was recently invited to tea with Her Majesty, during which occasion she impressed upon me the importance of this organisation and its continued secrecy. If, as has been proposed, the Agency’s funding were to be taken over by the Crown, it would necessarily become public knowledge, in which case its mission would be compromised.”
“Indeed,” said Mr. O, “As I’ve said before, the Lazarus Virus must not become public knowledge, lest it fall into the wrong hands and become weaponized. Imagine: a weapon like that in the hands of the enemies of England. Speaking of which, I have reason to believe—”
Mrs. Grimmer shrugged as she cut him off mid-sentence. “Quite honestly, I could care less about any of that. I do wish to remain in favour with Our Majesty, however, so the funding is yours. On one condition, that is.”
There was always a catch. “Let’s hear it,” he said.
She pushed an envelope across his desk.
“What’s this?” he asked. His words came out as a complaint.
“It’s an envelope,” she replied.
Mr. O held back a sigh. He breathed deeply in an attempt to keep his mounting frustration at bay. “Yes, mother,” he said, “I can see that it’s an envelope. My question pertained more to the point of the contents therein.”
He retrieved a letter opener from the top drawer of his desk, slit the envelope, and extracted a folded sheet of paper. He skimmed through the contents of the letter, his face creasing expressively as he read. Once he’d read it through, he looked up and met his mother’s eyes. Then he read through it once again in its entirety.
Mrs. Grimmer sat patiently while he read, and when he was finished, he nodded, stood up, and followed his mother out of the room.</Text>

St. James's Park is bounded by Buckingham Palace to the west, The Mall and St. James's Palace to the North, Horse Guards to the east, and Birdcage Walk to the south.
The park has a small lake, St. James's Park Lake, with two islands, West Island, and Duck Island, which is named for the lake's collection of waterfowl. This includes a resident colony of pelicans, which has been a feature of the park since the first gift of the birds from a Russian ambassador in 1664. The Blue Bridge across the lake affords a view west towards Buckingham Palace framed by trees. Looking east the view includes the Swire fountain to the north of Duck Island and, past the lake, the grounds known as the Horse Guards Parade, with the Horse Guards building, the Old War Office building and Whitehall Court progressively behind. To the south of Duck Island is the Tiffany fountain situated on Pelican Rock and past the lake is the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, with the London Eye, the Shell Tower and The Shard progressively behind.
The park is the most easterly of a near-continuous chain of parks that also comprise (moving westward) Green Park, Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. The closest London Underground stations are St. James's Park, Victoria, and Westminster.

In 1532, Henry VIII purchased from Eton College an area of marshland, through which the Tyburn flowed. This land lay to the West of York Place, recently acquired by Henry from Cardinal Wolsey; it was purchased in order to turn York Palace, renamed Whitehall, into a dwelling fit for a king. On James I's accession to the throne in 1603, he ordered that the park be drained and landscaped, and kept exotic animals in the park, including camels, crocodiles, and an elephant, as well as aviaries of exotic birds along the south.
During Charles II's exile in France under the Commonwealth of England, the young king was impressed by the elaborate gardens at French royal palaces, and on his ascension had the park redesigned in a more formal style, probably by the French landscaper André Mollet. This included the creation of the 775 by 38 metre (850 by 42 yard) canal visible in the old plan. Charles II opened the park to the public, as well as using the area to entertain guests and mistresses, such as Nell Gwyn. The park was notorious at the time as a meeting place for acts of degeneracy, of which John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester wrote in his poem A Ramble in St. James's Park.
In the late 17th and early 18th century cows were grazed on the park, and milk could be bought fresh at the "Lactarian", described by Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach in 1710.[3]
The 18th century saw further changes, including the reclamation of part of the canal for Horse Guards Parade and the 1761 purchase of Buckingham House (now Buckingham Palace) at the west end of the Mall, for the use of Queen Charlotte.
Further remodelling in 1826–27, commissioned by the Prince Regent (later George IV) and overseen by the architect and landscaper John Nash, saw the straight canal's conversion to a more naturally-shaped lake, and formal avenues rerouted to romantic winding pathways. At the same time, Buckingham House was expanded to create the current palace and Marble Arch was built at its entrance, whilst The Mall was turned into a grand processional route, opened to public traffic 60 years later in 1887, the Marble Arch having been moved to its current location at the junction of Oxford Street and Park Lane in 1851 and replaced with the Victoria Memorial between 1906 and 1924.

André Mollet's design for the park in Charles II's time, before 18th and 19th century remodelling, which shaped a more natural-looking lake from the straight canal visible here, the eastern part of which was filled in to create Horse Guards Parade.

            <Text>Miss Monday stood with her back to the door. She could hear the muffled voices of Mrs. Grimmer and Mr. O from within, but she couldn’t make out what they were saying. The door was too thick.
Finally, she looked up at Mrs. Hallward—or Miss Thompson. Had her life always been so strange? These days it seemed that every name she knew was pseudonym.
“Miss Thompson,” she said.
“Miss Gray,” her neighbour replied.
They simply stared at one another for a while. It was strange, seeing her in this light. She had grown so accustomed to that other version of her, that pretty, friendly lady of the night, with whom she’d so often stopped on her way out the door to gossip and chat about mundane things like the weather, gentlemen, and social gatherings. And now, she had to wonder if that had all been a lie.
“So, you work for Mr. O?” she said.
Mrs. Hallward looked at her helplessly.
“Is that how he knew where to find me?” Miss Monday asked. “Were you even my neighbour?” she wondered, “Or were you simply planted there to keep an eye on me? How long has the Agency been tracking me?”
“No, no, that isn’t it at all,” Mrs. Hallward insisted, “I truly was your neighbour. When Mr. O came looking for you, he knocked first at my door. I was quite surprised to see him, and he was likewise surprised to see me. It was coincidence, nothing else.”
“Coincidence,” Miss Monday snorted. “So, I take it you’re not really a prostitute?”
“No,” she replied. “Not really.”
“So which is your real name? Thompson or Hallward?”
“Thompson,” she said, “But I’ll thank you to call me Mrs. Hallward so long as we’re at the Agency.”
“I can manage that,” Miss Monday grumbled.
She wasn’t sure why she was angry, or why she was taking it out on Mrs. Hallward. Maybe she was just tired of all the secrets. All the false identities. All the lies. The conspiracies. The spying. The plotting. In her world of secrets and lies, Miss Thompson had seemed so straight forward, so mundane. And now, even she was not as straight forward as she’d seemed. Then again, perhaps she was just angry that she’d been fooled by Miss Thompson's secret identity.

Fleet Street is a street in the City of London named after the River Fleet, London's largest underground river. It was the home of British national newspapers until the 1980s. Even though the last major British news office, Reuters, left in 2005, the term Fleet Street continues to be used as a metonym for the British national press.

Fleet Street in c. 1890.
As early as the 13th century, it seems to have been known as Fleet Bridge Street, and in the early part of the 14th century it began to be mentioned frequently by its present name, spelled in accordance with the customs of those days.[1] Fleet Street began as the road from the commercial City of London to the political hub of Westminster. The length of Fleet Street marks the expansion of the City in the 14th century. At the east end of the street is where the River Fleet flowed against the medieval walls of London; at the west end is the Temple Bar which marks the current City of London/City of Westminster boundary, extended there in 1329. At Temple Bar to the west, as Fleet Street crosses the boundary out of the City of London, it becomes the Strand; to the east, past Ludgate Circus, the route rises as Ludgate Hill.
The A4 road historically began at Ludgate Circus and the whole of Fleet Street was part of the route. However the A4 today begins at Holborn Circus, runs down Fetter Lane and then the western part of Fleet Street. It then continues west into Westminster.
The street numbering runs consecutively from west to east south-side and then east to west north-side.
The nearest London Underground stations are Temple, Chancery Lane, and Blackfriars tube/mainline station, and the City Thameslink railway station.

In the high middle ages seniior ecclesiastics had their London palaces in the street, place-names surviving with this connection are Peterborough Court and Salisbury Court after their respective Bishops' houses here; apart from the Knights Templars' establishment the Whitefriars monastery is recalled by Whitefriars Street and the remains of its undercroft have been preserved in a public display area.
Today three churches serve the spiritual needs of the three 'communities' associated with the area of the street: Temple Church for the Bar, St Bride's Church, remains the London church most associated with the print industry. St Dunstan's in the West supplements these as the local parish (as opposed to guild church) and is the London home for the Romanian Orthodox church.

To the south lies an area of legal buildings known as the Temple, formerly the property of the Knights Templar, which at its core includes two of the four Inns of Court: the Inner Temple and the Middle Temple. There are many lawyers' offices (especially barristers' chambers) in the vicinity. At the junction with Strand, are the Royal Courts of Justice and the Central Criminal Court on Old Bailey is also only a few minutes walk from Ludgate Circus.


Fleet Street pictured in 1953, with flags hung for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.

As a principal route leading to and from the City, Fleet Street was especially noted for its taverns and coffeehouses. Many notable persons of literary and political fame used to frequent these, and a few, such as Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese, have survived to this day, in name at least.

Many famous men are associated with Fleet Street, either by living there or in one of its many side streets, or by being regular frequenters of its taverns. Amongst these include Ben Jonson, John Milton, Izaak Walton, John Dryden, Samuel Johnson who both lived and compiled his Dictionary in the coincidentally named Johnson Court, Edmund Burke, Oliver Goldsmith and Charles Lamb.[1] John Senex owned a map store on Fleet Street.[2] Wynkyn de Worde was buried in St. Bride's in 1535. In 1633, the church saw Samuel Pepys baptised, there is a small museum display about him in Prince Henry's Room the gatehouse of the Inner Temple.
From 1690 the Royal Society was based in Crane Court.

The eastern part of the street was destroyed by the Great Fire of London in 1666 which ended near Fetter Lane and the special tribunal of the 'Fire Courts' was held at Clifford's Inn to arbitrate on claimant's rights following this.



Fleet Street in 2008.
Fleet Street is now more associated with the investment banking, legal and accountancy professions. The Inns of Court and barristers' chambers, many of which are down alleys and around courtyards off Fleet Street itself. Many of the old newspaper offices are now their London headquarters; eg Goldman Sachs is in the old Daily Telegraph and Liverpool Echo buildings of Peterborough Court and Mersey House. C. Hoare &amp; Co, England's oldest privately owned bank, has had its place of business here since 1690. Child &amp; Co, at 1 Fleet Street, now a wholey owned subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland claims to be the oldest continuous banking establishment as founded in 1580.
An informal measure of City takeover business employed by financial editors is the number of taxis waiting outside such law firms as Freshfields at 11pm: a long line is held to suggest a large number of mergers and acquisitions in progress.[3]

Publishing started in Fleet Street around 1500 when William Caxton's apprentice, Wynkyn de Worde, set up a printing shop near Shoe Lane, while at around the same time Richard Pynson set up as publisher and printer next to St. Dunstan's church. More printers and publishers followed, mainly supplying the legal trade in the four Law Inns around the area. In March 1702, London's first daily newspaper, the Daily Courant, was published in Fleet Street from premises above the White Hart Inn.
Almost all of the newspapers thereabouts have moved east to Wapping, Canary Wharf and south to Southwark in the 1980s and 1990s. The former offices of The Daily Telegraph, The Daily Express and the Reuters organisation are Listed Buildings in both exteriors and parts of interiors.
The London office of D.C. Thomson &amp; Co., creator of The Beano, is still based on Fleet Street. The Secretariat of the Commonwealth Broadcasting Association is also based at number 17. Since 1995 Fleet Street has been the home of Wentworth Publishing, an independent publisher of newsletters and courses. In 2006 the Press Gazette returned to Fleet Street, albeit only briefly. The Associated Press and The Jewish Chronicle remain close by. The Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph have recently returned to the centre of London after having been downriver in Canary Wharf, but have not returned to Fleet Street.
In the adjacent St. Brides Lane is the St Bride Library, holding a specialist collection relating to the type and print industry.
Several other news or publishing-related organisations are clustered on or close to Fleet Street. The British Association of Journalists is based at 89 Fleet Street; the Newspaper Society is nearby on St. Andrew Street; KM Group is at 75 Shoe Lane; and at number 76 is the London International Press Centre, home to TradeWinds, the international shipping news magazine, the Cartoonists' Club, and the International Broadcasting Convention. Metro International, publishers of the free newspaper Metro, are at 85 Fleet Street, while Meteor Press is at number 17.
Other press and publishing related businesses and institutions in and around Fleet Street include The Wall Street Journal in Fleet Place, the New Law Journal, the Perseus Books Group, Bowker UK, Motor Cycle News, the Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers, and the London Press Club.
On the wall of Magpie Alley, off Bouverie Street, is a huge mural depicting the history of newspapers in the area.


The City's Dragon 'supporter' atop the present Temple Bar

From the eastern end of the street towards the west can be seen various statues and monuments. At the north-eastern corner is a bust of Edgar Wallace, and then at number 106 set in an ornate niche a full-length representation of Mary, Queen of Scots the building originated as the London office of a Scottish insurance company, she has no connection with the area. Above the entrance to the old school-house of St Dunstan's is a statue of Queen Elizabeth I taken from the old Ludgate which was demolished 1766. This statue dated of 1586 is considered to be the oldest outdoor statue in London, there are few other claims that are older.[citation needed] In the porch below are three statues of ancient Britons also from the gate, probably meant to represent King Lud and his two sons. Adjacent to Queen Elizabeth is a bust of Lord Northcliffe, the newspaper proprietor, co-founder of the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror. Next to Lord Northcliffe is a memorial tablet to James Louis Garvin, another pioneering British journalist.
On the southern side of the street nearby memorials and monuments include the Temple Bar; in Inner Temple Gardens is a memorial to Charles Lamb. In Salisbury Court there is an obelisk which originally stood at the south-eatern corner of the street at Ludgate Circus commemorating Alderman Weightman, a Georgian Radical leader of the City, sometime Lord Mayor and MP; it was set up here after many years in storage to commemorate the 800th Anniversary of the Lord Mayoralty in 1989. A short distance further on is a magnificent George and Dragon fountain. On the main street at the corner of Bouverie Street is a plaque commemorating the clockmaker Thomas Tompion and in that street another plaque indicating the birthplace of Samuel Pepys. At number 87 is a bust of TP O'Connor.

The barber Sweeney Todd, traditionally said to have lived and worked in Fleet Street (he is sometimes called the 'Demon Barber of Fleet Street'). An urban myth example of a serial killer, the character appears in various English language works starting in the mid-19th century. Neither the popular press, the Old Bailey trial records, the trade directories of the City nor the lists of the Barbers' Company mention any such person or indeed any such case.

            <Title>Scene 75</Title>
            <Text>Annabel Grey, better known as Miss Monday, crept along the hallway of the Resurrectionists’ underground headquarters in the basement of the printing company. Once a research facility for the monster hunters in Charles Grimmer’s employ, it was now a sanctuary for the Resurrectionists, monsters themselves. Annabel had to remind herself that not all of the scientists were willing accomplices to Anthony Tidkins’ plot. Those who betrayed him were, like Lord Henry Connor, dealt with mercilessly. The scientists were under Tidkins’ thumb. They had little choice but to do as he said. Still, if it came down to it, she wouldn’t hesitate to kill them. If it couldn’t be helped.
“This way.”
She turned to follow Abraham Palmer down a hallway she hadn’t been down before. It was impossible to guess the size of the facility, but it seemed labyrinthine, given the number of unexplored corridors, offices, and laboratories.
It was only due to Mr. Palmer’s hand-drawn map of the complex and his knowledge of its layout that they were able to find the Beta Laboratory. With a silent exchange of glances, she signaled that she was ready and waited for Palmer’s confirmation. He slipped on his Resurrection mask, and nodded.   Annabel hid her crossbow behind her hip, out of view. She pushed open the door with her other hand.
The Beta Lab put its Alpha counterpart to shame, at least in size. It was a vast, open space that made Annabel forget how deep underground they were. A number of enormous machines took up space within the room, boilers at work, hissing steam, chemicals running through tubes. Several rows of operating tables spanned the room, tubes running from the machines to the bodies on the tables. Colorful liquid pumped into their veins, while they struggled against their bonds. Each body on each table was strapped down, wrists and ankles cuffed so tight the bonds cut into their skin. Not that they would feel it; they were zombies.
Despite the barbaric experiments that were conducted here, there was a clinical cleanliness to the room, a thorough organization to the madness. Annabel wondered if the men on the operating tables had been dead when the experiments had started, whether it was the disease or the cure the Resurrectionists were pumping into their veins. She knew they had no qualms about spreading the deadly disease.
A series of hazy black and white photographs were pinned to one of the walls. Unusual photographs, they revealed the subjects’ skeletons.
Another section of the laboratory seemed to be dedicated to the study of those corvine birds that had provided the emblem for the Resurrectionists. Tubes filled with blood were stored in a glass cabinet, kept cool by some mechanical device. Condensation had formed upon the glass.
A dozen dissected birds were mounted with labeled pins, while the living birds squawked in their cages as scientists pricked them with needles, either drawing blood or injecting the crows with something. It was part rookery, part slaughterhouse, part monster hospital.
For a minute, Annabel and Palmer went unobserved, which gave them ample time to take stock of the laboratory. Eventually, the scientists seemed to notice the presence of the intruders. Annabel made a quick count of the Resurrectionists. Eight of them. She had more than enough bullets, not to mention crossbow bolts.
She recognised one of them, despite the mask he wore. His posture, greying hair, and age-spotted skin gave him away. Lifting his mask with one hand, he coughed into a handkerchief, then took a puff of air from a device that was hooked up to a cylindrical tank. He lowered his mask, again covering his mouth. But Annabel was sure of who it was. Dr. Jekyll, the scientist she’d first encountered in the lab that housed the zombie in the fish-tank.
Annabel was surprised to see he hadn’t yet succumbed to the Lazarus Virus. He was clearly suffering from its effects, but the fact that he was still living suggested he had some sort of resistance. Perhaps the scientists were already close to finding a cure.
“What are you doing here?” he asked, staring at her confusion.
“How’s the head?” she asked.
Jekyll put a hand to his head where she’d hit him, but he said nothing.
Palmer quieted her with a look. She frowned, but let him take the lead.
“I have the subject in hand,” said Palmer, taking her in hand and nudging her forward. He used his own body to help her conceal her weapon.
This had been Annabel’s plan. If this had been an ordinary burglary, Annabel would have stole into the laboratory, avoiding direct confrontation, and taking the research right from under the Resurrectionists’ noses. But the facility was too heavily guarded, and the Resurrectionists were on the lookout for her. Better to treat this mission as a heist than as a burglary, to favor deception over stealthiness.
The Resurrectionists believed that Palmer was loyal to their cause. He might have jeopardized that by helping Annabel escape, but Annabel figured he could regain their trust by bringing her in as his captive. Then, once their guard was down, they would strike.
“She escaped from the holding cell,” said Palmer. “I managed to recapture her. I understand she was a subject of interest, given her exposure to the Lazarus Virus.”
“Good, very good. Get her strapped down. There’s an empty table, just there.”
Slowly, Palmer moved her forward, careful to angle himself so as to keep her weapon hidden from view, until he stood adjacent to Dr. Jekyll. Only then did Palmer let her go.
The moment he did, she caught Dr. Jekyll in a headlock, aiming her crossbow at his skull. He yelped in surprise, and some of the Resurrectionists drew their own weapons. Only two of them were armed. After all, these men were scientists. Not all of the Resurrectionists were fighters.
Annabel positioned herself so that they didn’t have a clean shot at her without risking killing Dr. Jekyll.
“Put your guns down,” she instructed.
“Do as she says,” said Palmer.
Slowly, careful not to make any sudden moves, the gentlemen complied.
“Good. Now, you’re going to collect whatever notes you have on the Lazarus Virus, and you’re going to hand them over to my friend here. Quickly, before I decide to introduce you to my other friend,” she said, brandishing the crossbow.
As instructed, the scientists began collecting pages of notes, gathering stacks of leather-bound notebooks. Years worth of research. It would take ages to sort through these notes, even with the best scientists working on it. They’d have to deal with that later. For now, she had other things to worry about.
She spoke quietly, directing her next words to Dr. Jekyll alone. “Where is Jack?”
He moved his head. She wasn’t sure if he was trying to answer her, or simply get free of her grasp. Eventually, she realized he was coughing, and she let him take a breath of air from his tank. Once he’d caught his breath, she pointed the crossbow at his neck.
“Who?”
“Anthony Tidkins,” she said. “Where will I find him?”
The doctor made another sound—at first Annabel thought he was coughing again, but then he unstrapped his mask, and pulled it from his face. He wasn’t coughing. He was laughing.
The mask had left deep lines on Jekyll’s face. He had dark bags beneath his eyes, and his skin was wrinkled and blemished. But it was not just age that marked his skin. In patches, his face was completely black, with lines of grey and violet radiating outward. His neck was peeling. Long strips of skin had fallen away. The flesh beneath the layers of dead skin was beginning to rot.
Annabel stared open-mouthed. Was this the result of injecting him with her infected blood? If she was actually immune, could she still have transmitted the virus? She remembered that he had been coughing, hacking up blood, even the first time she met him. This disease, if it was Lazarus, he’d had it before she injected her blood into him. He must have been taking some sort of medicine to stop the virus from spreading, but the virus was winning. No wonder he was so dedicated to the Resurrectionist cause, of finding a cure.
“Before you said Anthony Tidkins, you said Jack,” said Jekyll. “You knew him?”
“I did,” Annabel answered.
“And yet, you plan on killing him,” said the doctor. “Don’t try to deny it. I can see it in your eye. And your other eye. It looks like his handiwork. It is, isn’t it? You hold Jack responsible for what’s become of this city. For spreading the zombies. Perhaps he is responsible. Or perhaps I am, for teaching him. Jack Bernhardt was my apprentice, you know.”
“You’re Dr. Allen,” Annabel realized. Jack’s mentor. Jack had spoken of the doctor often. Just as Annabel had once thought of Jack as the brother she’d never had, Dr. Allen had been more of a father to Jack than his own father ever had.
The man she knew as Jekyll nodded. “I am,” he admitted.
Annabel kept her eyes on the other scientists, while her crossbow remained pointed at Jekyll. Threat lingered in her eyes, and they kept their wary distance. These were scientists, not soldiers. They seemed likely not to intervene so long as she retained the upper hand.
“Jack is our best hope of finding a cure,” said Jekyll. “He’s my best hope of a cure. So, you still think I’m going to tell you where to find him?”
“I’ll find him without your help,” Annabel said.
“Sorry. But I can’t let that happen.” Out of the corner of her eye, Annabel saw Abraham Palmer pointing a gun at her head.
“What are you doing?” she demanded.
“Put down the crossbow,” he said. “It’s over.”
She cursed under her breath. She’d known not to trust Palmer. And now, here was the proof. She should have trusted her instinct, not some man she barely knew.
She set the crossbow on the floor.</Text>

The night Lord Henry Connor was killed, I was hired to take something from his safe. According to Mrs. Grimmer, whatever it was, it was brought here.”


“I would tell you what it was that you stole, but I imagine the science will be beyond your comprehension,” he said.
“Humour me.”
“Very well. Are you at all familiar with the work of Nikola Tesla? I imagine not.”
“I am, as it happens. I was hired to relieve him of his experiments, on our mutual friend’s behalf,” she explained. “I made it look like his work had been lost in a fire, but the reality was that Jack had hired me to steal his research.”
“You continue to surprise me, Miss Monday,” said Dr. Jekyll, his voice still strained by her headlock. “Now, where was I? Ah, yes, Mr. Tesla had been experimenting with a technology that he called teleautomatics. Perhaps you heard about his demonstration of the technology. He used it to control a small boat, operating it with no wires, using a surprisingly small radio controller.”
“Go on,” Annabel told him.
“It was Lord Connor’s idea to use the technology to control the distribution of the Lazarus Virus. As we speak, there are mechanical crows being released at key points throughout the city. Trafalgar Square, Hyde Park, Borough Market, Westminster Palace. Each crow contains a vial of liquid laced with the Lazarus Virus. With the push of a single button on a single remote, the crows will release the gas. That’s what you stole, Miss Monday.”
Annabel’s felt the breath stolen from her lungs.
“You’re going to destroy the radio controller.”
“No,” he replied.
“Yes,” she insisted, pressing the pistol hard against his skull so he’d get the message.
He began to sob.
“No, no, no,” he said, tears staining the inside of his mask. “You don’t understand. You don’t understand.”
“Calm down,” she said. “I’m not going to shoot you, so long as you cooperate. What don’t I understand?”
“The radio controller…” he said, still sobbing, unable to finish his sentence.
Annabel almost felt sorry for him. After all, the man had been brainwashed by Jack’s serum. He might have been a good man, before that.
“What about it?”
“The radio controller…” Jekyll said again, looking at Annabel out of the corner of his eye. “It’s already been activated.”</Notes>

Trafalgar Square is a public space and tourist attraction in central London, United Kingdom, built around the area formerly known as Charing Cross. It is in the borough of the City of Westminster. At its centre is Nelson's Column, which is guarded by four lion statues at its base. There are a number of statues and sculptures in the square, with one plinth displaying changing pieces of contemporary art. The square is also used for political demonstrations and community gatherings, such as the celebration of New Year's Eve.
The name commemorates the Battle of Trafalgar (1805), a British naval victory of the Napoleonic Wars over France. The original name was to have been "King William the Fourth's Square", but George Ledwell Taylor suggested the name "Trafalgar Square".[1]
In the 1820s, George IV engaged the architect John Nash to redevelop the area. Nash cleared the square as part of his Charing Cross Improvement Scheme. The present architecture of the square is due to Sir Charles Barry and was completed in 1845.
Trafalgar Square is owned by the Queen in Right of the Crown, and managed by the Greater London Authority, while Westminster City Council owns the roads around the square, including the pedestrianised area of the North Terrace.[2]

Trafalgar Square, 1908
The square consists of a large central area with roadways on three sides, and a terrace to the north, in front of the National Gallery. The roads around the square form part of the A4 road.The square was formerly surrounded by a one-way traffic system, but works completed in 2003 reduced the width of the roads and closed the northern side to traffic.[3]
Nelson's Column is in the centre of the square, flanked by fountains designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens in 1937-9 as replacements for two earlier fountains of Peterhead granite (now in Canada), and guarded by four monumental bronze lions sculpted by Sir Edwin Landseer. The column is topped by a statue of Horatio Nelson, the vice admiral who commanded the British Fleet at Trafalgar.
On the north side of the square is the National Gallery and to its east St Martin-in-the-Fields church. The square adjoins The Mall entered through Admiralty Arch to the southwest. To the south is Whitehall, to the east Strand and South Africa House, to the north Charing Cross Road and on the west side Canada House.

From the time of Edward I to the early nineteenth century, most of the area now occupied by Trafalgar Square was the site of the King's Mews, which stretched north from the position of the original Charing Cross, where the Strand from the City met Whitehall, coming north from Westminster.
From 1732, the King's Mews were divided into the Great Mews and the smaller Green Mews to the north by the Crown Stables, a large block, built to the designs of William Kent. Its site is now occupied by the National Gallery. The Royal Mews were transferred to Pimlico in the 1820s, and the stable block used as a menagerie, and for the storage of public records, until its demolition in 1835.[4] In 1826 the Commissioners of H.M. Woods, Forests and Land Revenues instructed John Nash to draw up plans for clearing a large area south of Kent’s stable block, and as far east as St Martin’s Lane. His plans left open the whole area of what was to become Trafalgar Square, except for a block in the centre, which he reserved for a new building for the Royal Academy.[5] They also involved the demolition and redevelopment of an area of buildings between St Martin’s Lane and the Strand, and the construction of a road (now called Duncannon Street) across the churchyard of St Martin-in-the-Fields.[6] The Charing Cross Act was passed in 1826 and clearance of the ground started soon after.[5]
After the initial clearance, development of the square progressed slowly. The National Gallery was built on the north side in 1832-8 to a design by William Wilkins,[5] and in 1837 the Treasury approved Wilkins’ plan for the laying out of the square itself, but it was not put into effect.[7] In April 1840,[8] Wilkins having died in the meantime,[5] new plans by Charles Barry were accepted, and construction started within weeks.[8] For Barry, as for Wilkins, a major consideration was increasing the visual impact of the National Gallery, which had been widely criticised for its lack of grandeur. He dealt with the complex sloping site by excavating the main area of the square down to the level of the footway between Cockspur Street and the Strand,[9] and constructing a fifteen foot high balustraded terrace with a roadway on the north side, with steps at each end leading down to the main level.[8] Wilkins had proposed a similar solution, but with a central flight of steps.[7] Plinths were provided for sculpture and pedestals for lighting. All the stonework was of Aberdeen granite. The estimated budget, excluding paving and sculptures, was £11,000.[8] The earth removed was used to level Green Park.[9] The next year it was decided that two fountains should be included in the layout.[10] The square was originally paved with tarmacadam. This was replaced with stone in the 1920s.[11]
Nelson’s Column had been planned independently of Barry’s work. In 1838 a Nelson Memorial Committee had approached the government, proposing that a monument to the victor of Trafalgar, funded by public subscription, should be erected in the square, and the government had provisionally agreed. A competition was held, the winning design, by the architect William Railton, being for a Corinthian column topped by a statue of Nelson, with an overall height of more than 200 feet, guarded by four sculpted lions. The design was approved, with the proviso that the overall height should be reduced to 170 feet, and construction began in 1840.[8] The main construction of the column was completed, and the statue raised, in November 1843.[12] However, the last of bronze reliefs on the pedestal of the column was not installed until May 1854, and the four lions, although part of the original design, were only added in 1867.[13]
Barry was unhappy about Nelson’s column being placed in the square. In July 1840, when its foundations had already been laid, he told a parliamentary select committee "it would in my opinion be desirable that the area should be wholly free from all insulated objects of art".[8]
The hoardings were removed and the square opened to the public on 1 May 1844, although the asphalt paving was still soft, and the fountains were not playing. There was still a hoarding around the base of Nelson’s column, which was to remain for some years, and some of its upper scaffolding remained in place.[14]
The square has become a social and political focus for visitors and Londoners alike, developing over its history from "an esplanade peopled with figures of national heroes, into the country's foremost place politique", as historian Rodney Mace has written. Its symbolic importance was demonstrated in 1940 when the Nazi SS developed secret plans to transfer Nelson's Column to Berlin following an expected German invasion, as related by Norman Longmate in If Britain Had Fallen (1972).
Building work undertaken on the south side of the Square in 1960 revealed a number of deposits from the last interglacial. Among the findings, dating from approximately 40,000 years ago, were the remains of cave lion, rhinoceros, straight-tusked elephant and hippopotamus.[15]
A major redevelopment of the square led by WS Atkins with Foster and Partners as sub-consultants was completed in 2003. The work involved closing the main eastbound road along the north side, diverting the traffic around the other three sides of the square, demolishing the central section of the northern retaining wall and inserting a wide set of steps leading up to a pedestrianised terrace in front of the National Gallery. The construction includes two lifts for disabled access, public toilets, and a small café. Previously, access between the square and the Gallery was by two crossings at the northeast and northwest corners of the square.[16]



Sir Henry Havelock's statue
Barry's scheme provided two plinths for sculptures on the north side of the square.[17] A bronze equestrian statue of George IV by Sir Francis Chantrey, originally intended for the top of the Marble Arch,[5] was installed on the eastern one in 1844, while the other remained empty until the late twentieth century.[17] Two more statues on plinths were added during the nineteenth century; General Sir Charles James Napier by George Cannon Adams in the south-west corner of the square in 1855, and Major-General Sir Henry Havelock by William Behnes, in the south-east in 1861.[5] In 2000, the then Mayor of London Ken Livingstone controversially expressed a desire to see the two generals replaced with statues of people "ordinary Londoners would know".[18]
Main article: Fourth plinth, Trafalgar Square
Since 1998 the empty plinth in the north-west corner of the square - which has become known as the "Fourth Plinth" – has been used to show a series of specially commissioned artworks. The scheme was initiated by the Royal Society of Arts and continued by a Fourth Plinth Commission, appointed by the Mayor of London. A 1:30 scale replica of HMS Victory in a giant glass bottle by Yinka Shonibare was installed on the plinth in May 2010.[19][20]
There are three busts of admirals against the north wall of the square. Those of Lord Jellicoe by Sir Charles Wheeler and Lord Beatty by William MacMillan were installed in 1948 in conjunction with the square's two fountains, which also commemorate the two men.[21][22] A bust of the Second World War First Sea Lord Admiral Cunningham by Franta Belsky was unveiled alongside them on 2 April 1967.[23]
On the south side of the square, on the site of the original Charing Cross, is a bronze equestrian statue of Charles I by Hubert Le Sueur. It was cast in 1633, and placed in its present position in 1678.[24]
There are two statues on the lawn in front of the National Gallery: James II by Grinling Gibbons to the west of the portico, and George Washington, a replica of a work by Jean-Antoine Houdon, to the east.[25] The latter, was a gift from the state of Virginia installed in 1921.[26]
Two statues erected in the nineteenth century have since been removed. One, of Edward Jenner, the discoverer of vaccination, was set up in the south-west corner of the square in 1858, next to that of Napier. Sculpted by William Calder Marshall, it showed Jenner sitting in a chair in a relaxed pose, and was inaugurated at a ceremony presided over by Prince Albert. It was moved to Kensington Gardens in 1862.[27][28] The other, of General Charles George Gordon by Hamo Thornycroft, was erected on an eighteen-foot high pedestal between the two fountains in 1888. It was removed in 1943 and re-sited on the Victoria Embankment ten years later.[29]



The new LED lighting in the fountains
When the square was laid out in the 1840s, the fountains' primary purpose was not aesthetic, but rather to reduce the open space available and the risk of riotous assembly. They were originally fed by water pumped from an artesian well by a steam engine sited behind the National Gallery. In the late 1930s it was decided to replace the stone basins and the pump.The new fountains were built to a design by Sir Edwin Lutyens at a cost of almost £50,000. The old fountains were bought for presentation to the Canadian government, and are now in Ottawa and Regina.[30][31] The present fountains are memorials to Lord Jellicoe (western side) and Lord Beatty (eastern side).[5]
Further restoration work became necessary and was completed by May 2009. The pump system was replaced with a new pump capable of sending an 80-foot (24 m) jet of water into the air.[32] A new LED lighting system was also installed during this restoration to reduce the cost of lighting maintenance. The new lighting has been designed with the London 2012 Summer Olympics in mind and for the first time will project many different combinations of colours on to the fountains.[30] The new lighting system has a much lower energy requirement and will reduce its carbon footprint by around 90%.[32]



Pigeons flocking to London's Trafalgar Square, 2006. As of 2008 the pigeons had largely disappeared.


Falconer and trained Harris's Hawk in 2007
The square was once famous for its feral pigeons, and feeding them was a popular activity. The desirability of the birds' presence was contentious: their droppings disfigured stonework, and the flock, estimated at its peak to be 35,000, was considered a health hazard. In February 2001, the sale of bird seed in the square was stopped [33] and other measures introduced to discourage the pigeons, including the use of trained birds of prey.[34] Groups of supporters continued to feed the birds, but in 2003 the then-Mayor, Ken Livingstone, enacted bylaws to ban the feeding of pigeons in the square.[35] In September 2007 Westminster City Council passed further bylaws banning the feeding of birds on the square's pedestrianised North Terrace and other pavements in the area[36] There are now only six resident pigeons in Trafalgar Square[citation needed] and it is used for festivals and hired out to film companies in a way that was not feasible in the 1990s.



Trafalgar Square during the 2009-2010 New Year Celebrations
For many years, revellers celebrating the start of a New Year have gathered in the square, despite a lack of civic celebrations being arranged. The lack of official events in the square was partly because the authorities were concerned that actively encouraging more partygoers would cause overcrowding. Since 2005, a firework display centred on London Eye and the South Bank of the Thames has been provided as an alternative.
Victory in Europe Day (VE Day) was 8 May 1945, the date when the Allies during the Second World War celebrated the defeat of Nazi Germany. Trafalgar Square was filled with a crowd wanting to hear the formal announcement by Sir Winston Churchill that the war was over. The square was also used as a place of celebration by people travelling there from all over the country. On 8 May 2005 the BBC held a concert to celebrate the 60th anniversary of VE Day.


The Trafalgar Square Christmas tree on 23 December 2006
See also: Trafalgar Square Christmas tree
There has been a Christmas ceremony at Trafalgar Square every year since 1947. A Norway Spruce (or sometimes a fir) is given by Norway's capital Oslo and presented as London's Christmas tree, as a token of gratitude for Britain's support during World War II. (Besides the general war support, Norway's Prince Olav, as well as the country's government, lived in exile in London throughout the war.) As part of the tradition, the Lord Mayor of Westminster visits Oslo in the late autumn to take part in the felling of the tree, and the Mayor of Oslo then comes to London to light the tree at the Christmas ceremony.[37]
The lighting ceremony of a Christmas Tree is another reason why Trafalgar Square is London's most famous square. Switching on the lights of a giant Christmas tree has been a historical part of Christmas season in London since 1947.[38] The annual ceremony reminds people in London of the countdown to Christmas and is usually being held 12 days before December 25 each year. This festivity is open to the public and it gathers a large number of people who would like to see the lighting of one of Britain's most famous Christmas Trees.[39] This is usually accompanied with several nights of Christmas Carol singing programme, series of performances and events to entertain the crowd.[40] In 2012, its the 65th time that London has been presented with a Christmas tree from Oslo, Norway.[41] Performances during the ceremony included Norwegian trumpeter Tine Thing Helseth alongside the St. Martin-in-the-Fields choir and the Regend Hall Band of the Salvation Army.[42] According to the Norweigeian foresters, only the best tree was presented from their forest for the people of London. Fondly described by the woodsmen who care for it as 'the queen of the forest', it can reach up to 25 metres in height and is between 50 and 100 years old. The giant Christmas Tree is taken down on the 12th night of Christmas for recycling.[43]


A demonstration in Trafalgar Square


May Day in Trafalgar Square, 2008


Protesting against harassment of photographers under anti-terrorism law, 23 January 2010
Since its construction, Trafalgar Square has been a venue for political demonstrations, though the authorities have often attempted to ban them. The 1839 fountains were added on their current scale to reduce the possibility of crowds gathering in the square as they were not in the original plans.
By March of the year Nelson's column opened, the authorities had started banning Chartist meetings in the square. A general ban on political rallies remained in effect until the 1880s, when the emerging Labour movement, particularly the Social Democratic Federation, began holding protests there.
On "Black Monday" (8 February 1886), protesters rallied against unemployment; this led to a riot in Pall Mall. A larger riot (called "Bloody Sunday") occurred in the square on 13 November 1887.
One of the first significant demonstrations of the modern era was held in the square on 19 September 1961 by the Committee of 100, which included the philosopher Bertrand Russell. The protesters rallied for peace and against war and nuclear weapons.
Throughout the 1980s, a continuous anti-apartheid protest was held outside South Africa House. More recently, the square has hosted the Poll Tax Riots (1990) and anti-war demonstrations opposing the Afghanistan war and the Iraq war.[44]
The square was also scene to a large vigil held shortly after the terrorist bombings in London on Thursday, 7 July 2005.[45]
In December 2009, participants from the Camp for Climate Action occupied the square for the two weeks in which the UN Conference on Climate Change took place in Copenhagen.[46] It was billed as a UK base for direct action on climate change during the conference, and saw various actions and protests stem from the occupation.[47][48][49]
On 26 March 2011, the square was occupied by protesters using the square to protest against the UK Budget and its proposed budget cuts. During the night however, the situation turned violent as the escalation by riot police and protesters damaged portions of the square.[50]
On 21 June 2002, 12,000 people gathered in the square to watch the England national football team's World Cup quarter-final against Brazil on giant video screens which had been erected specially for the occasion.[51]
In the early 21st century, Trafalgar Square has become the location to the climax for sporting victory parades. It was used by the England national rugby union team on 9 December 2003 to celebrate their victory in the 2003 Rugby World Cup, and then on 13 September 2005 for the England national cricket team's victory in The Ashes.
On 6 July 2005 Trafalgar Square was a gathering place for the announcement on London's bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics, Located also on Trafalgar Square is its Official Countdown Clock unveiled on 14 March 2011.
In 2007, it hosted the opening ceremonies of the Tour de France.

As an archetypal London location, Trafalgar Square featured prominently in film and television productions during the Swinging London era of the late 1960s, including The Avengers, Casino Royale, Doctor Who, The Ipcress File and Man in a Suitcase. It was also used as a filming location for several sketches and a cartoon backdrop in the BBC comedy series Monty Python's Flying Circus.


Trafalgar Square temporarily grassed over in May 2007
In May 2007, the square was grassed over with 2,000 square metres of turf for two days as part of a campaign by London authorities to promote "green spaces" in the city.[53]
Every year on the anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar (21 October), the Sea Cadet Corps holds a parade in honour of Admiral Lord Nelson and the British victory over the combined fleets of Spain and France at Trafalgar. The Areas of the Sea Cadet Corps are represented by seven 24-cadet platoons. The National Sea Cadet Band also parades, as does a Guard and Colour Party.
On 7 July 2011, due to building works in Leicester Square, the world premiere of the final film in the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2, was held in Trafalgar Square, with a 0.75 mile red-carpet linking the two squares. Fans camped in Trafalgar Square for up to three days before the premiere. It was the first premiere ever to be held in Trafalgar Square.
Since 2006 the there have been annual celebrations of Canada Day (1 July), initiated by the Canadian community in the United Kingdom, endorsed by the Canadian High Commission, sponsored by Canadian companies, and organised by a private promotions company. The event features Canadian performers, Canadian food kiosks, and a street hockey tournament, among other activities.[54]

            <Title>Scene Three</Title>
            <Text>As the two women made their way along the hall, carrying the body of a dead prostitute in a bag, Miss Monday’s attention was stolen by the nameplates on the doors. She nearly dropped the body bag. Instead, she asked the other woman for a brief respite, and lowered the body to the floor.
Already beginning to work up a bit of a sweat, Miss Monday gestured to one of the plaques on the door.
“Abraham Palmer?” she read.
“Oh, you’ll meet him,” said Mrs. Hallward.
“Where is he now?”
“On patrol,” she replied. “Slaying the unliving,” she clarified.
Miss Monday nodded. She pointed at another door.
“Bartholomew White? Another agent.”
“Yes, that’s right. Is there a reason you’re asking about him and Mr. Palmer?” she asked. “A mere curiosity, or…?”
Miss Monday gestured again to the body bag. Mrs. Hallward took hold of a pair of straps on her end, and Miss Monday did the same. They hoisted it up and began to haul it down the hall.
“It just seems to me that an operation of this magnitude would require a lot more in terms of personnel. The Agency can’t possibly be handled by Mr. O, Mr. Palmer, and Mr. White alone, can it? It seems strange that I’ve yet to meet any of the Agents, other than Mr. O.”
Miss Monday suppressed a shudder as they walked past the clinically titled Laboratory A. They rounded the corner of the hallway. More offices lined this section of the hallway as well. More nameplates nailed to more doors. Mrs. Hallward hesitated to answer, acting as if it was just that she was distracted by the weight of the cadaver.
“It’s a dangerous job,” she said at last.
“You mean to say that some of the agents have died.”
Mrs. Hallward nodded.
“Recently?” Miss Monday asked.
Mrs. Hallward confirmed with another nod. “The rest of the agents—I’m sure you’ll meet some of them, eventually—have been pulling double duty. There are fewer agents than ever, and the unliving seem to keep piling up.”
“Piling up,” Miss Monday laughed dryly. “An appropriate way to describe it.”
They set the body bag down on the floor. They had arrived at a set of double doors, which distinguished this office from the rest. It was also the only office on the right side of the hall.
The plate on the door indicated that this was the workshop of Dr. Simms, Quartermaster.
“So, will you be joining the Agency?” Mrs. Hallward asked.
“For now,” Miss Monday replied. “I’m not sure what Mr. O has told you about my work, but I have a decision to make, and I cannot make that decision uninformed. Mr. O believes we’ll soon have the information I need. I’ve given him three days.”
Mrs. Hallward gave a tentative nod. Miss Monday couldn’t be sure how much of that her neighbour had understood, but she was not about to go into a longer explanation of her work. Mrs. Hallward knocked on the door.
At first, there was no response from within. Miss Monday began to wonder if perhaps the Quartermaster had stepped out. She was about to say as much to Mrs. Hallward, when at last she heard the sound of approaching footsteps. Then the sound of a latch turning. The door swung inward.
Miss Monday wasn’t quite sure what she’d been expecting, but she was surprised to see such an ancient-looking gentleman looking up at her with a monocle perched upon his wrinkled face. He was short in stature, and his spine was bent with age, so that he seemed to be stooped over. He walked with a cane.
A frosty white moustache covered his lips; it twitched when he spoke. “Yes?” he said, looking up at Miss Monday.
His bushy eyebrows wiggled curiously as he frowned. It seemed to Miss Monday that he was trying to determine if he ought to recognise her or not. Or maybe he was trying to get a better look at her visual prosthesis. Clearly he was struggling with his vision and his memory in his old age. She decided to spare him the trouble.
“Miss Monday, sir,” she said. “Mr. O asked us to bring you this cadaver.”
“A cadaver!” he exclaimed, his eyes lighting up. “How wonderful!”
He seemed almost to dance, as he beckoned the ladies to enter the workshop. “Lovely, lovely,” he muttered. “Well, perhaps lovely is the wrong word. Not that cadavers are lovely, but, well, every cadaver is an opportunity, as I always say.”
Miss Monday managed, with Mrs. Hallward’s assistance, to bring the body into the workshop, where Dr. Simms directed them to a cluttered table in the midst of a cluttered room.
“Boy!” he called.
Apparently the room was much bigger than Miss Monday had initially assumed, for the voice that answered him seemed to come from way off in the distance, somewhere well beyond that enormous pile of wood and scrap metal that she’d mistaken for a wall.
“Coming, sir!” the voice called back.
While he waited, the old man began to clear away the table, lifting piles of books and boxes and carrying them over to a shelf nearby. Miss Monday reached out to help with the task, but Mrs. Hallward grabbed her by the shoulder and held her back.
“Better not,” she said.
A moment later, she understood why. Some of the objects on the table were undoubtably weapons of some kind. A flash of electricity sparked when he touched one of them.
He was still in the process of clearing the table when the boy appeared, ducking beneath a curtain that hung from a rusted pipe on the ceiling.
“My assistant,” he said by way of introduction. Then, turning to the young lad, he added, “We’ve got a body,” as if that was instruction enough.
Apparently it was. The boy set immediately to work, finishing clearing the table, and finally, helping Miss Monday to lift the cadaver onto the table. He opened the bag, letting the terrible odour of the corpse into the air. He rolled the body out of the bag so that she lay, naked, stinking, upon the table.
“Wonderful,” the Quartermaster exclaimed, clasping his hands together with delight.
Then his eyes fell upon the clockwork contraption that was attached to her chest, and his eyes widened. His brow raised.
“Spectacles,” he said, removing the monocle from his eye, and holding it out to his assistant.
A moment later, he had a pair of glasses in hand, and he was raising them to his face.
“Cheap piece of junk,” he complained about the monocle. “Can’t see a damned thing.”
Miss Monday wondered why he'd bothered to put it on in the first place, but he fell silent as he regained his sight and resumed his examination of the cadaver upon the table. With hands unsteadied by palsy, he reached out and took hold of the brass contraption. As if he’d used this device before, he pressed down hard upon a bar that protruded from its centre, and they heard a pneumatic hiss. Then a click.
He removed his hands, but he’d set the device in motion. It bent and unfolded like an accordion, its gears turning and its screws rotating. With a wet plop, it released its attachments to the woman’s chest. Suddenly and without warning, the device closed in on itself, hard and fast, like a bear trap. Finally, it settled, motionless and wet with blood, within the woman’s hollowed chest, which slowly began to deflate like a punctured balloon or a wilting flower.
“What is it?” asked the old man’s assistant.
“It’s a recording device,” said the Quartermaster, still staring at the device. “I imagine that whoever planted it in her had hoped to later retrieve it. Who ever thought of using the unliving for reconnaissance?” he muttered.
“Reconnaissance, sir?” said the assistant.
“Yes. This girl was a spy,” he said, pointing at the dead girl on the slab.
Finally, he looked up. He did a double take when he saw Miss Monday standing before him. It was as if he was seeing her for the first time. His eyes went straight to her prosthesis. They turned back to the device in the dead girls chest, then back to Miss Monday again. He lifted a hand, as if to reach out and probe her clockwork eye, but lowered it without actually doing so.
“Who are you?” he said in a whisper. His voice sounded almost angry.
Miss Monday took a step back, startled by the sudden change in his demeanour.
“Where did you get that?” he demanded. “Where did you get that eye?”</Text>

            <Text>Mr. Sinews estimated that he had about six inches of room through which to squeeze his entire body. He began by leaning on his back and reaching one arm through the gap. He then pushed himself backward with his legs, squeezing his head into the slot, twisting it to one side so that it just barely fit.
“Suppose I become stuck,” said Mr. Sinews, “That suddenly seems a definite possibility.”
“Well, I suppose you will have about an hour before the guards come and extricate you,” said the priest, “And I imagine they will decrease the size of the gap shortly thereafter.”
Mr. Sinews grimaced and, with the arm on the other side of the door, pulled himself further through the slot. He twisted his body so that his shoulders could squeeze through the gap.
“You can’t possibly imagine how uncomfortable this is,” said Mr. Sinews, wincing as lightning flashed and his cell shook violently. Thunder boomed, and Mr. Sinews groaned, struggling to push himself through the slot, one inch at a time.
Eventually, he managed to squeeze his head and shoulders through the gap, and though he breathed a sigh of relief, it was hardly over. Faria had been right. That would be the hard part of the ordeal. But squeezing his chest and legs through the gap would not be easy work.
Twisting his body until it was painful, he silently breathed a thank you to Faria for insisting upon his daily regimen of stretching each morning, without which his escape from his cell would not be merely uncomfortable but impossible.
He squeezed his second arm through the gap. Finally, exhaling all the air from his lungs, he forced his chest painfully through. He sucked in his gut, and forced his stomach through the hole, sliding himself along the still-shaking floor.
Finally, and much to his own surprise, he managed to slide his legs the rest of the way through.
He should have felt relieved at that, but then he recalled that he’d only broken out of his own cell in order to break into Faria’s.

            <Title>Scene 36</Title>
            <Text>There was a ratcheting sound from above and a thunderous boom from deep below. It seemed as if the floor was rising, moving up with surprising speed with the grating sound of grinding metal and slowly revolving gears.
As the elevator shuddered and rattled, the floor continued to rise, and she plunged into near darkness, the only light being the gas lantern above her head, and it suddenly seemed as if she was descending into Hell. All that she could see was the cage-like walls of the elevator, and the machinery of its workings, which propelled her downward. She had no idea what she’d find at the bottom of the shaft.
She lost track of how many stories she’d descended. Her ears popped uncomfortably. She could see a distant light above her, from Palmer’s office. At last, the elevator reached the bottom. She was in an office.
It was nearly identical to the one upstairs.
She managed to release the latch of the elevator’s gate, and exited the claustrophobic space. Her hand hovered near her gun holster, which was concealed beneath a few layers of her skirt, but the office was empty. Her nerves began to settle as she looked around the office.
This office had curtains over the windows, like the one upstairs, though she suspected that if she were to pull them aside, she’d be looking at a bare wall. Still, they provided the comforting illusion that she was not several stories underground. The desk in this office was clearly used regularly. It was covered in scratches, tea stains, and loosely organised sheets of dog-eared and crumpled papers. Annabel skimmed through some of the documents at the top of the pile as she perused the office.
She headed to the door and peered through the pane of glass. The coast appeared to be clear, but she cracked open the door and was careful as she leaned out for a second look. A moment later, she was heading down the hall.
The hallway was brightly lit by lamps in sconces along the wall, and there were no alcoves and no supply closets for her to duck into if she was caught down here. There was a series of doors along the hallway, labeled, like the office doors upstairs, with nameplates.
Abraham Palmer, said the first nameplate. Mrs. Elizabeth Grimmer, said another.
Mr. O’s mother, Annabel thought. She still wasn’t accustomed to thinking of him as Jonathan Grimmer.
What was this underground hideout? Could she really have just discovered the secret hideout of the Resurrectionists? If so, what did the Grimmers have to do with the Resurrectionists? A shared agenda, perhaps? A zombie plague spreading through the city should certainly sell a few newspapers, she thought.
She passed another door. Solomon Grundy, Engineer. She tried the door; it was locked, like the others. Hastily, she tried the set of keys she’d stolen earlier, methodically trying each key in turn, but not one was a match for the lock. She could have tried picking it, but she’d already spent too much time out in the open. Better if she could find an unlocked door.
The next one over was not labelled with the name of any person. It was simply called Alpha Laboratory. She tried the door, and it swung open, much to Annabel’s surprise.
The room was unlit, and appeared to be empty. Annabel entered the room, closing the door behind her. She began lighting the room’s lamps. Even before she’d finished her task, she’d caught a glimpse of an image that would undoubtedly haunt her dreams that night and for nights to come.
She choked back a cry of horror as she stared at an enormous, cylindrical fish tank of thick glass, which stood on one side of the room, the contents of the tank becoming more clear as each new lamp cast light upon the room.
“Oh dearest God in heaven,” she said under her breath, “What in God’s name is that?”</Text>

junction:	Regent Street, Shaftesbury Avenue, The Haymarket, Coventry Street and Glasshouse Street
Construction
Type:	Intersection
Opened:	1819
Piccadilly Circus is a road junction and public space of London's West End in the City of Westminster, built in 1819 to connect Regent Street with the major shopping street of Piccadilly. In this context, a circus, from the Latin word meaning "circle", is a round open space at a street junction. [1]
Piccadilly now links directly to the theatres on Shaftesbury Avenue, as well as the Haymarket, Coventry Street (onwards to Leicester Square), and Glasshouse Street. The Circus is close to major shopping and entertainment areas in the West End. Its status as a major traffic intersection has made Piccadilly Circus a busy meeting place and a tourist attraction in its own right. The Circus is particularly known for its video display and neon signs mounted on the corner building on the northern side, as well as the Shaftesbury memorial fountain and statue of Eros. It is surrounded by several noted buildings, including the London Pavilion and Criterion Theatre. Directly underneath the plaza is Piccadilly Circus tube station, part of the London Underground system.

Piccadilly Circus in 1962


The signs in 1992
Piccadilly Circus connects to Piccadilly, a thoroughfare whose name first appeared in 1626 as Piccadilly Hall, named after a house belonging to one Robert Baker, a tailor famous for selling piccadills, or piccadillies, a term used for various kinds of collars. The street was known as Portugal Street in 1692 in honour of Catherine of Braganza, the queen consort of King Charles II of England but was known as Piccadilly by 1743. Piccadilly Circus was created in 1819, at the junction with Regent Street, which was then being built under the planning of John Nash on the site of a house and garden belonging to a Lady Hutton. The circus lost its circular form in 1886 with the construction of Shaftesbury Avenue.
The junction has been a very busy traffic interchange since construction, as it lies at the centre of Theatreland and handles exit traffic from Piccadilly, which Charles Dickens, Jr. described in 1879: "Piccadilly, the great thoroughfare leading from the Haymarket and Regent-street westward to Hyde Park-corner, is the nearest approach to the Parisian boulevard of which London can boast."
The Piccadilly Circus tube station was opened 10 March 1906, on the Bakerloo Line, and on the Piccadilly Line in December of that year. In 1928, the station was extensively rebuilt to handle an increase in traffic.
The intersection's first electric advertisements appeared in 1910, and, from 1923, electric billboards were set up on the facade of the London Pavilion. Traffic lights were first installed on 3 August 1926, at the junction.
At the start of the 1960s, it was determined that the Circus needed to be redeveloped to allow for greater traffic flow. In 1962, Lord Holford presented a plan which would have created a "double-decker" Piccadilly Circus; the upper deck would have been an elevated pedestrian concourse linking the buildings around the perimeter of the Circus, with the lower deck being solely for traffic, most of the ground-level pedestrian areas having been removed to allow for greater vehicle flow. This concept was kept alive throughout the rest of the 1960s. A final scheme in 1972 proposed three octagonal towers (the highest 240 feet (73 m) tall) to replace the Trocadero, the Criterion and the "Monico" buildings.[2] The plans were permanently rejected by Sir Keith Joseph and Ernest Marples; the key reason given was that Holford's scheme only allowed for a 20% increase in traffic, and the Government required 50%.
The Holford plan is referenced in the short-form documentary film "Goodbye, Piccadilly", produced by the Rank Organisation in 1967 as part of their Look at Life series when it was still seriously expected that Holford's recommendations would be acted upon. Piccadilly Circus has since escaped major redevelopment, apart from extensive ground-level pedestrianisation around its south side in the 1980s.
The Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain in Piccadilly Circus was erected in 1893 to commemorate the philanthropic works of Anthony Ashley Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury. During the Second World War, the statue atop the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain was removed and was replaced by advertising hoardings. It was returned in 1948. When the Circus underwent reconstruction work in the late 1980s, the entire fountain was moved from the centre of the junction at the beginning of Shaftesbury Avenue to its present position at the southwestern corner.

Piccadilly Circus is surrounded by several major tourist attractions, including the Shaftesbury Memorial, Criterion Theatre, London Pavilion and several major retail stores. Numerous nightclubs and bars are located in the area and neighbouring Soho, including the former Chinawhite club.

The Ballet of Change: Piccadilly Circus screening on the Coca-Cola Billboard, 19:30 Friday, 23 November 2007
Piccadilly Circus used to be surrounded by illuminated advertising hoardings on buildings, starting in the early 1900s,[citation needed] but only one building now carries them, the one in the northwestern corner between Shaftesbury Avenue and Glasshouse Street. The site is unnamed (usually referred to as "Monico" after the Café Monico, which used to be on the site); its addresses are 44/48 Regent Street, 1/6 Sherwood Street, 17/22 Denman Street and 1/17 Shaftesbury Avenue, and it has been owned by property investor Land Securities Group since the 1970s.
The earliest signs used incandescent light bulbs; these were replaced with neon lights, as well as moving signs (there was a large Guinness clock at one time).The very first Neon sign was for the British meat extract Bovril.[citation needed] From December 1998, digital projectors were briefly used for the Coke sign, the first to be computerised,[3] while the 2000s saw a gradual move to LED displays, completely replacing neon lamps by 2011. The number of signs has reduced over the years as the rental costs have increased.
As of 2012, the site has six illuminated advertising screens above three large retail units facing Piccadilly Circus on the north side, occupied by Boots, GAP and a mix of smaller retail, restaurant and office premises fronting the other streets. A Burger King located under the Samsung advert, which had been previously a Wimpy Bar until 1989, closed in early 2008 and was converted into a Barclays Bank.
Coca-Cola has had a sign at Piccadilly Circus since 1954. The current placed sign dates in its original form from September 2003, when the previous digital projector board and the site formerly occupied by Nescafé was replaced with a state-of-the-art LED video display that curves round with the building. Before Nescafé, a neon advertisement for Foster's occupied the spot from 1987 until 1999, and from 1978 to 1987 it was used by Philips Electronics. On 23 November 2007, the very first film was broadcast through the board. The screen also displays information about line closures and delays on the London Underground. Paul Atherton's film The Ballet of Change: Piccadilly Circus was allowed five minutes to show the first non-commercial film depicting the history of Piccadilly Circus and the lights. The former, for several months in 2002, replacing the Nescafé sign, was a sign featuring the quote "Imagine all the people living life in peace" by Beatle John Lennon. This was paid for by his widow Yoko Ono, who spent an estimated £150,000 to display an advert at this location.[4]
Hyundai Motors sign is the newest of the six, launching on 29 September 2011.[5] It replaced a sign for Sanyo which had occupied the space since around early 1988 (slightly modified in 2004), the last to be run by traditional neon lights rather than Hyundai's computerised LED screen. Earlier Sanyo signs with older logos had occupied the position since 1978, although these were only half the size of the current space.[6]
TDK added its sign in 1990, the space having been previously used by Schweppes (1920–61), BP (1961–7), Cinzano (1967–78), Fujifilm (1978–86) and Kodak (1986–90). The original neon sign remained almost unchanged for twenty years, although in 2001, the colour of the background lamps was changed from green to blue, and the words "Audio &amp; Video Tape" and "Floppy Disks" under the TDK logo were removed. In 2010, the sign was replaced by an LED screen.
McDonald's added its sign in 1987, replacing one for BASF. The sign was changed from neon to LED in 2001. A bigger, brighter screen was installed in 2008.
Samsung added its sign in November 1994,[7] the space having been previously occupied by Canon (1978–84) and Panasonic (1984–94). The sign was changed from neon to LED in summer 2005. The screen was upgraded and improved in autumn 2011.
Piccadilly Lite was added on 3 December 2007, underneath the Samsung and McDonald's signs. This is an LED screen that allows other companies to advertise for both short- and long-term leases, increasing the amount of advertising space but using the same screen for multiple brands. The space was previously occupied by JVC (1978–84), Carlsberg (1984–2003) and Budweiser (2003–7).[8]
LG were added as of February 2007 on the roof of Coventry House, which diagonally faces Piccadilly Circus. Their sign is a large LED video advertising display for LGE, the British arm of the South Korean electronics group. The new display also incorporates a scrolling ticker of Sky News headlines. Before LG, Vodafone had a neon sign installed on that spot, which displayed both their logo and personal messages that could be submitted on a special website and displayed at a certain time and date.
On special occasions the lights are switched off, such as the deaths of Winston Churchill in 1965 and Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997. On 21 June 2007, they were switched off for one hour as part of the Lights Out London campaign.[9]
Other companies and brands that had previously had signs on the site were Guinness, Max Factor, Wrigley's Spearmint, Skol, Air India and Gold Flake (as Will's Gold Flake Cigarettes).


Piccadilly Circus memorial fountain with Anteros, popularly referred to as Eros or sometimes The Angel of Christian Charity, one of the first statues to be cast in aluminium
At the southwestern side of the Circus, moved after World War II from its original position in the centre, stands the Shaftesbury Monument Memorial Fountain, erected in 1892–1893 to commemorate the philanthropic works of Lord Shaftesbury, who was a famous Victorian politician and philanthropist.
The monument is topped by Alfred Gilbert's winged nude statue originally intended to be the Greek god Anteros, sometimes referred to as The Angel of Christian Charity but generally known as his brother, Eros. The statue has become a London icon: a graphical illustration of it is used as the symbol of the Evening Standard newspaper and appears on its masthead.
The use of a nude figure on a public monument was controversial at the time of its construction, but it was generally well received by the public. The Magazine of Art described it as "...a striking contrast to the dull ugliness of the generality of our street sculpture, ... a work which, while beautifying one of our hitherto desolate open spaces, should do much towards the elevation of public taste in the direction of decorative sculpture, and serve freedom for the metropolis from any further additions of the old order of monumental monstrosities."
The statue was the first in the world to be cast in aluminium and is set on a bronze fountain, which itself inspired the marine motifs that Gilbert carved on the statue.
While the statue is generally believed to depict Eros, it was created as an image of his twin brother, Anteros.[10] The sculptor Alfred Gilbert had already sculpted a statue of Anteros and, when commissioned for the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain, chose to reproduce the same subject, who, as "The God of Selfless Love" was deemed to represent the philanthropic 7th Earl of Shaftesbury suitably. Gilbert described Anteros as portraying "reflective and mature love, as opposed to Eros or Cupid, the frivolous tyrant." The model for the sculpture was Gilbert's studio assistant, a 16-year-old Italian, Angelo Colarossi (born 1875).[11]
Where Anteros originally pointed his bow is the subject of two urban myths. The first is that the archer is aiming up Shaftesbury Avenue. Sometimes, the story goes that this was a visual pun to commemorate the great philanthropist. If the archer were to release his arrow, its shaft would bury itself in Shaftesbury Avenue. The other is that the arrow is pointing to the Earl's country seat in Wimborne Saint Giles, Dorset. However, the 1896 photographs (on this page) of the circus taken only three years after the statue's erection clearly shows the arrow pointing in a different direction, down Lower Regent Street aptly towards Parliament. This is proven by the position relative to the statue of Shaftesbury Avenue, the London Pavilion and the Criterion Theatre.
When the memorial was unveiled, there were numerous complaints. Some felt it was sited in a vulgar part of town (the theatre district), and others felt that it was too sensual as a memorial for a famously sober and respectable Earl. Some of the objections were tempered by renaming the statue as The Angel of Christian Charity[citation needed], which was the nearest approximation that could be invented in Christian terms for the role Anteros played in the Greek pantheon. However the name never became widely known and the statue became generally known as Eros, the god of sensual love; quite inappropriate to commemorate the Earl, but just right to signify the carnal neighbourhood of London, into which Soho had developed.
In May 2012 the Statue of Anteros had a new bow string fitted after it was broken by a tourist[12]
Main article: Criterion Theatre
The Criterion Theatre, a Grade II* listed building, stands on the south side of Piccadilly Circus. Apart from the box office area, the entire theatre, with nearly 600 seats, is underground and is reached by descending a tiled stairway. Columns are used to support both the dress circle and the upper circle, restricting the views of many of the seats inside.
The theatre was designed by Thomas Verity and opened as a theatre on 21 March 1874, although original plans were for it to become a concert hall. In 1883, it was forced to close to improve ventilation and to replace gaslights with electric lights and was reopened the following year. The theatre closed in 1989 and was extensively renovated, reopening in October 1992.
Main article: London Pavilion
On the northeastern side of Piccadilly Circus, on the corner between Shaftesbury Avenue and Coventry Street, is the London Pavilion. The first building bearing the name was built in 1859 and was a music hall. In 1885, Shaftesbury Avenue was built through the former site of the Pavilion, and a new London Pavilion was constructed, which also served as a music hall. In 1923, electric billboards were erected on the side of the building.


Facade of the London Pavilion in 2002
In 1934, the building underwent significant structural alteration and was converted into a cinema. In 1986, the building was rebuilt, preserving the 1885 facade, and converted into a shopping arcade. In 2000, the building was connected to the neighbouring Trocadero Centre, and signage on the building was altered in 2003 to read "London Trocadero". The basement of the building connects with Piccadilly Circus tube station.
The former Swan &amp; Edgar department store on the west side of the circus between Piccadilly and Regent Street was built in 1920–23 to a design by Reginald Blomfield.[13] Since the closure of the department store in the early 1980s, the building has been successively the flagship London store of music chains Tower Records, Virgin Megastore and Zavvi. The current occupier is clothing brand The Sting.
Lillywhites is a major retailer of sporting goods located on the corner of the circus and Lower Regent Street, next to the Shaftesbury fountain. It moved to its present site in 1925. Lillywhites is popular with tourists, and they regularly offer sale items, including international football jerseys up to 90% off. Nearby Fortnum &amp; Mason is often considered to be part of the Piccadilly Circus shopping area and is known for its expansive food hall.[14]



Inside Piccadilly Circus tube station
Main article: Piccadilly Circus tube station
The Piccadilly Circus station on the London Underground is located directly beneath Piccadilly Circus itself, with entrances at every corner. It is one of the few stations which have no associated buildings above ground and is fully underground. It is itself a Grade 2 listed building.
The station is on the Piccadilly Line between Green Park and Leicester Square, and the Bakerloo Line between Charing Cross and Oxford Circus.
Metronet, until 2008 one of the two private maintenance companies for the London Underground under a public-private partnership arrangement, refurbished Piccadilly Circus station with work started in March 2005 and completed in spring 2007. Major improvements included new floor and wall finishes, a new CCTV system, new help points, a new public address system, new electronic information displays and clocks, improved platform seating, waterproofing measures, measures to assist visually impaired passengers and improved lighting. Moving stairs or escalators were also replaced.

Main article: Piccadilly Circus in popular culture


Picadilly Circus, 1969; From the portfolio Untitled (Five Overpainted Picadilly Prints).
The phrase it's like Piccadilly Circus is commonly used in the UK to refer to a place or situation which is extremely busy with people. It has been said that a person who stays long enough at Piccadilly Circus will eventually bump into everyone they know. Probably because of this connection, during World War II, "Piccadilly Circus" was the code name given to the Allies' D-Day invasion fleet's assembly location in the English Channel.[15]
Piccadilly Circus has inspired artists and musicians. Piccadilly Circus (1912) is the name and subject of a painting by British artist Charles Ginner, part of the Tate Britain collection. Sculptor Paul McCarthy also has a 320-page two-volume edition of video stills by the name of Piccadilly Circus.
L. S. Lowry R.A painting 'Piccadilly Circus, London' (1960), part of Lord Charles Forte's collection for almost three decades,[16] sold for £5,641,250 when auctioned for the first time at Christie's 20th Century British &amp; Irish Art sale on 16 November 2011.[17]

“Did you know?” she demanded.
“Know what?”
She holstered her pistol, but kept a firm grip on the scientist and kept the other boffins in her sight. Threat lingered in her eyes, and they kept their wary distance. These were doctors, not soldiers. Even if they were brainwashed, they seemed likely not to intervene so long as she retained the upper hand.
“That we would be too late,” she said to Abraham. “I knew not to trust that wretched woman.”
“Mrs. Grimmer?”
“She knew, didn’t she?” Annabel insisted. “She sent Steen, Hatton, and Oceleot to Trafalgar Square; Merrick, Ashcroft, and Lockwood to Hyde Park; and she went to Borough Market. Each of the sites where the Lazarus Virus was to be spread. But it was a wild goose chase, because she sent them there too late. And as for us, she led the pair of us straight into the den of snakes. She’s been with them all along, Mr. Palmer.”
Abraham shook his head.
“Nah,” he said. “Mrs. Grimmer’s still on your side.”
“You mean our side?”
Again, Abraham shook his head.
“Your side.”
He took a step back. Annabel reached for her gun, but it was missing from her holster. She looked down and found the gun, in Mr. Palmer’s hand.
“But you’re not brainwashed,” she said, dumbfounded. “Why would you…?”
“How do you know? Because my brain’s not scrambled like his? Memory loss isn’t even a side effect. Look, notice these red marks on his skin? Physical evidence is the only clear sign that someone’s under the influence of the serum.”
Annabel shook her head in disbelief. She'd made the stupid assumption of thinking that Simms' scrambled brain was a result of being brainwashed. And she'd trusted Grimmer because he didn't have that symptom, so she'd assumed he wasn't brainwashed. Stupid of her to make assumptions.
“So, are you?” she said.
He shrugged.
“I may be compromised, but not by any serum. I’m in it for the money and the immortality.”
“You’re incorrigible,” she said. “You saved my life, helped me get out of this place. You shot at your fellow Resurrectionists. You took a bullet for me!”
“Yes, well, that wasn’t the plan,” he admitted. “And I only saved you so I could get you out of the way. Turns out it worked quite nicely, if I may say so myself. Now that old Lazarus has been spread, there ain’t much use in pretending any more, is there?”
“So what happens now? Are you going to kill me?”
“Guess we’ll see what Mr. Tidkins wants to do with you. Maybe we’ll ship you off to Chateau D’If.”
He gestured with the gun, directing her to the hallway. He closed the door behind him, keeping his gun trained on her all the while. But even with the gun pointed at her, this might be her best chance to regain control of the situation.
She stepped towards him, sidestepping to anticipate his gunshot. As predicted, the gun went off, only narrowly missing her. She struck at his gun arm, and the weapon flew from his hand. She watched as it slid along the floor, well out of reach, and slammed her knee into Mr. Palmer’s gut. He doubled over, but she wasn’t finished with him yet. She followed up with an uppercut to his jaw, knocking a tooth loose.
He spat blood onto the floor and retaliated with a right hook, catching her off guard. He struck her cheek, and she staggered back. Even as she was struggling to regain her balance, he hit her again, this time square in the eye. He hit her again, each blow more brutal than the last. She fell to the floor.
She watched as he turned away from her, slowly, confidently making his way to the gun. She crawled to her feet.
“I’m not finished with you yet,” she told him.
He paused, turned around, and scoffed at her. Her lip was bloody, her eye was swollen. She looked like she could barely stand upright. He turned away, again going for the gun.
She attacked while his back was turned, kicking him in the soft spot behind the knee. He hit the ground hard with one knee, and Annabel kicked him again, this time in the back. He fell flat on his face. She grabbed the gun, relieved to feel it in her hand.
She stood up, aimed the gun at the back of Abraham’s skull, and cocked the pistol. But before she could pull the trigger, she heard a voice from behind her, muffled by a Resurrectionist’s mask but still recognisable. She kept her foot on Abraham’s back to keep him pinned to the floor, and looked over her shoulder. How he’d crept up on her so silently, she hadn’t the slightest idea, but she recognised him immediately. Her recognition did little to calm her.
His mask still strapped to his head, but pulled up to sit upon his forehead instead of his face, he stood before her. Anthony Tidkins. The Resurrection Man. Scientist, leader of a the Murder Club. To the city of London, he was a scourge. To Annabel, he was just Jack.
“Is it really too late?” she asked him.
“For London, or for us?”
He had taken off the mask, which he now held in one hand.
“For London,” she replied. Careful not to let her emotion show, she looked him in the eye and with careful inflection, she told him, “It is most definitely too late for us.”
He nodded.
“Fair enough.”
Perhaps she was mistaken, but she thought she detected a hint of regret in his pale red eyes, a note of sadness in his voice. Damn him, what did she care about his sadness, mass murderer that he was? She felt sick to think of what he had done.
“It is too late for London as well,” he added.
Her stomach clenched. She couldn’t understand why he’d done it. Jack had always had such endearing respect for life. Every life, precious, every single one. Even hers. That’s why he’d saved her all those years ago. Now he had destroyed a city of millions.
“Why, Jack?” she asked him.
“Because my father is dying,” he said simply.
It took her only a moment.
“Dr. Allen is your father?”
“I was his bastard son,” he explained. “He and my mother gave me up for adoption. My adoptive parents were unable to have children of their own. When my mother died, my father came to resent me, as if it was somehow my fault. He sent me to live with Dr. Allen. He said it was because Dr. Allen was a renowned surgeon, and he wanted me to be trained by him, but we both knew that was a lie. I believed it was because he didn’t want me any more. It was only later, much later, that I learned the real reason I’d been sent to Dr. Allen. Yes, he is my real father.”
“And you think this will save him?” Annabel asked.
She returned her attention to Mr. Palmer, who was trying to get up. She kicked him in the back, and he grunted in pain. She looked again at Jack.
Her hand was trembling, her vision unclear. She steeled herself. Before she could put further thought into it, she raised the pistol. Point blank, she aimed its muzzle at her oldest friend and put her finger on the trigger.</Text>

            <Text>It was smell of baking bread that brought Annabel back.
She was a little girl again, creeping through the windows of the baker’s shop, seizing the largest loaf with her little grubby hands while her accomplice hoisted her up. The loaf was hot and it burned her hands, but little Annabel was starving, so she refused to drop it. Even when the baker spotted her.
“Get me down!” she shouted down to her friend.
A moment later, they were running through the streets, tearing the loaf into even as they bobbed between street vendors and passing cabriolets, wolfing down the steaming hot bread even as a policeman caught sight of them and hollered after them.
They ducked into an alleyway, tore past blind beggars, butchers, fishmongers and women offering up their bodies for little more than pennies. The policeman was left behind as easily as the baker had been. At last, hearts pounding, Annabel stopped, leaned against a brick building, and tore into the loaf of bread.
“Mm,” she said grinning around the mouthful of warm bread. “Told you it’d be easy,” she said.
“Sure,” her friend replied, wheezing still from the mad dash through the busy streets of London. “Easy.”</Text>

            <Title>London Docklands</Title>
            <Text>
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


The O2 and Canary Wharf from the Royal Victoria Dock.
London Docklands is the semi-official name for an area in east and southeast London, England. It forms part of the boroughs of Southwark, Tower Hamlets, Lewisham, Newham and Greenwich. The docks were formerly part of the Port of London, at one time the world's largest port. They have now been redeveloped principally for commercial and residential use. The name London Docklands was used for the first time in a government report on redevelopment plans in 1971 but has since become virtually universally adopted. It also created conflict between the new and old communities of the London Docklands.

In Roman and medieval times, ships tended to dock at small quays in the present-day city of London or Southwark, an area known as the Pool of London. However, this gave no protection against the elements, was vulnerable to thieves and suffered from a lack of space at the quayside. The Howland Great Dock in Rotherhithe (built 1696 and later forming the core of the Surrey Commercial Docks) was designed to address these problems, providing a large, secure and sheltered anchorage with room for 120 large vessels. It was a major commercial success and provided for two phases of expansion during the Georgian and Victorian eras. The first of the Georgian docks was the West India (opened 1802), followed by the London (1805), the East India (also 1805), the Surrey (1807), St Katharine (1828) and the West India South (1829). The Victorian docks were mostly further east, comprising the Royal Victoria (1855), Millwall (1868) and Royal Albert (1880). The King George V Dock was a late addition in 1921.
The London Docklands was bombed during the Second World War, and was hit by over 2,500 bombs, and since then has been significantly redeveloped.



The London docks in 1882. The King George V Dock had not yet been built.
Three principal kinds of docks existed. Wet docks were where ships were laid up at anchor and loaded or unloaded. Dry docks, which were far smaller, took individual ships for repairing. Ships were built at dockyards along the riverside. In addition, the river was lined with innumerable warehouses, piers, jetties and dolphins (mooring points). The various docks tended to specialise in different forms of produce. The Surrey Docks concentrated on timber, for instance; Millwall took grain; St Katharine took wool, sugar and rubber; and so on.
The docks required an army of workers, chiefly lightermen (who carried loads between ships and quays aboard small barges called lighters) and quayside workers, who dealt with the goods once they were ashore. Some of the workers were highly skilled - the lightermen had their own livery company or guild, while the deal porters (workers who carried timber) were famous for their acrobatic skills. Most were unskilled and worked as casual labourers. They assembled at certain points, such as pubs, each morning, where they were selected more or less at random by foremen. For these workers, it was effectively a lottery as to whether they would get work - and pay, and food - on any particular day. This arrangement continued until as late as 1965, although it was somewhat regularised after the creation of the National Dock Labour Scheme in 1947.
The main dockland areas were originally low-lying marshes, mostly unsuitable for agriculture and lightly populated. With the establishment of the docks, the dock workers formed a number of tight-knit local communities with their own distinctive cultures and slang. Poor communications meant that they were quite remote from other parts of London and so tended to develop in some isolation. The Isle of Dogs, for instance, had only two roads in and out. Local sentiment was so strong that in 1920 residents blocked the roads and declared independence.[citation needed]



Museum of London Docklands, near Canary Wharf
The docks were originally built and managed by a number of competing private companies. From 1909, they were managed by the Port of London Authority, or PLA, which amalgamated the companies in a bid to make the docks more efficient and improve labour relations. The PLA constructed the last of the docks, the King George V, in 1921, as well as greatly expanding the Tilbury docks.
Main article: The Blitz
German bombing during the Second World War caused massive damage to the docks with 380,000 tons of timber destroyed in the Surrey Docks in a single night. Nonetheless, following post-war rebuilding they experienced a resurgence of prosperity in the 1950s. The end came suddenly, between approximately 1960 and 1970, when the shipping industry adopted the newly invented container system of cargo transportation. London's docks were unable to accommodate the much larger vessels needed by containerization and the shipping industry moved to deep-water ports such as Tilbury and Felixstowe. Between 1960 and 1980, all of London's docks were closed, leaving around eight square miles (21 km²) of derelict land in East London. Unemployment was high, and poverty and other social problems were rife.



Canary Wharf at sunset
Efforts to redevelop the docks began almost as soon as they were closed, although it took a decade for most plans to move beyond the drawing board and another decade for redevelopment to take full effect. The situation was greatly complicated by the large number of landowners involved: the PLA, the Greater London Council (GLC), the British Gas Corporation, five borough councils, British Rail and the Central Electricity Generating Board.
To address this problem, in 1981 the Secretary of State for the Environment, Michael Heseltine, formed the London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) to redevelop the area. This was a statutory body appointed and funded by central government (a quango), with wide powers to acquire and dispose of land in the Docklands. It also served as the development planning authority for the area.
Another important government intervention was the designation in 1982 of an enterprise zone, an area in which businesses were exempt from property taxes and had other incentives, including simplified planning and capital allowances. This made investing in the Docklands a significantly more attractive proposition and was instrumental in starting a property boom in the area.
LDDC was controversial - it was accused of favouring elitist luxury developments rather than affordable housing, and it was unpopular with the local communities, who felt that their needs were not being addressed. Nonetheless, the LDDC was central to a remarkable transformation in the area, although how far it was in control of events is debatable. It was wound up in 1998 when control of the Docklands area was handed back to the respective local authorities.
The massive development programme managed by the LDDC during the 1980s and 1990s saw a huge area of the Docklands converted into a mixture of residential, commercial and light industrial space. The clearest symbol of the whole effort was the ambitious Canary Wharf project that constructed Britain's tallest building and established a second major financial centre in London. However, there is no evidence that LDDC foresaw this scale of development and nearby Heron Quays had already been developed as low density offices when Canary Wharf was proposed, with similar development already underway on Canary Wharf itself, Limehouse Studios being the most famous occupant.
Canary Wharf was far from trouble free and the property slump of the early 1990s halted development for several years. Developers found themselves saddled with property which they were unable to sell or let.
The Docklands historically had poor transport connections. This was addressed by the LDDC with the construction of the Docklands Light Railway (DLR), which connected the Docklands with the City. It was a remarkably inexpensive development, costing only £77 m in its first phase, as it relied on reusing disused railway infrastructure and derelict land for much of its length. (LDDC originally requested a full Tube line, but the Government refused to fund it.)
LDDC also built Limehouse Link tunnel, a cut and cover road tunnel linking the Isle of Dogs to The Highway (the A13 road) at a cost of over £150 million per kilometre, one of the most expensive stretches of road ever built.
The LDDC also contributed to the development of London City Airport (IATA airport code LCY), opened in October 1987 on the spine of the Royal Docks.

Over the past 30 years, the population of the Docklands has more than doubled and the area has become both a major business centre and an increasingly desirable area to live. Transport links have improved significantly, with the Isle of Dogs gaining a tube connection via the Jubilee Line Extension (opened 1999) and the DLR being extended to Beckton, Lewisham, London City Airport, North Woolwich and Stratford. Canary Wharf has become one of Europe's biggest clusters of skyscrapers and a direct challenge to the financial dominance of the City.
Although most of the old Dockland wharfs and warehouses have been demolished, some have been restored and converted into flats. Most of the docks themselves have survived and are now used as marinas or watersports centres (the major exception being the Surrey Commercial Docks, now largely filled in). Although large ships can - and occasionally still do - visit the old docks, all of the commercial traffic has moved down-river.
The revival of the Docklands has had major effects in run-down surrounding areas. Greenwich and Deptford are undergoing large-scale redevelopment, chiefly as a result of the improved transport links making them more attractive to commuters.
The Docklands' redevelopment has, however, had some less beneficial aspects. The massive property boom and consequent rise in house prices has led to friction between the new arrivals and the old Docklands communities, who have complained of being squeezed out. It has also made for some of the most striking disparities to be seen anywhere in Britain: luxury executive flats constructed alongside run-down public housing estates.
The Docklands' status as a symbol of Thatcher's Britain has also made it a target for terrorists. After a failed attempt to bomb Canary Wharf in 1992, a large IRA bomb exploded at South Quay on 9 February 1996. Two people died in the explosion, forty people were injured and an estimated £150m of damage was caused.[1] This bombing ended an IRA ceasefire.[2] In a 1998 trial James McArdle was imprisoned for 25 years after a trial at Woolwich Crown Court that ended on 24 June. Under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, McArdle was released on 28 June 2000.
London Docklands also now boasts its own free newspaper, The Docklands, launched in 2006 by Archant London, following the purchase of Docklands News, the ex LDDC newspaper which was then owned by Ivy Communications. The title is a mixture of news, sport and lifestyle, and comes out every Tuesday. It is delivered to properties in the area and available to pick up from various locations in Canary Wharf, Greenwich and the Royal Docks. It is the newspaper with the highest circulation in the area. A sister title, The Peninsula, was launched in 2007, covering the Greenwich Peninsula.
In a further sign of regeneration in the area, the Docklands now has its own symphony orchestra - Docklands Sinfonia - which was formed in January 2009 and is based at St Anne's Limehouse.[3]

The continued success of the Docklands redevelopment has prompted a number of further development schemes, including:
Extensions of the Docklands Light Railway possibly to Dagenham.
Crossrail mainline link between Canary Wharf, central London and Heathrow Airport.
Further development of Canada Water.
Redevelopment of Blackwall Basin and Wood Wharf, east of Canary Wharf
New skyscrapers to be built at Canary Wharf including the Riverside South towers, the Heron Quays West double-skyscraper development and the North Quay project, consisting of three towers.
In the early 21st century redevelopment is spreading into the more suburban parts of East and Southeast London, and into the parts of the counties of Kent and Essex which abut the Thames Estuary. See Thames Gateway and Lower Lea Valley for further information on this trend.

At one time the offices of The Independent group of publications were situated in the Docklands. In 2008 Independent News &amp; Media announced that The Independent would be moving its offices to the Northcliffe House in Kensington.[4]

Charles Dickens makes frequent use of the riverside and docklands in novels such as Our Mutual Friend and Great Expectations, and there is a memorable description of the docks, their buildings and people, in Joseph Conrad's The Mirror of the Sea. The Docklands are also the location of District 1, the most functional section of Britain during the outbreak of Rage Virus and the headquarters for Army Officials in Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's 2007 movie 28 Weeks Later. The docklands also appear in The Ruby in the Smoke, a novel by Philip Pullman.
In the comedy Not Going Out, the main characters live in a flat located in the Docklands.

            <Text>“Miss Monday?” Jonathan asked. “Not Mr. Monday? You’re certain?”
“Positive,” Mrs. Thompson confirmed.
Obviously, Miss Monday had some connection to the man he’d encountered at Lord Connor’s, but who was she? Monday’s sister? His daughter? Whoever she was, it was clear that Mr. Monday had sent her. Jonathan felt unsettled, knowing how easily Monday had tracked him down. Even if Monday wasn’t a Resurrectionist, if he’d managed to find Jonathan this easily, the Resurrectionists could do the same. He wondered what Monday wanted with him.
“Thank you, Mrs. Thompson,” he said. “If you could do me a favor? Don’t mention to anyone else that I was at Lord Connor’s.”
After a nod from Mrs. Thompson, Jonathan headed for the printing room. He scanned the room for Palmer, his assistant editor, but there was no sign of him in the printing room. He hurried through the noisy space for the relative quiet of the hallway, and quickly found his way to Palmer’s office. He knocked on the door.
Just as Jonathan was about to conclude that Palmer wasn’t in, the door swung open.
“Jonathan!” the older man exclaimed, “It’s good you’re here. It’s been quite the day for us here. Come in, come in.”
Palmer’s office was practically identical to Jonathan’s father’s—his—office. Desk on one side, shelves along the wall, a sturdy lamp in the corner. A gold and red carpet on the floor. Jonathan grabbed a chair and made himself comfortable, while Palmer shut the door behind them.
“I trust you heard about…” Palmer began. There simply weren’t words for what was happening.
“Mrs. Thompson informed me as I came in.”
Palmer took a seat in the chair facing him. The chair let out a wheeze of air as Palmer settled into it, the old chair creaking noisily.
Jonathan had known Palmer for most of his life. He had been with the Grimmer Company for so long now that Jonathan practically considered him family. Palmer was in his fourties, had dark brown hair that was quickly becoming more and more speckled with grey, and spoke with an American accent. Jonathan often wondered when Palmer had come to London, and why.
“Dreadful business,” he said, “I hope you don’t mind my going straight to the press without waiting for your approval.”
Jonathan dismissed his concern with a wave of his hand.
“I’m sure our competitors were just as quick to catch wind of what happened.”
“Precisely so,” Palmer agreed, “We couldn’t afford to stand idle while the other papers hit the streets this morning. We should have a special edition ready for this evening.”
“Good,” said Jonathan idly. “That’s good.”
He had to give Palmer credit. The man was practical, reliable. Even in crisis, he could be depended upon to keep the company running.
“Mr. Palmer, I trust you to do what’s right for this company,” Jonathan told him.
“Thank you, Mr. Grimmer. I appreciate that.”
Jonathan decided to cut to the chase. “I’m going to leave running the company in your capable hands, for now at least. I need to concentrate on finding the Resurrection Man.”
Palmer nearly spat out his coffee. He set his cup down on his desk, leaving a ring of coffee on the topmost sheet of paper on the pile.
“What do you mean? Why?”
Jonathan chewed on his lip, giving the question some thought. He wasn’t sure he wanted to go into the details. “I’m working on a story,” he said simply. “I want to interview Anthony Tidkins.”
“Jonathan,” said Mr. Palmer, in the stern tone of a father speaking to his son. “Our focus should be on reporting these acts of violence that are happening all throughout the city.”
Jonathan shook his head. He stood up so that he was looking down at Palmer. Mr. Palmer might be Jonathan’s senior, but Jonathan was the head of the company now. He needed Palmer’s cooperation, not his advice.
“Mr. Palmer, I believe Anthony Tidkins is central to these acts of violence.”
“What do you mean?”
“The Resurrectionists were studying a disease. Tidkins called it the Lazarus Virus. You may have heard about it; Tidkins apparently published a paper on the subject before he went into hiding.”
“Yes, I remember,” said Palmer, “If I recall correctly, the virus is supposed to bring the dead to life, as zombies. But what does that have to do with these acts of violence?”
“I believe these acts of violence are being committed by zombies,” Jonathan said.
Palmer scoffed. “That’s quite the theory,” he said. “Look, sit down, won’t you, Mr. Grimmer? I’ll tell you what I can about the Resurrection Man, if that will get you to calm down. But first, tell me, where is this coming from? Surely you must know how that sounds. I mean, really. Zombies, Mr. Grimmer? You must know we can’t go to print with that.”
“I don’t care how it sounds, Mr. Palmer,” Jonathan replied, but he sat down. “Just tell me what you know about Anthony Tidkins.”
Palmer sighed. “You seem quite determined,” he said.
“I am,” Jonathan assured him.
“And you’re sure you can’t be persuaded to give up looking for the Resurrection Man?”
Jonathan shook his head. “No.”
“Very well,” said Palmer. “I’ll tell you what I know about the Resurrection Man.”</Text>

The London Underground (also known as the Underground or the Tube) is a public rapid transit system serving a large part of Greater London and parts of the counties of Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire and Essex. The system serves 270 stations and has 402 kilometres (250 mi) of track, 55 per cent of which is actually above ground. The network incorporates the world's first underground railway, the Metropolitan Railway which opened in 1863 and now forms part of the Circle, Hammersmith &amp; City and Metropolitan lines, and also the first line to operate underground electric traction trains, the City &amp; South London Railway in 1890, now part of the Northern line.[3] The network has expanded to consist of 11 lines and in 2011/12 it carried over 1 billion passengers.
The system's first tunnels were built just below the surface using the cut and cover method. Later, circular tunnels – which give rise to its nickname the Tube – were dug through the London Clay at a deeper level. The early lines were marketed as the UNDERGROUND in the early 20th century on maps and signs at central London stations. The private companies that owned and ran the railways were merged in 1933 to form the London Passenger Transport Board. The current operator London Underground Limited (LUL) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Transport for London (TfL), the statutory corporation responsible for most elements of the transport network in Greater London.
As of 2012, 91 per cent of operational expenditure is covered by passenger fares.[4] The Travelcard ticket was introduced in 1983 and Oyster, an electronic ticketing system, in 2003.
Today in official publicity and in general, the term 'Tube' embraces the whole Underground system, not just the lines that run in deep-level tunnels.[5] The schematic Tube map, designed by Harry Beck in 1931, was voted a national design icon in 2006 and now includes other lines - the Docklands Light Railway and London Overground - as well as the non-rail Emirates Air Line. London Underground is celebrating 150 years of operations in 2013, with various events to mark the milestone.[6]

The Metropolitan Railway opened using GWR broad gauge locomotives
The idea of an underground railway linking the City of London with the railway termini in its urban centre was proposed in the 1830s,[7] and the Metropolitan Railway was granted permission to build such a line in 1854.[8] The world's first underground railway, it opened in January 1863 between Paddington and Farringdon using gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives.[9] It was hailed as a success, carrying 38,000 passengers on the opening day, borrowing trains from other railways to supplement the service.[10] The Metropolitan District Railway (commonly known as the District Railway) opened in December 1868 from South Kensington to Westminster as part of a plan for an underground 'inner circle' connecting London's main-line termini.[11] The Metropolitan and District railways completed the Circle line in 1884,[12] built using the cut and cover method where below the surface.[13] Both railways expanded, the District building five branches to the west reaching Ealing, Hounslow,[14] Uxbridge,[15] Richmond and Wimbledon[14] and the Metropolitan eventually extended as far as Verney Junction in Buckinghamshire, more than 50 miles (80 km) from Baker Street and the centre of London.[16] For the first deep-level tube line, the City and South London Railway, two 10 feet 2 inches (3.10 m) diameter circular tunnels were dug between King William Street (close to today's Monument station) and Stockwell, under the roads to avoid the need for agreement with owners of property on the surface. This opened in 1890 with electric locomotives that hauled carriages with small opaque windows, nicknamed padded cells.[17] The Waterloo and City Railway opened in 1898,[18] followed by the Central London Railway in 1900, known as the "twopenny tube".[19] These two ran electric trains in circular tunnels having diameters between 11 feet 8 inches (3.56 m) and 12 feet 2 inches (3.71 m),[20] whereas the Great Northern and City Railway, which opened in 1904, was built to take main line trains from Finsbury Park to a Moorgate terminus in the City and had 16 feet (4.9 m) diameter tunnels.[21]


Passengers wait to board a tube train in the early 1900s
In the early 20th century the District and Metropolitan railways needed to electrify and a joint committee recommended an AC system, the two companies co-operating because of the shared ownership of the inner circle. The District, needing to raise the finance necessary, found an investor in the American Charles Yerkes who favoured a DC system similar to that in use on the City &amp; South London and Central London railways. The Metropolitan Railway protested about the change of plan, but after arbitration by the Board of Trade the DC system was adopted.[22] Yerkes soon had control of the District Railway and established the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) in 1902 to finance and operate three tube lines, the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (Bakerloo), the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (Hampstead) and the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway, (Piccadilly), which all opened between 1906 and 1907.[23][24] When the 'Bakerloo' was so named in July 1906, The Railway Magazine called it an undignified "gutter title".[24] By 1907 the District and Metropolitan Railways had electrified the underground sections of their lines.[25] A joint marketing agreement between most of the companies in the early years of the 20th century included maps, joint publicity, through ticketing and UNDERGROUND signs outside stations in Central London.[26] The Bakerloo line was extended north to Queen's Park to join a new electric line from Euston to Watford, but World War I delayed construction and trains reached Watford Junction in 1917. During air raids in 1915 people used the tube stations as shelters.[27] An extension of the Central line east to Ealing was also delayed by the war and completed in 1920.[28] After the war government-backed financial guarantees were used to expand the network and the tunnels of the City and South London and Hampstead railways were linked at Euston and Kennington,[29] although the combined service was not named the Northern line until later.[30] The Metropolitan promoted housing estates near the railway with the "Metro-land" brand and nine housing estates were built near stations on the line. Electrification was extended north from Harrow to Rickmansworth, and branches opened from Rickmansworth to Watford in 1925 and from Wembley Park to Stanmore in 1932.[31][32] The Piccadilly line was extended north to Cockfosters and took over District line branches to Harrow (later Uxbridge) and Hounslow.[33]
In 1933, London's underground railways, tramway and bus operators were merged to form the London Passenger Transport Board, which became known as London Transport,[34] and Harry Beck's diagrammatic tube map appeared for the first time.[35] The outlying lines of the former Metropolitan Railway closed, the Brill Tramway in 1935, and the line from Quainton Road to Verney Junction in 1936.[36] The 1935–40 New Works Programme included the extension of the Central and Northern lines and the Bakerloo line to take over the Metropolitan's Stanmore branch.[37] World War II suspended these plans after the Bakerloo line had reached Stanmore and the Northern line High Barnet and Mill Hill East in 1941.[38] During the war many tube stations were used as air-raid shelters.[39] Following bombing in 1940 passenger services over the West London Line were suspended, leaving Olympia exhibition centre without a railway service until a District line shuttle from Earl's Court began after the war.[40] After work restarted on the Central line extensions in east and west London, these were complete in 1949.[41] After Britain's railways were nationalised in 1948 the reconstruction of the main line railways was given priority over the maintenance of the Underground and most of the unfinished plans of the pre-war New Works Programme were shelved or postponed.[42]
However, the District line needed new trains and an unpainted aluminium train entered service in 1953, this becoming the standard for new trains.[43] In the early 1960s the Metropolitan line was electrified as far as Amersham, British Rail providing services for the former Metropolitan line stations between Amersham and Aylesbury.[44] The Victoria line was dug under central London and, unlike the earlier tubes, the tunnels did not follow the roads above. The line opened in 1968–71 with the trains being driven automatically and magnetically encoded tickets collected by automatic gates gave access to the platforms.[45] In 1976 the isolated Northern City Line was taken over by British Rail and linked up with the main line railway at Finsbury Park.[46]

In 1979 another new tube, the Jubilee line, named in honour of Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee, took over the Stanmore branch from the Bakerloo line[47] and was extended through to the Docklands in 1999.[48] Under the control of the Greater London Council, London Transport introduced a system of fare zones for buses and underground trains that cut the average fare in 1981. Fares increased following a legal challenge but the fare zones were retained, and in the mid-1980s the Travelcard and the Capitalcard were introduced.[49] To comply with new safety regulations issued as a result of the King's Cross fire and to combat graffiti a train refurbishment project was launched in July 1991.[50][51] In 1984 control of London Buses and the London Underground passed to London Regional Transport (LRT), which reported directly to Secretary of State for Transport.[52] One person operation had been planned in 1968, but conflict with the trade unions delayed introduction until the 1980s.[53]
In the early years of the 21st century London Underground was reorganised in a Public-Private Partnership where private infrastructure companies (infracos) upgraded and maintained the railway. In 2003 control passed to Transport for London (TfL) that had been opposed to the arrangement.[54] One infraco went into administration in 2007 and TfL took over the responsibilities, TfL taking over the other in 2010.[55] Electronic ticketing in the form of the contact-less Oyster card was introduced in 2003.[56] The East London line closed in 2007 so that it could be converted into a London Overground line,[57][58] and in December 2009 the Circle line changed from serving a closed loop around the centre of London to a spiral also serving Hammersmith.[59]

Main article: Transport for London
Transport for London (TfL) was created in 2000 as the integrated body responsible for London's transport system. It replaced London Regional Transport. It assumed control of London Underground Limited in July 2003.[60] TfL is part of the Greater London Authority and is constituted as a statutory corporation regulated under local government finance rules.[61] It has three subsidiaries: London Transport Insurance (Guernsey) Ltd, TfL Trustee Company Ltd and Transport Trading Ltd (TTL), and London Underground Limited is a subsidiary of TTL.[62]
The TfL Board is appointed by the Mayor of London. The Mayor also sets the structure and level of public transport fares in London. However the day-to-day running of the corporation is left to the Commissioner of Transport for London. The current Commissioner is Peter Hendy.[63] The Mayor is responsible for producing an integrated transport strategy for London and for consulting the GLA, TfL, local councils and others on the strategy. The Mayor is also responsible for setting TfL's budget. The GLA is consulted on the Mayor's transport strategy, and inspects and approves the Mayor's budget. It is able to summon the Mayor and senior staff to account for TfL's performance. London TravelWatch, a body appointed by and reporting to the Assembly, deals with complaints about transport in London.[64]

Main article: London Underground infrastructure
The Underground serves 270 stations.[65] Fourteen Underground stations are outside Greater London, of which five (Amersham, Chalfont &amp; Latimer, Chesham, and Chorleywood on the Metropolitan line, and Epping on the Central line), are beyond the M25 London Orbital motorway. Of the 32 London boroughs, six (Bexley, Bromley, Croydon, Kingston, Lewisham and Sutton) are not served by the Underground network, while Hackney has Old Street and Manor House only just inside its boundaries.

London Underground's eleven lines total 250 miles (402 km) in length, making it the fourth longest metro system in the world. These are made up of the sub-surface network and the deep-tube lines.[66] The Circle, District, Hammersmith &amp; City, and Metropolitan lines form the sub-surface network, with railway tunnels just below the surface and of a similar size to those on British main lines. The Hammersmith &amp; City and Circle lines share stations and most of the track with other lines. The Bakerloo, Central, Jubilee, Northern, Piccadilly, Victoria and Waterloo &amp; City lines are deep-level tubes, with smaller trains that run in two circular tunnels (tubes) with a diameter about 11 feet 8 inches (3.56 m). These lines have the exclusive use of a pair of tracks, except for the Piccadilly line, which shares track with the District line between Acton Town and Hanger Lane Junction and with the Metropolitan line between Rayners Park and Uxbridge, and the Bakerloo line, which shares track with London Overground services north of Queen's Park.[67] Fifty-five per cent of the system runs on the surface, and there are 20 miles (32 km) of cut-and-cover tunnel and 93 miles (150 km) of tube tunnel.[66] Many of the central London underground stations on deep-level tube lines are higher than the running lines to assist deceleration when arriving and acceleration when departing.[68] Trains generally run on the left-hand track, although in some places the tunnels are above each other, for example the Central line east of St Paul's station, or the running tunnels are on the right, for example on the Victoria line between Warren Street and King's Cross St. Pancras to allow cross-platform interchange with the Northern line between northbound and southbound trains at Euston.[67][69]
The lines are electrified with a four-rail DC system: a conductor rail between the rails is energised at −210 V and a rail outside the running rails at +420 V, giving a potential difference of 630 V. On the sections of line shared with mainline trains, such as the District line from East Putney to Wimbledon and Gunnersbury to Richmond, and the Bakerloo line north of Queen's Park, the centre rail is bonded to the running rails.[70]

The Underground uses a number of railways and alignments that were built by main-line railway companies.
Bakerloo line: Between Queen's Park and Harrow &amp; Wealdstone this runs largely parallel to the London &amp; North Western Railway (LNWR) main line that opened in 1837. The Bakerloo line route has always been segregated, and was laid out by the LNWR in 1912–15.[78]
Central line: The railway from just south of Leyton to just south of Loughton was built by Eastern Counties Railway in 1856 on the same alignment in use today.[78] The Underground also uses the line built in 1865 by the Great Eastern Railway (GER) between Loughton to Ongar via Epping. The connection to the main line south of Leyton was closed in 1970 and removed in 1972. The line from Epping to Ongar was closed in 1994; most of the line is in use today by the heritage Epping Ongar Railway.[78] The line between Newbury Park and Woodford junction (west of Roding Valley) via Hainault was built by the GER in 1903, the connections to the main line south of Newbury Park closing in 1947 (in the Ilford direction) and 1956 (in the Seven Kings direction).[78]
Central line: The line from just north of White City to Ealing Broadway was built in 1917 by the Great Western Railway (GWR) and passenger service introduced by the Underground in 1920. North Acton to West Ruislip was built by GWR on behalf of the Underground in 1947–8 as parallel line to the pre-existing tracks from Old Oak Common junction towards High Wycombe and beyond, which date from 1904.[78] As of May 2013, the original Old Oak Common junction to South Ruislip route sees one main-line train a day to/from Paddington.[79]
District line: South of Kensington Olympia short sections of the 1862 West London Railway (WLR) and its 1863 West London Extension Railway (WLER) were used when District extended from Earl's Court in 1872. The District had its own bay platform at Olympia built in 1958 along with track on the bed of the 1862/3 WLR/WLER northbound. Southbound WLR/WLER became the new northbound main line at this time, and a new southbound main-line track was built through site of former goods yard. The 1872 junction closed in 1958, while a further connection to the WLR just south of Olympia closed in 1992, and the branch is now segregated.[78]
District line: The line between Campbell Road junction (now closed), near Bromley-by-Bow, and Barking was built by the London, Tilbury &amp; Southend Railway (LTSR) in 1858. The slow tracks were built 1903–05, when District services were extended from Bow Road (though there were no District services east of East Ham from 1905 to 1932). The slow tracks were shared with LTSR stopping and goods trains until segregated by 1962, when main-line trains stopped serving intermediate stations.[78]
District line: The railway from Barking to Upminster was built by LTSR in 1885 and the District extended over the route in 1902. District withdrew between 1905 and 1932, when the route was quadrupled. Main-line trains ceased serving intermediate stations in 1962, and the District line today only uses the 1932 slow tracks.[78]
District line: The westbound track between east of Ravenscourt Park and Turnham Green and Turnham Green to Gunnersbury follows the alignment of a railway built by the London &amp; South Western Railway (LSWR) in 1869. Eastbound track between Turnham Green and east of Ravenscourt Park follows the alignment built in 1911; this was closed 1916 before being re-used when the Piccadilly line was extended in 1932.[78]
District line: The line between East Putney and Wimbledon was built by the LSWR in 1889. The last regular main-line service ran in 1941[78] but it still sees a few Waterloo services at the start and end of the daily timetable.[80]
Hammersmith &amp; City: Between Paddington and Westbourne Park tube station, the line is parallel to the main line. The Great Western main line opened in 1836, serving a temporary terminus the other side of Bishop's Road and when the current Paddington station opened in 1854, the line passed to the south of the old station.[78] On opening in 1864 the Hammersmith &amp; City ran via the main line to a junction at Westbourne Park, until 1867 when two tracks opened to the south of the main line, with a crossing near Westbourne Bridge, Paddington. The current two tracks to the north of the main line and the subway east of Westbourne Park opened in 1878.[81]. The H &amp; C route is now completely segregated from the main line.
Jubilee line: Between Canning Town and Stratford was built the GER in 1846 with passenger services starting in 1847, making this the oldest railway in use as part of today's Underground system. The original alignment was quadrupled "in stages between 1860 and 1892" for freight services before being lifted as traffic declined during the 20th century and re-laid for Jubilee line services that started in 1999. The current Docklands Light Railway (ex-North London Line) uses the original eastern alignment and the Jubilee uses the western alignment.[78]
Northern line: The line from East Finchley to Mill Hill East was opened in 1867, and from Finchley Central to High Barnet in 1872, both by the Great Northern Railway.[78]
Piccadilly line: westbound track between east of Ravenscourt Park and Turnham Green built by LSWR in 1869, originally used for eastbound main-line and District services, eastbound track built in 1911 and closed 1916 and re-used when the Piccadilly line was extended in 1932.[78]

London Underground trains come in two sizes, larger sub-surface trains and smaller deep-tube trains.[82] Since the early 1960s all passenger trains have been electric multiple units with sliding doors[83] and a train last ran with a guard in 2000.[84] All lines use fixed length trains with between six and eight cars, except for the Waterloo &amp; City line that uses four cars.[85] New trains are designed for maximum number of standing passengers and for speed of access to the cars and have regenerative braking and public address systems.[86] Since 1999 all new stock has had to comply with accessibility regulations that require such things as access and room for wheelchairs, and the size and location of door controls. All underground trains are required to comply with the The Rail Vehicle Accessibility (Non Interoperable Rail System) Regulations 2010 (RVAR 2010) by 2020.[87]
Stock on sub-surface lines is identified by a letter (such as S Stock, used on the Metropolitan line), while tube stock is identified by the year of intended introduction[88] (for example, 1996 Stock, used on the Jubilee line).
See also: London Underground infrastructure: Ventilation and cooling
When the Bakerloo line opened in 1906 it was advertised with a maximum temperature of 16 °C (60 °F), but over time the tube tunnels have warmed up. In 1938 approval was given for a ventilation improvement programme, and a refrigerating unit was installed in a lift shaft at Tottenham Court Road.[89] More recently, temperatures of 47 °C (117 °F) were reported in the 2006 European heat wave.[90] It was pointed out in 2002 that, if animals were being transported, temperatures on the Tube would break European Commission animal welfare laws.[91] A 2003 study reported that air quality was seventy-three times worse than at street level, with twenty minutes on the Northern line having "the same effect as smoking a cigarette".[92] The main purpose of the London Underground's ventilation fans is to extract hot air from the tunnels,[89] and fans across the network are being refurbished, although complaints of noise from local residents preclude their use at full power at night.[93] In June 2006 a groundwater cooling system was installed at Victoria station.[94] In 2012 air-cooling units were installed on platforms at Green Park station using cool deep groundwater and at Oxford Circus using chiller units at the top of an adjacent building.[95] New air-conditioned trains are being introduced on the sub-surface lines, but space is limited on tube trains for air-conditioning units and these would heat the tunnels even more. The Deep Tube Programme, investigating replacing the trains for the Bakerloo and Piccadilly lines, is looking for trains with better energy conservation and regenerative braking, on which it might be possible to install a form of air-conditioning.[86][96]
See also: London Underground infrastructure: Lifts and escalators


Escalators at Canary Wharf station
Originally access to the deep-tube platforms was by a lift.[97] Each lift was manned, and at some quiet stations in the 1920s the ticket office was moved into the lift, or it was arranged that the lift could be controlled from the ticket office.[98] The first escalator on the London Underground was installed in 1911 between the District and Piccadilly platforms at Earl's Court and from the following year new deep-level stations were provided with escalators instead of lifts.[99] The escalators had a diagonal shunt at the top landing.[99][100] In 1921 a recorded voice instructed passengers to stand on the right and signs followed in World War II.[101] Travellers were asked to stand on the right so that anyone wishing to overtake them at the end would have an extra section of moving stairway.[102] The first 'comb' type escalator was installed in 1924 at Clapham Common.[99] In the 1920s and 1930s many lifts were replaced by escalators.[103]
There are 426 escalators on the London Underground system and the longest, at 60 metres (200 ft), is at Angel. The shortest, at Stratford, gives a vertical rise of 4.1 metres (13 ft). There are 164 lifts,[66] and numbers have increased in recent years due to a programme to increase accessibility.[104]
In the summer of 2012 London Underground, in partnership with Virgin Media, trialled Wi-Fi hot spots in many stations, but not in the tunnels, that allowed passengers free internet access. The free trial proved successful so it was extended to the end of 2012[105] whereupon it switched to a service, available to subscribers to Virgin Media and others, or as a paid-for service.[106] It is not currently possible to use mobile phones underground and a project to extend the network before the 2012 Olympics was abandoned due to commercial and technical difficulties.[107]

Crossrail is under construction and expected to open in 2018, providing a new underground route across central London integrated with, but not part of the London Underground system.[108][109] Two options are being considered for the route of Crossrail 2 on a north-south alignment across London, with hopes that it could be open by 2033.[110]
Main article: Croxley Rail Link
The Croxley Rail Link involves re-routing the Metropolitan line's Watford branch from the current terminus at Watford over the disused Croxley Green branch line to Watford Junction with stations at Ascot Road, Vicarage Road and Watford High Street. Funding was agreed in December 2011,[111] and the final approval for the extension was given on 24 July 2013.[112] Construction work is expected to start in June 2014 and end by January 2016.[113]
Main article: Northern line extension to Battersea
It is planned that the Northern line be extended to Battersea with an intermediate station at Nine Elms. In December 2012, the Treasury confirmed that it will provide a guarantee that allows the Greater London Authority to borrow up to £1 billion from the Public Works Loan Board, at a preferential rate, to finance the construction of the line.[114] In April 2013, Transport for London applied for the legal powers of a Transport and Works Act Order to proceed with the extension, with a decision expected in the summer of 2013[115] A public inquiry is possible from November 2013 to January 2014. The stations could open in 2020.[116]
Main article: Bakerloo line extension to Camberwell
In 1931 the extension of the Bakerloo line from Elephant &amp; Castle to Camberwell was approved, with stations at Albany Road and an interchange at Denmark Hill. However, with post-war austerity, the plan was abandoned. In 2006 Ken Livingstone, the then Mayor of London, announced that within twenty years Camberwell would have a tube station.[117] Transport for London has indicated that extensions, possibly to Camberwell, could play a part in the future transport strategy for South London over the coming years.[118] However, no such planning of an extension has been revealed. There have also been many other proposals to extend the line to Streatham, Lewisham, and even beyond Lewisham, taking over the suburban Hayes line via Catford Bridge to relieve some capacity on the suburban rail network.
The London Borough of Hillingdon has proposed that the Central line be extended from West Ruislip to Uxbridge via Ickenham, claiming this would cut traffic on the A40 in the area.[119]
The signalling system on the Northern line is being replaced to increase capacity on the line by 20 per cent by the end of 2014.[77] Capacity can be increased further if the operation of the Charing Cross and Bank branches are separated.[120] New S Stock trains are being introduced on the sub-surface (District, Metropolitan, Hammersmith &amp; City and Circle) lines, and the track, electrical supply and signalling systems are being upgraded in a programme planned to increase peak-hour capacity by the end of 2018.[77][96] A single control room for the sub-surface network is to be established in Hammersmith and an automatic train control (ATC) system will replace signalling equipment installed from the 1940s.[96][121] Options for new trains for the Bakerloo and Piccadilly lines are being considered.[77]



The Oyster card, a contactless smart card used across the London transport system
Main article: London Underground ticketing
The Underground uses Transport for London's zonal fare system to calculate fares. There are nine zones, zone 1 being the central zone, which includes the loop of the Circle line with a few stations to the south of River Thames. The only London Underground stations in Zones 7 to 9 are on the Metropolitan line beyond Moor Park, outside Greater London. Some stations are in two zones, and the cheapest fare applies.[122] Paper tickets or the contactless Oyster card can be used for travel. Single and return tickets are available in either format, but Travelcards (season tickets) for longer than a day are available only on Oyster cards.[123][124][125]
TfL introduced the Oyster card in 2003; this is a pre-payment smartcard with an embedded contactless RFID chip.[126] It can be loaded with Travelcards and used on the Underground, the Overground, buses, trams, the Docklands Light Railway, and National Rail services within London.[127] Fares for single journeys are cheaper than paper tickets, and a daily cap limits the total cost in a day to the price of a Day Travelcard.[128] The Oyster card must be 'touched in' at the start and end of a journey, otherwise it is regarded as 'incomplete' and the maximum fare charged.[129] In March 2012 the cost of this in the previous year to travellers was £66.5 million.[130] As of March 2013 contactless payment cards can be used instead of an Oyster card on buses, and it is planned to extend this to the Underground in late 2013.[131]
A concessionary fare scheme is operated by London Councils for residents who are disabled or meet certain age criteria.[132] Residents born before 1951 were eligible after their 60th birthday, whereas those born in 1955 will need to wait for they are 66.[133] Called a "Freedom Pass" it allows for free travel on TfL-operated routes at all times and is valid on some National Rail services within London at weekends and after 09:30 on Monday to Fridays.[134] Since 2010, the Freedom Pass has included an embedded holder's photograph; it lasts five years between renewals.[135]
In addition to automatic and staffed ticket gates, the Underground is patrolled by both uniformed and plain-clothes ticket inspectors with hand-held Oyster-card readers. Passengers travelling without a valid ticket must pay a penalty fare of £80 (or £40 if paid within 21 days) and can be prosecuted for fare evasion under the Regulation of Railways Act 1889 and Transport for London Byelaws.[136][137]
The tube closes overnight, the first trains running from about 05:00 to just after 01:00 the following morning, with later starting times at weekends.[138][139] The nightly closures are used for maintenance,[138] but some lines stay open at New Year[140] and close later during major public events such as the 2012 London Olympics.[141] London Underground have proposed extending opening times on some lines at the weekend after 2015, following upgrades to the lines.[139] Some lines are closed for scheduled engineering work at weekends to update the system.[142]
The Underground runs limited service on Christmas Eve with some lines closing early, and does not operate on Christmas Day.[140] Since 2010 a dispute between London Underground and trade unions over holiday pay has resulted in a limited service on Boxing Day.[143]


The gap between train and platform. "Mind the gap" signs and announcements have made at stations with curved platforms since 1926 and recorded messages have used since the late 1960s.[37]
Accessibility by people with limited mobility was not considered when most of the system was built, and before 1993 fire regulations prohibited wheelchairs on the underground. The stations on the Jubilee Line Extension, opened in 2000, were designed for accessibility, but retrofitting accessibility features to the older stations is a major investment that is planned to take over twenty years.[144] A 2010 London Assembly Report concluded that over ten per cent of the people of London had reduced mobility,[145] and with an ageing population numbers will increase in the future.[146]
TfL produces a version of the tube map that indicates stations that are step-free from street to platforms. There can also be a step from platform to train as large as 12 inches (300 mm) and a gap between the train and curved platforms, and these distances are marked on the map. Access from platform to train at some stations can be assisted using a boarding ramp operated by staff, and a section has been raised on some platforms to reduce the step.[147][148]
As of December 2012 there are 66 stations with step-free access from platform to train,[149] and there are plans to provide step-free access at another 28 in ten years.[150] By 2016 a third of stations are to have platform humps that reduce the step from platform to train.[151] New trains, such as those being introduced on the sub-surface network, have access and room for wheelchairs, improved audio and visual information systems and accessible door controls.[151][87]


Overcrowding is a regular problem for Tube passengers
During peak hours, stations can get so crowded they need to be closed. Passengers may not get on the first train[152] and the majority of passengers do not find a seat on their trains,[153] some trains having more than four passengers every square metre.[154] When asked, passengers report overcrowding as the aspect of the network that they are least satisfied with, and overcrowding has been linked to poor productivity and potential poor heart health.[155] Capacity increases have been overtaken by increased demand, and peak overcrowding has increased by 16 per cent since 2004/5.[156]
Compared with 2003/4, the reliability of the network had increased in 2010/11, with Lost Customer Hours reduced from 54 million to 40 million.[157] Passengers are entitled to a refund if their journey is delayed by 15 minutes or more due to circumstances within the control of TfL,[158] and in 2010, 330,000 passengers of a potential 11 million Tube passengers claimed compensation for delays.[159] A number of mobile phone apps and services have been developed to help passengers claim their refund more efficiently.[160]

London Underground is authorised to operate trains by the Office of Rail Regulation, and the latest Safety Certification and Safety Authorisation is valid until 2017.[161] On 19 March 2013 there had been 310 days since the last major incident,[162] when a passenger had died after falling on the track.[163]
In November 2011 it was reported that 80 people had committed suicide in the previous year on the London Underground, up from 46 in 2000.[164] Most platforms at deep tube stations have pits, often referred to as 'suicide pits', beneath the track. These were constructed in 1926 to aid drainage of water from the platforms, but halve the likelihood of a fatality when a passenger falls or jumps in front of a train.[165][166][167]



The left side shows the 1933 Beck map and the right side the map as it appeared in 2012
Main article: Tube map
Early maps of the Metropolitan and District railways were city maps with the lines superimposed,[168] and the District published a pocket map in 1897.[169] A Central London Railway route diagram appears on a 1904 postcard and 1905 poster,[170] similar maps appearing in District Railway cars in 1908.[171] In the same year, following a marketing agreement between the operators, a joint central area map that included all the lines was published.[172][173] A new map was published in 1921 without any background details, but the central area was squashed, requiring smaller letters and arrows.[174] Harry Beck had the idea of expanding this central area, distorting geography, and simplifying the map so that the railways appeared as straight lines with equally spaced stations. He presented his original draft in 1931, and after initial rejection it was first printed in 1933. Today's tube map is an evolution of that original design, and the ideas are used by many metro systems around the world.[175][176]
Currently the standard tube map shows the Docklands Light Railway, London Overground and Emirates Air Line as well as the London Underground;[177] a more detailed map covering a larger area, published by National Rail and Transport for London, includes London Tramlink and suburban railway services.[178] The tube map came second in a BBC and London Transport Museum poll asking for a favourite UK design icon of the 20th century[179] and the underground's 150th anniversary was celebrated by a Google Doodle on the search engine.[180][181]


An early form of the roundel at Ealing Broadway
While the first use of a roundel in a London transport context was the trademark of the London General Omnibus Company registered in 1905, it was first used on the Underground in 1908 when the UERL placed a solid red circle behind station nameboards on platforms to highlight the name.[182][183] The word "UNDERGROUND" was placed in a roundel instead of a station name on posters in 1912 by Charles Sharland and Alfred France, as well as on undated and possibly earlier posters from the same period.[184] Frank Pick thought the solid red disc cumbersome and took a version where the disc became a ring from a 1915 Sharland poster and give it to Edward Johnston to develop, and registered the symbol as a trademark in 1917.[185] The roundel was first printed on a map cover using the Johnston typeface in June 1919, and printed in colour the following October.[186]
After the UERL was absorbed into the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933, it used forms of the roundel for buses, trams and coaches, as well as the Underground. The words "London Transport" were added inside the ring, above and below the bar. The Carr-Edwards report, published in 1938 as possibly the first attempt at a graphics standards manual, introduced stricter guidelines.[187] Between 1948 and 1957 the word "Underground" in the bar was replaced by "London Transport".[188] As of 2013, forms of the roundel, with differing colours for the ring and bar, is used for other TfL services, such as London Buses, Tramlink, London Overground, London River Services and Docklands Light Railway.[189] Crossrail, due to open in 2018, is to be identified with a roundel.[190] The 100th anniversary of the roundel was celebrated in 2008 by TfL commissioning 100 artists to produce works that celebrate the design.[191]
See also: List of listed London Underground stations
Seventy of the 270 London Underground stations use buildings that are on the Statutory List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest, and five have entrances in listed buildings.[192] The Metropolitan Railway's original seven stations were inspired by Italianate designs, with the platforms lit by daylight from above and by gas lights in large glass globes.[193] Early District Railway stations were similar and on both railways the further from central London the station the simpler the construction.[194] The City &amp; South London Railway opened with red-brick buildings, designed by Thomas Phillips Figgis, topped with a lead-covered dome that contained the lift mechanism.[195] The Central London Railway appointed Harry Bell Measures as architect, who designed its pinkish-brown steel-framed buildings with larger entrances.[196]


Russell Square, one of the UERL stations designed by Leslie Green clad in ox-blood tiles
In the first decade of the 20th century Leslie Green established a house style for the tube stations built by the UERL, which were clad in ox-blood faience blocks.[197] Green pioneered using building design to guide passengers with direction signs on tiled walls, with the stations given a unique identity with patterns on the platform walls.[198][199] Many of these tile patterns survive, though a significant number of these are now replicas.[200] Harry W. Ford was responsible for the design of at least 17 UERL and District Railway stations, including Barons Court and Embankment, and claimed to have first thought of enlarging the U and D in the UNDERGROUND wordmark.[201] The Met's architect Charles Walter Clark had used a neo-classical design for rebuilding Baker Street and Paddington Praed Street stations before World War I and, although the fashion had changed, continued with Farringdon in 1923. The buildings had metal lettering attached to pale walls.[196] Clark would later design "Chiltern Court", the large, luxurious block of apartments at Baker Street, that opened in 1929.[202] In the 1920s and 1930s, Charles Holden designed a series of modernist and art-deco stations some of which he described as his 'brick boxes with concrete lids'.[203] Holden's design for the Underground's headquarters building at 55 Broadway included avant-garde sculptures by Jacob Epstein, Eric Gill and Henry Moore.[204][205]
When the Central line was extended east, the stations were simplified Holden proto-Brutalist designs,[206] and a cavernous concourse built at Gants Hill in honour of early Moscow Metro stations.[207] Misha Black was appointed design consultant for the 1960s Victoria line, contributing to the line's uniform look,[208] but each station had an individual tile motif.[209] The stations of the 1990s extension of the Jubilee line were much larger than before[210] and designed by architects such as Norman Foster and Michael Hopkins.[211]
Many platforms have unique interior designs to help passenger identification. The tiling at Baker Street incorporates repetitions of Sherlock Holmes's silhouette[212] and at Tottenham Court Road semi-abstract mosaics by Eduardo Paolozzi feature musical instruments, tape machines and butterflies.[213] Robyn Denny designed the murals on the Northern line platforms at Embankment.[212]
Main article: Johnston (typeface)
The first posters used a number of type fonts, as was contemporary practice,[214] and station signs used sans serif block capitals.[215] The Johnson typeface was developed in upper and lower case in 1916, and a complete set of blocks, marked Johnson Sans, was made by the printers the following year.[216] A bold version of the capitals was developed by Johnson in 1929.[217] The Met changed to a serif letterform for its signs in the 1920s, used on the stations rebuilt by Clark.[218] However, Johnson was adopted systemwide after the formation the LPTB in 1933 and the LT wordmark was applied to locomotives and carriages.[219] Johnson was redesigned, becoming New Johnson, for photo-typesetting in the early 1980s when Elichi Kono designed a range that included Light, Medium and Bold, each with its italic version. The typesetters P22 developed today's electronic version, sometimes called TfL Johnson, in 1997.[220]


1913 Underground poster by Tony Sarg
Early advertising posters proclaimed the advantages of travelling using various letter forms.[221] Graphic posters first appeared in the 1890s,[222] and it became possible to print colour images economically in the early 20th century.[223] The Central London Railway used colour illustrations in their 1905 poster,[224] and from 1908 the underground group, under Pick's direction, used images of country scenes, shopping and major events on posters to encourage use of the tube.[225] Pick found he was limited by the commercial artists the printers used, and so commissioned work from artists such as Edward McKnight Kauffer, Graham Sutherland,[222] Charles Sharland and the cartoonist George Morrow. The Johnson Sans letter form began appearing on posters from 1917.[226] The Met, strongly independent, used images on timetables and on the cover of its Metro-land guide that promoted the country it served for the walker, visitor and later the house-hunter.[227][228] By the London Transport was formed in 1933 the UERL was considered a patron of the arts[222] and over 1000 works were commissioned in the 1930s, such as the cartoon images of Charles Burton and Kauffer's later abstract cubist and surrealist images.[229]
Harold Hutchison became London Transport publicity officer in 1947, after World War II and nationalisation, and introduced the "pair poster", where an image on a poster was paired with text on another. Numbers of commissions dropped, to eight a year in the 1950s and just four a year in the 1970s,[222] with images from artists such Harry Stevens and Tom Eckersley.[230] Art on the Underground was introduced in 1986 by Henry Fitzhugh to revive London Transport as a patron of the arts with the Underground commissioning six works a year,[222] judged first on artistic merit. In that year Peter Lee, Celia Lyttleton and a poster by David Booth, Malcolm Fowler and Nancy Fowler were commissioned.[231] Today commissions range from the pocket tube map cover to installations in a station.[232] Similarly, Poems on the Underground has commissioned poetry since 1986 that are displayed in carriages.[233]
Main article: London Underground in popular culture
The Underground (including several fictitious stations[234]) has been featured in many movies and television shows, including Skyfall, Die Another Day, Sliding Doors, An American Werewolf in London, Creep, Tube Tales and Neverwhere. The London Underground Film Office received over 200 requests to film in 2000.[235] The Underground has also featured in music such as The Jam's "Down in the Tube Station at Midnight" and in literature such as the graphic novel V for Vendetta. Popular legends about the Underground being haunted persist to this day.[236]
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 has a level named Underground where most of the level takes place between the dockyards and Westminster while the player and a team of SAS attempt to take down cargo being shipped using London Underground. The London Underground map serves as a playing field for the conceptual game of Mornington Crescent (which is named after a station on the Northern Line) and the board game The London Game.

Charles Pearson (1793–1862) suggested an underground railway in London in 1845 and from 1854 promoted a scheme that eventually became the Metropolitan Railway.[237]
John Fowler (1817–1898) was the railway engineer that designed the Metropolitan Railway.[238]
Edward Watkin (1819–1901) was chairman of the Metropolitan Railway from 1872 to 1894.[239]
James Henry Greathead (1844–1896) was the engineer that dug the Tower Subway using a method using a wrought iron shield patented by Peter W. Barlow, and later used the same tunnelling shield to build the deep-tube London &amp; South London and Central London railways.[240][241]
Charles Yerkes (1837–1905) was an American who founded the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) in 1902, which opened three tube lines and electrified the District Railway.[242][243]
Edgar Speyer (1862–1932) Financial backer of Yerkes who served as UERL chairman from 1906 to 1915 during its formative years.[244]
Albert Stanley (1874–1948) was manager of the UERL from 1907, and became the first chairman of the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) in 1933.[245]
Frank Pick (1878–1941) was UERL publicity officer from 1908, commercial manager from 1912 and joint managing director from 1928. He was chief executive and vice chairman of the LPTB from 1933 to 1940. It was Pick that commissioned Edward Johnson to create the typeface and redesign the roundel, and established the Underground's reputation as patrons of the arts as users of the best in contemporary poster art and architecture.[246]
Robert Selbie (1868–1930) was manager of the Metropolitan Railway from 1908 until his death, marketing it using the Metro-land brand.[247][248]
Edward Johnston (1872–1944) developed the Johnson Sans typeface, still in use today on the London Underground.[247]
Harry Beck (1902–1974) designed the tube map, named in 2006 as a British design icon.[249]

            <Text>They settled into another vast space with a ceiling high enough to have allowed the Penny Dreadful to float around the room with ample space. The room was supported by marble columns and decorated with ancient greek statues that looked like they belonged in a museum. Continuing along the lines of the theme of the rest of the house, the series of statues depicted Hades binding Persephone to the underworld, Persephone raising a piece of pomegranate to her lips while Hades looked on eagerly; Hades dragging his wife down into the underworld. The statues were towering, each one’s head high enough to look down from the top of the spiral staircase, which led to the second story.
Jonathan had taken up a seat on the chaise longue, while Sinews chose a chair in an ornate French style. The chair hardly looked comfortable, but it was remarkably stylish, with brocade upholstery. As they settled in to converse, Henry Charles Ocelot lit a cigarette for Sinews, who smoked using a long smoking stick, blowing perfect rings of smoke that drifted up and dissolved.
“Cigarette?” Mr. Ocelot offered Jonathan.
Jonathan declined, instead choosing to fish one out of his own pockets. He allowed Mr. Ocelot to light it, and drew on the cigarette with pleasure.
It was only because of Roderick’s acquaintanceship with Sinews that Jonathan trusted the man at all. His own instincts told him Sinews was not to be trusted. But Jonathan trusted Roderick, and Roderick had sent him here. He forced himself to sit still.
“Tea?” asked Sinews. “On second thought, are you an absinthe drinker, Mr. O?”
At this, Jonathan looked up eagerly. This time, when he wanted to decline, his words just didn’t come out right. “I could use a glass,” he said impulsively, regretting it the moment the words were out of his mouth.
“Excellent,” said Mr. Sinews. “Henry Charles, if you would?”
The large Haitian nodded and disappeared into the adjacent room, returning a few moments later with the green liquor and the accompanying accessories on a rolling cart. Setting his cigarette stick into a holder, Sinews joined Jonathan in preparing his glass, pouring just a trickle of water into his glass. The drink louched beautifully, remaining a strong green even as the sugar water dissolved into the glass, releasing an intoxicating smell into the air.
“Have you had visions, Mr. O?” said Sinews, referring to the drink’s reputation as a hallucinogen.
Having Roderick Steen for a friend, Jonathan had absorbed a fair bit of trivial knowledge over the years. “Our mutual friend, Mr. Steen tells me that that aspect of absinthe is a myth. Absinthe is no more hallucinogenic than any other liquor.”
“Then our friend has been drinking the wrong absinthe,” Sinews told him. “Speaking of Mr. Steen, what did he tell you about the nature of our relationship?”
Jonathan didn’t know what to make of this question. “I understand you consulted on the Resurrectionist case?”
To Jonathan’s surprise, this response elicited a laugh from Mr. Sinews. “True, I suppose, but that’s not how he and I know each other.”
Mr. Sinews sat back, pontarlier glass in one hand, cigarette stick in the other. He gave Jonathan a meaningful look, and Jonathan considered the man’s good looks, his gracefulness, and his friend’s taste for such things. He shifted uncomfortably in his seat.
“I see,” said Jonathan.
“It’s been a while since I’ve seen our mutual friend. You and he aren’t…” Mr. Sinews began.
Jonathan spluttered, almost spilling his drink. “Me and Roderick? No,” he said, “God, no. Roderick and I have simply been friends a long time. That’s all. Not that I take issue with Roderick’s inclinations.”
Mr. Sinews sipped his drink thoughtfully. Finally, he set his glass down.
“So, you want to know about the Resurrectionists?” he said, changing the subject. “Forgive me if I dredge up details with which you are already familiar. This will go more smoothly if I make the assumption of your ignorance…”
A fair assumption, thought Jonathan.
“A few years ago, a small, unassuming brick building in Whitechapel was home to a gentleman’s club. It was unmarked, aside from a small symbol painted on the back door. A crow. It was known as the Murder Club—murder, as in a murder of crows. The club’s windows were blackened, its list of members a closely guarded secret. Occasionally, witnesses were supposed to have seen gentlemen coming and going from the club’s rear entrance, but they wore masks whenever they visited the club.”
“Plague doctor’s masks,” Jonathan guessed.
“Just so,” Sinews told him. “The club’s members were prominent scientists, so it is understandable that they wished to keep their association with the Murder Club a secret. After all, the club’s scientific pursuits often blurred the lines of ethics, law, and even physics. As you likely know, some of their studies were published. They used pen names to hide their identities. The club’s member roster therefore reads like the cast of a penny dreadful. Spring-heeled Jack. Francis Varney. Sweeney Todd. The most famous of the Resurrectionists used the appellation Anthony Tidkins.”
“The Resurrection Man,” said Jonathan.
Sinews’ knowledge far exceeded Jonathan’s own, but Jonathan was not entirely ignorant on the subject. After all, his father had covered the story extensively in each of his newspapers; even the society papers had made mention of the Resurrection Man’s horrific murders. And of course, he was friends with Roderick, who had helped the police with their investigation into the Resurrection Man.
“The truth of the Resurrection Man’s origins is widely disputed,” Sinews went on. Once more, he paused to take a drag of his cigarette, inhaling with pleasure and puffing out a tight ring of smoke. “Tell me, Mr. O, what do you know about zombies?” he asked.
Jonathan shook his head. He wasn’t familiar with the word.
“There were stories of men being raised from the dead by bokors—vodou priests reputed to have the god-given power to perform miracles. Like Jesus raising Lazarus, these priests claimed to be able to raise the dead. There were some stories of men who, having succumbed to some sudden illness or another, were buried, only to be seen weeks later working on a farm with no recollection of their former lives. The word zombie was given to these resurrected men.”
“And what does this have to do with Anthony Tidkins?” Jonathan asked.
Sinews grinned. “Everything,” he said. “A number of scientists, having heard of these so-called zombies, visited Haiti to investigate. Most of them reported that the supposedly resurrected men hadn’t been dead at all. You see, the bokors were deceiving people to earn free labourers and gain fear and respect from the other villagers. In each case, the zombie had been poisoned with what turned out to be some compound derived mostly from some toxins found in pufferfish. This poison rendered the men temporarily paralyzed and gave them a death-like pallor. After the man was pronounced dead and buried, the fraudulent bokor would dig up the body, and the man would gradually regain consciousness, but not without damage to his mind and memory. These zombies were the ideal labourers, their brains slow and susceptible to suggestion. They had no memories of their former lives, so they believed they had no home to go back to. They were therefore entirely amenable to labouring on the bokor’s farm, or being sold into slavery to the profit of the bokor. I mentioned earlier that this is what the scientists reported in most cases. There was, however, one scientist who found something different.”
“Anthony Tidkins?” Jonathan guessed.
“Indeed,” said Sinews. “Anthony Tidkins believed he had discovered another version of these zombies, their condition brought about not by some pufferfish toxin, but by a disease. He made it his life’s work, studying these zombies and their strange affliction. Eventually, he returned to London and began to publish some of his findings, naming the affliction the Lazarus Virus and aiming to replicate it. At first, he was ridiculed by the scientific community. Then, he was invited to join the Murder Club, where he found support for his ideas. He published a few more papers, which were again shut down by critics as ridiculous. Apparently, he decided he could prove them wrong. Thus began his series of experiments.”
“The murders, you mean,” said Jonathan.
Sinews nodded. “He believed he could only revive a freshly killed subject.”
“But he failed, ultimately, didn’t he?” asked Jonathan. “His subjects didn’t actually come back to life?”
“Nevertheless, Tidkins remained convinced he could raise the dead, so he kept on trying. Do you know how our mutual friend connected the murderer to the Resurrectionists?” asked Sinews, swallowing the last of his absinthe.
Jonathan shook his head. Roderick had earned some amount of fame for his revelation. Naming Anthony Tidkins, the Resurrection Man as the murderer—even if they had only a pseudonym to go on—had been the biggest breakthrough in the case so far, and it had forced the Resurrectionists to shut down the old Murder Club that Sinews had mentioned, and to go deeper underground. Since then, the murders had stopped, and the Resurrectionists hadn’t been heard from since—until Lord Connor’s masquerade, of course.
But while Jonathan knew of Roderick’s breakthrough, he never knew how Roderick had made the connection. Jonathan was beginning to see why Roderick had sent him here; as promised, Sinews was proving to be extremely knowledgeable when it came to the Resurrectionists.
“It was a simple thing, as it turned out. Tidkins’ experiments were funded by our own military. His name—well, his pseudonym—was signed to his grant application. Mr. Steen had the brilliant idea to go through grant and patent applications for any signs of the Resurrectionists; after all, they were scientists, and experimentation can be quite expensive. It stood to reason that they might have applied for sponsorship. The experiments described in the grant application were not so different from the murders, which in turn aligned with Tidkins’ accounts of the zombification process described in his published papers. Of course, the approved grant application stipulated that Tidkins was meant to have used willing participants.”
Jonathan looked at Sinews in surprise. “Willing participants? Who would consent to such experimentation?”
“Exactly!” Sinews exclaimed, tapping out his cigarette into an ash tray. “You’re asking all the right questions. Yes, who indeed? And of course, if the Resurrection Man’s experiments lacked scientific basis, why would he have received funding?”
“You believe there was some actual credibility to his claims?” Jonathan asked, smothering his own cigarette butt in the ash tray.
“The military certainly believed so,” Sinews answered dismissively. “And imagine how our army might benefit from Tidkins’ work, if his experiments proved fruitful. If the British military could raise the dead, we would be undefeatable. Not only that, but we could wage wars without needing to risk even a single life. Even so, the experiments would not have been sanctioned without evidence to suggest Tidkins might actually be successful.”
This was all news to Jonathan. It was unsettling to know that the military had actually approved of Tidkins’ work. Of course, they couldn’t have known just how Tidkins had planned to conduct his experiments. Could they? Was it possible that the military had been turning a blind eye to his murders, so long as he wasn’t caught? After all, they must have known he would never have been able to find willing participants to his brutal experiments.
Lighting a new cigarette, Sinews continued his explanation. 
“Tidkins had an assistant, a man to bring him subjects, an Irish Giant, who stood at over eight feet tall according to the penny bloods. They called him Mr. Hyde. He would bring Tidkins fresh bodies, and Tidkins would conduct his experiments in a vain attempt to bring them back to life. Eventually, the body count began to stack up. Hundreds of subjects died to the Resurrection Man’s experiments. Quickly, the military cut off his funding, and when Tidkins name came to light thanks to Mr. Steen’s efforts, the military denied any knowledge of Tidkins’ experiments. Given their association with Tidkins, the Resurrectionists either went deep into hiding or disbanded altogether. At any rate, they haven’t been seen since.”
Jonathan thought of Lord Connor, and the scrap of paper he’d found in his father’s fireplace. Lord Connor is Francis Varney? Jonathan considered, briefly, showing it Sinews, but decided against it. He still didn’t trust the man.
“Until tonight,” Jonathan said.
“What do you mean?” demanded Sinews. For the first time, Sinews seemed rattled.
“I had reason to believe that Lord Connor was a Resurrectionist. He used the alias Francis Varney,” Jonathan told him, leaving out how he’d made that discovery. “I was writing a paper—”
“For your father’s journal,” Sinews said, cutting him off.
“My father?” Jonathan stammered.
“Yes. Charles Grimmer,” Sinews said, his tone suddenly altered. “I know who you are, Jonathan.”
Jonathan stared at him in alarm. How in the hell did he know that? Roderick had written Mr. O on the card. Jonathan was unsettled. He almost got out of his seat, but tried to keep his composure. But suddenly he realized what a fool he had been. Sinews’ knowledge of the Resurrectionists was beyond extensive, his home showed a deviant interest in death and resurrection—Hades, the orouboros, Anubis and Osiris—and his acquaintanceship with the frightful Haitian, Henry Charles Ocelot. He looked at Mr. Ocelot and couldn’t help but think of Sinews’ description of vodou priests. His hand drifted to the pistol at his belt, hidden beneath his vest.
“My father died,” he said coldly. “In a tragic accident.”
“An accident?” asked Sinews, meaningfully.
“What does that mean?”
“Your father had made a study of the Resurrectionists; after all, the Resurrection Man must have sold a lot of newspapers. He could probably have been considered an expert, don’t you think? Then suddenly, he turns up dead. And now, you come here saying they have surfaced again.”
“You think the Resurrectionists had something to do with my father’s death?”
“Perhaps your father learned something about them that they didn’t want to come to light. Now, tell me, what did you mean when you said they had resurfaced?”
Jonathan hesitated.
“I know what you’re thinking,” said Sinews, “But I assure you, I am not the Resurrection Man. Look around you, Mr. Grimmer. If I were the Resurrection Man, do you think I would have had to apply for funding from the military?”
Jonathan shook his head. No, of course not. He didn’t say so aloud, nor did he let his guard down. Perhaps Sinews was not Anthony Tidkins. That didn’t mean he was not a Resurrectionist. It certainly didn’t mean Jonathan had to trust him.
“Lord Connor died last night in his own home. He was sick. He attacked someone, and wound up shot dead. But the Resurrectionists were there.”
Sinews stood up, looking pale.
“Did you see them?” Mr. Sinews demanded in a tone of startling urgency.
Jonathan nodded. “I did. In fact, I believe I met one of them, a man called Solomon Grundy.”
“Born on a Monday,” Sinews muttered.
“Beg your pardon?”
“It’s a nursery rhyme,” Sinews explained. “Solomon Grundy, born on a Monday, christened on Tuesday, married on Wednesday, took ill on Thursday, grew worse on Friday, died on Saturday, buried on Sunday. That was the end of Solomon Grundy.”
“I thought the Resurrectionists took their names from penny dreadfuls?”
“There was a penny story based on the rhyme. I’m sorry, Mr. Grimmer, but if the Resurrectionists were at Connor’s last night, I need to check up on somebody. My fiancée attended Connor’s ball last night.”
Jonathan stood up too, surprised by this development for a number of reasons. First, because he was suddenly less convinced that Sinews was a Resurrectionist. His concern seemed legitimate, which meant that he couldn’t have known the Resurrectionists had been at Connor’s. Second, because Sinews hardly seemed the marrying type. He ventured to say so.
“Your fiancée?” he said simply.
Apparently taking no offence, Sinews answered with good humour, though he was still clearly troubled by Jonathan’s news. “Love changes a man. Unfortunately, I have succumbed to its effects.”
“Unfortunately?” Jonathan repeated.
“I’m all for romance,” Sinews told him, even as he strode through his hall towards his coat room, Henry Charles Ocelot and Jonathan in his wake. “But I am firmly against love. Love makes moths of us all. We are all drawn to its flames.”
A curious outlook. They passed through the opium den where the drug users looked up expectantly at Mr. Sinews, who swept past them, paying them no attention. Jonathan felt a pang of guilt as he walked past, keeping pace with Sinews, who paused in the next room.
“You think your fiancée may be in danger, simply because the Resurrectionists were there? Are they all as dangerous as Anthony Tidkins?”
Sinews shook his head. “They weren’t always. At one point, they were nothing more than a gentleman’s club with an interest in science. But since Tidkins joined them, their interests began to align with his, their own pursuits forgotten in favour of bringing the dead back to life. They called their endeavour the Dead London Project. They believed they needed more test subjects in order to test Tidkins’ theories. They seemed to believe that if they could find a way to distribute the Lazarus Virus throughout London, with over a million people in this city, they might at last be able to bring the dead to life. After Mr. Steen outed Tidkins as a Resurrectionist, I believed they had given up. It seems I was wrong; they hadn’t given up. They were merely hiding. If they’ve made a public return, it can only mean one thing.”
“And what’s that?” Jonathan asked.
Without his usual sardonic smile, without any hint of humour, Sinews replied. “They mean to begin the Dead London Project.”
He turned to Mr. Ocelot, as Jonathan gaped at him in stunned silence.
“If you could show Mr. Grimmer the door?” said Sinews, turning and heading down another hallway. “Good night, Mr. Grimmer. It has been a pleasure.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene 79</Title>
            <Synopsis>Anthony Tidkins is dead, but the scientists have activated an emergency protocol, releasing the zombies as a distraction while they escape, leaving Annabel, Roderick, and Palmer to deal with the zombies.</Synopsis>
            <Text>It was the death of a single patient that had caused Jack to shut down his medical practice. The countless lives he saved over the years meant nothing to him, not when weighed against that one death. He’d packed up his things, returned to London, and absorbed himself in a new pursuit with the same excess with which he’d studied medicine. Mechanical Engineering. He’d proven equally adept at that trade, and it was still his profession when Annabel first met him. A tinkerer and inventor, he used to build the most unimaginable devices, life-altering mechanical machines. Like Annabel’s clockwork eye.
His eyes widened as Annabel raised the pistol, and without another word, without another thought, she put a bullet in his skull.
She gasped with relief and regret and anguish as his blood spattered across her cheek, hot and wet. It seemed to sting as it struck her skin.
Abraham gasped in surprise, but Annabel’s attention was focused on Jack’s body. His eyes and mouth wide with surprise, a gaping hole through his left cheek, his body lay still on the floor.
Annabel’s knees threatened to buckle, and tears formed in her eye, but she kept herself upright. Finally, she returned her attention to Mr. Palmer.
“Let me up,” he was saying, as Annabel recovered her nerves and steadied herself. “You’ve got to let me up.”
He was gesturing towards something off in the distance. She blinked the tears from her eyes and looked. The zombies were staggering down the hall towards them.
She cursed. Wiping the blood from her face, she let Abraham up.
“If it comes down to it, I won’t hesitate to shoot you,” she warned him.
He got to his feet, a little worse for wear. He rubbed his injured jaw.
Meanwhile, Annabel stooped over, pulled the collar of Jack’s shirt aside. She pulled his cravat out of the way and examined his skin. The red pock-marks that Abraham had pointed out on Dr. Simms were not present on Jack’s pale skin. Of course not. He’d designed the serum himself. Why would he be dosed? Yet there was still some part of her that had believed he wasn’t capable of such an act of evil. Wasn’t it possible that Dr. Allen had been the mastermind behind Dead London, and that he’d brainwashed Jack?
But no, here was proof that everything Jack had done, he’d done of his own free will. Jack was responsible for London’s fate.
She tore herself away from the body on the ground. There was no time to mourn or to think about what she had done. The zombies were coming, and they were surprisingly fast for walking corpses, converging upon them from both directions. There was not nearly enough ammunition to deal with all of them.
“Where did they come from?” she exclaimed.
She tried the door to the Beta Laboratory, but it had been locked behind them. She banged on the door. She cursed as she scanned the hallway for another door. There wasn’t one, at least not between them and the zombies, and it would take too long to pick the lock.
“We’ll have to make a stand,” Abraham told her.
“I don’t like our odds,” she said, banging on the door again.
When no one answered it, she raised the pistol. There was nothing else for it but to put as many bullets in their skulls as they could, and then fight their way out with their bare hands.
Annabel closed her eye, relying on the prosthesis for her vision, squeezed the trigger, and one of them fell to the floor. He disappeared under the sea of zombies who climbed over him without seeming to slow.
She aimed and fired again with deadly accuracy, moved the revolver half an inch to the left, pulled the trigger again. Without pause, she fired into their midst, one bullet at a time. Each bullet hit its mark, but it was not enough. They continued to advance, their numbers practically unaffected by the onslaught of bullets.
“There’s too many of them,” she told Abraham.
“Just keep shooting,” he shouted back. They were inches away from each other, but the sounds of gunfire ricocheting down the hallway and the carnivorous moans of the zombies were deafening.
Abraham grunted, kicking at the doorknob to the laboratory with all his might. If they couldn’t pick the lock, maybe he could break it down. It was up to Annabel to buy him enough time.
She aimed again, pulled the trigger, and fired her last bullet. She hadn’t been counting, and only realised she was out when she fired again and heard the hollow click of an empty chamber.
She stuffed the gun back into her holster, and looked to Abraham. The latch still hadn’t broken. The zombies were almost upon them. Annabel marched forward, towards the creatures.
“What are you doing?” Abraham grunted.
“Just get that damned door open,” she shouted back.
She grabbed the first of them by the face, careful not to let his jaws seize upon her hands, and slammed his face into the wall. His skull cracked, and he fell to the floor. She stomped on his head for good measure, and caved in the next man’s face with a wicked right hook, all in one swift motion.
Already, another creature was grabbing at her, this time from behind. She grabbed his arms as if to fling him over her back, using his momentum against him, but his body was rotten, and his arms popped out of their sockets with a nasty plop, the skin and meat ripping from his rotting limbs like a snake sloughing off its skin. Annabel dropped one of the arms, but held onto the other.
She whirled around to face him, and recognised him. This was the creature from the tank. He was not merely rotten, but wet, soggy even. No wonder his arms had ripped out so easily. She raised his limb and swung it at his skull, using it to bludgeon him to death.
Even as she continued to fight, heart pounding as she kicked at the nearest walking cadaver, she registered a thought. Someone must have let these creatures out, deliberately.
At last, she heard Abraham’s voice, rising above the din.
“It’s open!”
She hurried to the door, ripping out the trachea of the nearest zombie fiend that assailed her in order to disengage from the fight. She landed a devastating blow with her right hand that knocked his head clean off. Still, she fought her way through the crowd, as they moved clumsily to sink their teeth into her flesh, until she found the open doorway and practically fell through it.
Remarkably, she was unscathed. She heaved, struggling against her corset for breath, as Abraham launched himself bodily at the door. It slammed, not quite shut, for several cadaverous limbs were caught in the door, their fingers still grasping for living flesh. Abraham strained against it, and it thudded inward, threatening to cave beneath the combined weight of the zombies on the other side.
The scientists looked alarmed, but did not intervene as Annabel hurried to help. She set herself against the door, but even the two of them could not hold it closed for long.
“A knife!” Annabel shouted at the alarmed boffins. “Or something sharp. Do you have one?”
Stunned into inaction, they simply stared at her in silence.
“Now!” she bellowed.
At last, Dr. Simms seemed to grasp, if not the situation, then at least that they were in danger. He hurried to find a tool from off the shelf, something sharp. Finally, he presented her with a long, jagged knife of surgical steel.
“Will this do, Doctor?” he asked.
She grabbed the knife, and whistled appreciatively. Who cared if he thought she was a doctor, so long as he kept the weapons coming.
She hesitated, looking at Abraham as she assessed the situation.
“Another one, for Mr. Palmer, if you have one?” she said finally.
Then, leaving Mr. Palmer to keep the door shut, she positioned herself with knife raised, at the edge of the door. He would have to make due with a scalpel, as that was what the addled-minded doctor had given him, but he gave Annabel a nod. When she returned the gesture, he stepped back from the doorway, and readied his scalpel.</Text>

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>There was a moment or two when Mr. Sinews continued not slipping through the slot in Faria’s door but instead using the opportunity of having escaped his cell to pursue an escape on a grander scale.
“What’s to stop me from leaving this prison altogether?” he whispered to the priest.
“Well,” said the the priest, heading to the door of his own cell, where Mr. Sinews stood, looking in. “You’ve done it,” he said, “That was neatly done.”
“I said—”
“I heard you,” said the priest. “Having had but a taste of freedom, now you want the world. Well, I can’t say I blame you. I’d like nothing more than to rush out the door myself. But I would advise you against that sort of recklessness. You are young, Mr. Sinews. You will have your freedom. But it will take time, and planning, and cunning. I think you’ll see what I mean when you have looked outside the window and seen what sort of prison this truly is.”
Mr. Sinews listened to the priest’s words, but it was difficult to be mindful of them, when he was not in his cell. How easy it would be to slip out unnoticed. The guards would hardly be a problem, they were so few in number and so seldom did they check on the prisoners.
But then, if they really were on a ship, what would he do when he managed to sneak outside, even if it could be done as easily as he managed? Swim to shore? In the midst of a storm? It was pride and arrogance that had gotten him into this mess in the first place.
“Fine,” he said. He stooped over and slid the food door open. Once more, he put his newly acquired flexibility to good use, and forced his way beneath the tiny opening. Finally, he emerged inside the priest’s cell, and felt that now familiar but nonetheless overwhelming sensation of claustrophobia.
Still, he couldn’t help but smiling, as he stood there in the presence of his fellow inmate and companion. After all this time, a close look at the old man’s face.
It was as genial as it had been from further away, wrinkled and tired, but it was comforting in its familiarity. He reached out a hand, and the priest took it in his own, and returned the smile.
“You’d best have a look out the window, Mr. Sinews,” said the priest, “I’d rather not be caught with a visitor in my cell.”
Mr. Sinews nodded, and moved away from the priest and toward the window. He dragged the old man’s wooden bed toward the wall, and climbed up for a better view of the world outside the rain-streaked glass.
Looking out, he very quickly discovered why the storm seemed so close, and why the floor seemed so unsteady.
There were thick black storm clouds raging outside, and periodically, flashes of lightning followed by deafening thunder. But he was forced to fight off the unnerving sensation that the world had been flipped upside down. The clouds were beneath them.
“Do you see, Mr. Sinews?” said the priest.
“Yes,” he replied. “We’re in an airship, aren’t we? A dirigible prison?”</Text>

            <Synopsis>Roderick discovers Dr. Allen’s little home within the Resurrectionists’ facilities.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Having arrived in the identical office in the basement, Roderick took only a moment or two to investigate, but didn’t linger. Instead, he slipped off his shoes as was his custom, and headed into the hallway, acting as the tourist. If he happened to be discovered here, he would feign ignorance. Just looking for Mrs. Grimmer. I have an appointment, he would say. But to his surprise as well as his relief, the hallway was deserted, at least for the moment.
A series of office doors lined the hallway. He memorized the names on the plaques on each of the doors, but walked past most without bothering to try the locks.
Abraham Palmer, Bartholemew White, Rémy Mills, each of these he past without pause. The door labeled Mrs. Elizabeth Grimmer was locked. He quickly passed the engineer’s office, instead pausing at the door of the Alpha Laboratory. It opened with a soft click.
He peered into the dark, and felt a chill as his eyes settled on a huge glass fish tank filled with murky water. Finding a gas lamp upon the table, he turned it on, and looking over his shoulder, stepped closer to the tank. He placed his hands against the glass and cupping his head in his hands, stared into the dark water. Flecks of meat and skin floated past his eyes. A human finger was settled at the bottom of the tank. It was otherwise empty.
He stepped back, feeling suddenly ill. He put a hand upon his stomach, and willed himself not to vomit. He cursed, glanced nervously around the room to ensure that he was still alone. In the hall, he heard voices.
Feigning ignorance if discovered here suddenly didn’t seem like an option. Whatever grim experiments took place in this secret laboratory, they were not meant for the prying eyes of the uninitiated. He scurried towards the door and pulled it closed as the voices approached. He dimmed the lamp and locked the door.
He held his breath as they drew closer. He’d known it would only be a matter of time before they followed him down here, but he hadn’t expected it to be while he was trapped in a room with a man’s finger in an enormous tank of water. He pressed his hand against his mouth to muffle the sound of his breathing, and listened.
Silence reigned. Then, the doorknob clicked. His heart pounded furiously, and he let out a startled gasp, barely muffled by his hand. The voices resumed.
“It’s locked,” he heard. The receptionist from upstairs, he thought.
“Well, open it!” A second voice, male, gruff and impatient.
“I don’t have a key,” said the receptionist.
“Of course you don’t,” said the man. “Bloody useless.”
The voices began to fade, signaling that they were walking away, perhaps to retrieve the key.
“Do you think he’s in there?” he heard, indistinct and distant.
“Doesn’t matter. We need to get out of here. All hell’s about to break loose.”
When the voices finally faded entirely, Roderick turned the light back on and unlocked the door. He couldn’t make sense of that last comment, but whatever it meant, he thanked his lucky stars that he’d not been caught. He opened the door and returned to the hallway, shutting the door with a shudder.
After that close call, he ought to have retreated. Any man with sense would have done so, if he’d been foolish enough to end up here in the first place. But he didn’t think he’d have another shot at this, and he wanted to uncover this mystery and catch The Resurrection Man.
So, he continued, navigating the labyrinthine halls. Once again, he began to hear voices from down the hall. This time, the voices were many, indistinct, almost inhuman. Then he heard gunfire. He chose his path by avoiding the voices. He walked past the cells of a jail, the doors open, the cells empty. Finally, the hall ended.
The door that stood before him was different from the others. Instead of a name upon the door, there was an address. 44 Allen’s Street, it read. As if things could not get more bizarre, a mailbox stood outside the door, and a welcome mat lay upon the threshold of the door. There was a brass knocker upon the door. Under less unsettling circumstances, he might have laughed at the absurdity. Instead, feeling a bit silly, he lifted the knocker, and used it to rap upon the door.
While Roderick was not one to read penny dreadfuls, he was familiar enough with the story of Dr. Allen to understand the reference to 44 Allen’s Street. After all, his father had followed the case almost obsessively. It was how Roderick knew of the Resurrectionists. 44 Allen’s Street was supposed to be the address of Dr. Allen.
The door swung open. An elderly man stood before him. He looked sickly, almost emaciated, his skin jaundiced. He leaned upon a cane for balance, and breathed through a leather mask with tubes connected to a steel cylinder.
“Dr. Allen,” said Roderick. It was not a question. This was definitely him. It was no wonder the police had never caught him, if this was where he was hiding out. Roderick was clenching his fist. Though he was old and sick, there was no escaping what he’d done. He cut people into pieces and put them back together again, turned them into automatons, and called it science. “You utter fucking bastard.”
“Ah, I wasn’t expecting company,” Dr. Allen replied, ignoring the slight. “To whom do I owe the pleasure?”
“Roderick Steen. Sir,” he sneered. He unsheathed his swordstick, pointed it at the murderer, and forcibly entered the faux house.
“And what can I do for you, Mr. Steen?” said the old man, wheeling his oxygen tank backwards as he retreated into his living room. He took a seat with a resigned sigh.
“I want answers,” he said.
“Very well. Shall I make us a pot of tea while we sit down to talk?”</Text>

            <Title>Scene Three</Title>
            <Text>The blood seemed to have stopped flowing. Annabel had roughly patched him up with a strip of cloth from his skirt. It was badly ripped enough already, so she dared not worry about the scandal her bare legs might cause should she be seen in public in such a state. There were other, more pressing concerns.
“We’ve got to get out of here,” she said. “This isn’t the only elevator. The Resurrectionists could be right on our heels.”
Abraham agreed. He hurried out of the office, stopping only to retrieve another weapon, a shotgun he had hidden beneath his desk. Annabel had to remind herself that if he’d wanted to kill her he wouldn’t have needed the shotgun to do so. He could just as easily have left her to the Resurrectionists. Still, she wasn’t one to trust easily, so she kept a cautious distance.
“Bullets,” she said, holding out her gun. “Do you have any more?”
He opened another drawer, quickly fished out a small stash of ammunition, and handed it over.
“Most of the offices don’t have elevators into the basement. Just those of us who worked for Mr. Grimmer’s Society as well as the printing company and who are now members of the Resurrectionists. Besides Jonathan and Mrs. Grimmer, there’s only myself and Mr. Miles. Mr. Grimmer’s elevator is closest to this one; they’ll probably be headed there.”
His voice was muffled, as he had put the mask back on his head. Apparently he didn’t want his fellow Resurrectionists to know who had betrayed them. A wise precaution, she thought.
“Right,” said Annabel, opening the door and heading into the hallway in a hurry.
The employees of the printing company stared at her in scandalized silence, the women turning to one another to share in the gossip. Their delight, however, turned to shock when they noticed Mr. Palmer’ shotgun and Annabel’s pistol.
Without slowing, the pair hurried through the crowd, the shouts of the Resurrectionists announcing their arrival from behind. Barely pausing in his tracks, Abraham cocked the shotgun, aimed it at the Resurrectionists, and fired.
Screams erupted from the printing company’s employees, while a cry of pain arose from one of the masked Resurrectionists. They scattered for cover, though some of them raised their own weapons and began firing back. The chaos of screaming journalists, secretaries, and printers provided cover, until the Resurrectionists decided they weren’t likely to hit anyone but innocent civilians, and resumed the chase.
Meanwhile, Annabel and her trigger-happy acquaintance found the front door of the building and fled. They didn’t stop there, instead fleeing down the long driveway of the printing company with only the occasional backward glance to see that, yes, they were still being followed.
Another shot rang out, but it went wild. Mr. Palmer returned fire, forcing the Resurrectionists to take cover while he and Annabel fled. They sought cover behind a statue that marked the entrance to the driveway. A hail of bullets struck the statue, and Annabel had to cover her ears and eyes as the stone crumbled.
Abraham reloaded, stepped out from behind cover, and fired again.
“Go!” he shouted.
Annabel didn’t have to be told twice. She headed towards the street, waving her arms to try to flag down a passing cab. She looked back to Mr. Palmer, who was now running after her again, bullets bouncing off the ground mere inches from his feet. It was only by luck that he wasn’t hit.
Finally, Annabel managed to flag down a driver. He pulled the fly off to the side of the road, and she climbed inside, making room for Mr. Palmer, who practically dove into the coach.
Annabel belted out instructions to the driver, not worrying about where they were going, so long as the cab was moving. The Resurrectionists’ bullets had not proved to be terribly accurate, but they did seem to have considerable range. It was not until the fly turned down a side street that Annabel settled into her seat.
“Are you hit?” she asked Mr. Palmer. “Again, I mean?”
He shook his head. “Other than the shoulder, I’m fine,” he said. “Where are we headed?”
“Where would we find Mr. O?”
“Who?”
“Jonathan, I mean,” she said. “Mr. Grimmer.”
Abraham turned to the driver and rattled off the address of the Grimmer family household. Then he turned back to Annabel. The firearm he’d given her was now aimed at his stomach.
“I believe you promised me an explanation,” she said. “I want to know why you’re helping me. Tell me everything.”
Mr. Palmer nodded slowly. “I will,” he said. He indicated the driver with a nod of his head. “But not here. Not now.”
Annabel pursed her lips unhappily. With a subtle nod of her head, she reminded him that he was at gunpoint. “When?” she demanded, jamming the muzzle of the rifle into his gut.
He winced in pain.
“When we arrive at Mr. Grimmer’s residence, I’ll explain everything to the both of you, if that’s agreeable.”
Annabel nodded.
“Fine,” she said, “But no more secrets.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene Two</Title>
            <Text>It seemed to Jonathan that so far his attempts at solving the mystery of the Resurrectionists had been comprised of going from one unreliable source to another. It had begun with Miss Monday, who was at worst an assassin and at best a thief, and whom he inexplicably trusted most of all, though it was obvious she was keeping things from him.
Then there was Parson Sinews, a criminal by association if nothing else, and a murder enthusiast. He’d had plenty of dirt on the Resurrectionists, but it was coloured by fanciful theories, not to mention he was fixated on Dr. Allen.
Henry Ocelot, the owner of several opium dens and bawdy houses, who again seemed inexplicably trustworthy in spite of his reputation. Of course, even if Jonathan were willing to put his faith in that man, he had no idea where to find him; his calling card had been utterly destroyed by the rain. Perhaps Miss Monday would know where to find him, given her knowledge of the criminal network.
Then Dr. Simms, literally a mad scientist and a member of the Resurrectionists. Perhaps he’d once been loyal to Jonathan’s father, but it seemed obvious that his opium-addled mind had been further influenced by the notorious serum of Anthony Tidkins’ invention.
Dr. Allen, a frail old man whose murder spree had made him an urban legend, a bogey man. Supposedly he’d been under the influence of the serum, but that hardly meant he could be trusted. Again, nothing that man had to say could be taken at face value.
And then there was Mrs. Grimmer. Jonathan’s own mother, whom he’d twice overheard fraternizing with the enemy, and who had shot him with a tranquilizer. Was she working under cover, or was she truly a member? It was impossible to say. Jonathan would have liked to say that he could trust his mother, but he’d never had that bond that mothers and sons are supposed to have; he’d mostly been raised by the family’s servants, while his parents had been busy with the family business.
Finally, there was Manfred McCall, the family butler, who had urged him to trust Mrs. Grimmer. He claimed that she was still loyal to The Hunting Society, that she was working undercover to dismantle the Resurrectionists’ plans. But to trust Manfred McCall, Jonathan first needed to trust his mother.
After all this, and given that in the last two days he’d hardly slept a wink—unless you counted the time that he was out cold—Jonathan was more confused than ever.
It was thus with aggravation, rather than his customary nonchalance, that Jonathan made the acquaintance of Abraham Palmer.
“Mr. O,” he introduced himself, though it was painfully obvious that Mr. Palmer already knew who Jonathan was.
Still, while Jonathan was feeling inhospitable, he’d been raised in polite society. He gestured to an empty chair and invited Mr. Palmer and Miss Monday to take tea with him. At least if he was to interrogate the poor man, he would do so politely. Over tea.
Miss Monday settled into her chair and gulped back her tea as if it was the last cup on earth. Jonathan raised an eyebrow.
“It’s been a long day,” she said with a dismissive shrug, “I find tea to be quite the restorative, don’t you?”
Jonathan had to agree. He gave a casual shrug.
Miss Monday changed the subject, getting straight to business.
“Mr. Palmer came to my assistance following the incident at Dr. Allen’s. I cannot say that I trust him entirely,” she continued, looking directly at Mr. Palmer as she said this, “But he did save my life. I’m not sure why, given that he is a Resurrectionist, but he has offered to provide us with an explanation.”
Strange to think that throughout all this, Miss Monday had become Jonathan’s closest ally. She was a criminal, an assassin, but at least her intentions were clear. She wanted to bring down the Resurrectionists. If she was willing to hear Mr. Palmer’ explanation, Jonathan would do the same. He looked to Mr. Palmer.
The man was clearly wounded, his shoulder bandaged with a strip of cloth from Miss Monday’s skirt. He tried to hide a grimace as he took a seat. Blood had seeped through the bandage. The man’s injury offered Jonathan a modicum of comfort; at least if Mr. Palmer’ intention was to betray them, Jonathan would have the upper hand in a fight.
“What do you know about the Dead London experiment?” Mr. Palmer asked, apparently rhetorically, as he began to explain without waiting for an answer. “It is an experiment, designed to prove the hypothesis that certain people—“ He looked to Miss Monday, pausing meaningfully, “Possess a natural immunity to the Lazarus Virus.”
“And they intend to test this virus how?” Jonathan asked.
“Initially, they hoped to test it on the pair of you,” he said, looking from one to the other, Jonathan and Miss Monday. “They believed you would be the ideal candidates, as you were apparently both exposed to earlier forms of the Lazarus Virus and survived.”
“What?” said Miss Monday, looking at Jonathan in surprise.
He regarded her with an equal amount of shock.
“I don’t know what he’s talking about,” he said, looking back to Mr. Palmer for a further explanation.
Mr. Palmer shrugged.
“It’s not surprising that you would have no memory of the incident, but the truth is that when you were a young boy, you had the first documented case of the Lazarus Virus. You were in a delirious, feverish state throughout. You made a full recovery, with the assistance of a physician who goes by the name Dr. Allen. And his young assistant, Anthony Tidkins.”
“Jack,” breathed Miss Monday.
Palmer nodded.
Still in disbelief, Jonathan gestured to his female accomplice.
“What about her?” he said.
Miss Monday changed the subject.
“How do you know about all this?” she asked.
Mr. Palmer took a cautious sip of his tea. Evidently he didn’t share Miss Monday’s enthusiasm for the beverage.
“I worked for your father,” he said to Jonathan.
He began to offer an explanation of what he meant, but Jonathan cut him off.
“I know about the zombies,” he said.
“When your father died, the Resurrectionists began their hostile takeover. They already had members within the Hunting Society; when they started to drug the rest of us, it wasn’t long before they’d taken over.”
“How is it possible that you managed to avoid the drug?” Jonathan asked.
Palmer shrugged. “They slipped it into the tea,” he said.
“Ah,” said Jonathan. “You mean to say that as an American, you don’t partake in that very British pastime.”
“I’m big on coffee,” he admitted.
“Alas, I have none on offer.” Jonathan looked the man in the eyes, trying to read him. Like Miss Monday, Jonathan couldn’t say that he trusted the man entirely, but there were elements of truth to his story. And what’s more, he actually liked the gentleman, which was more than he could say for Parson Sinews, Dr. Allen, or—dare he say it—Mrs. Grimmer.
There was a casualness to his manners, a slouch to his posture, a shrug to his gestures, that made him quickly relatable to Jonathan, who’d spent much of his life being lectured on manners—and then immediately forgetting them. Still, if he could be trusted, Abraham Palmer could be a useful ally. Putting his interest in saving London from a plague of the undead above polite conversation, Jonathan leaned forward.
“Getting back to Dead London…” he said.
“Right,” said Mr. Palmer. “Initially they’d intended to test their hypothesis on the pair of you. However, that proved difficult. To tell you the truth, I wanted to give you up to them. It would have been so much simpler, so much better than the alternative. Of course, Mrs. Grimmer wouldn’t hear of it. Dead London is Plan B. The idea is that to test their hypothesis, they’d need a large enough body of test subjects that they’d be certain to find some participants who possessed that much-sought-after immunity.”
“So where would they find a large enough body of subjects?” asked Miss Monday.
“London,” he said simply. “They plan to unleash the Lazarus Virus on the entire population of London.”
Jonathan looked at him in disbelief. “How?” he wanted to know.
Miss Monday had gone pale. “Jonathan,” she said. It was the first time she’d used his given name. “I think he’s telling the truth. When Jack tried to expose me to Lazarus, he used a vaporizer. If the virus can be spread through the air…”
“My god,” Jonathan breathed.
“So, you wonder why I’m trying to help you?” said Mr. Palmer. “Given that I’ve not been dosed with the serum, I should think it would be obvious. This experiment has to be stopped, at all costs.”
Miss Monday, setting aside her tea, took a key from around her neck. “Would you excuse me a moment, gentlemen?” she asked, getting out of her seat. “Clockwork parts to wind,” she explained.
She crossed the large room, found herself a table and a mirror, far enough from Jonathan and Mr. Palmer that she could wind up her gears without interrupting their tea, but close enough that she could still follow the conversation.
“So what now?” said Jonathan. “Why are we headed to the Moirae Tea House?”
“A meeting of the Vigilance Committee,” he said. “We believe we’ve found a way to stop the experiment, but it will take all the help we can get.”
“Who’s we?” Miss Monday asked from across the room.
Palmer directed his attention to Jonathan. “Those of us who remain loyal to your father and have not been brainwashed by the Resurrectionists. There were others, but we believe they may have been compromised. At the moment, it’s just me and Mrs. Grimmer.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene Two</Title>
            <Text>The door’s bells jingled behind Jonathan as he stepped out into the rain. He had no umbrella to unfurl, as he hadn’t been expecting rain when he’d headed out. He scanned the sky for his ride home, but it was difficult to see in the rain and darkness. He thought he saw a light flickering from above, its light refracted by the falling raindrops and the mist rising off the cobbles, but he wasn’t sure.
He made his way to the gate, keeping to the path of stepping stones, and pushed it open. Tidkins and the others were nowhere to be seen, but Jonathan could barely see his own two feet as the rain began to fall in earnest, so they might not have been far. A deep, low voice resonated through the fog from behind him.
“Mr. Grimmer.”
It was Henry Charles Ocelot. Jonathan spun around to face him and was surprised to see the man’s face so close to his own.
“Mr. Ocelot,” said Jonathan, having to speak up to be heard against the noise of falling rain and crashing thunder.
“Sorry if I startled you, Mr. Grimmer,” the large man replied. “I wanted to ask you…the man who was murdered this evening, the one you mentioned. Who was he?”
Jonathan bit his lip. It was only then that he realized he hadn’t actually said. He’d been spared by Tidkins’ revelation of the mass poisoning. Jonathan wasn’t sure he could trust Ocelot any more than he could trust Parson Sinews, but he needed all the allies he could muster at this point.
“Lord Henry Connor,” he said.
Ocelot said nothing as he took in the information, but Jonathan could see that he was deep in thought.
“This has something to do with the Resurrectionists,” he said. Jonathan looked at him in surprise, and he added, “Why else would you be here, Mr. Grimmer?”
Jonathan nodded.
“You’re right. I wouldn’t be here,” he said. “Can I trust you, Mr. Ocelot?”
“My reputation precedes me, does it not? I am a dangerous man, a criminal, a morally reprehensible reprobate, so rich even the police are under his fingers…or so they say.” He laughed, a deep baritone laugh. “But I believe you can trust me, Mr. Grimmer, because I think you and I are in the same boat.”
Jonathan raised an eyebrow. Was it possible that Ocelot already knew he was implicated in Connor’s death? It was possible he’d been at Connor’s party, but it seemed unlikely, given both his ethnic background and his reputation.
“Lord Connor was a Resurrectionist. I went to his ball to confirm it, but Connor was dead, at the hand of an assassin.”
If this was news to Ocelot, his reaction didn’t make this obvious.
“And who do you think hired the assassin?”
Jonathan spread his hands in surrender.
“Haven’t the foggiest.”
“If we can safely assume that he was murdered because of his connection to the Resurrectionists, then we must ask ourselves who else knew about this affiliation of Connor’s,” Ocelot prodded further.
“Well, his fellow Resurrectionists, for one, I would wager.”
Ocelot nodded.
“Yes,” he said.
Jonathan ran his hands through his hair, shaking rainwater from his head. He wiped the rain from his face and flicked it from his hand.
“But why?” he wondered aloud. Even as he asked it, an answer became obvious. Apparently his face belied his epiphany.
“You believe Lord Connor had a change of heart,” Ocelot said. “He intended to expose his fellow members.”
Jonathan nodded.
“That would be my best guess,” he said. “If there’s anything else you can tell me about the Resurrectionists. Anything at all that might help me…”
“Parson Sinews is a great resource,” he said. “Obsessive, and utterly addicted to the grotesqueness of the Resurrectionists’s activities, Dr. Allen in particular. He followed the Ripper case with similar interest. The case of Dr. Palmer. Burke and Hare.”
Jonathan blinked at that. How could Sinews have followed the Burke and Hare case? It was well before his time. That would have put Sinews at over seventy years of age.
“He has a difficult personality, I know,” Mr. Ocelot continued. “I have known him for many years. I believe you can trust him. And I believe in his theories, even the most radical of them.”
“Even the one about the mind control serum derived from pufferfish toxins?”
“Well, when you put it like that…” Ocelot laughed. “Still, I believe it warrants consideration. But if you really want my advice, Mr. Grimmer…” Ocelot trailed off. He was looking in the opposite direction.
“Yes?”
“Someone’s coming,” he said. “Quickly.”
Ocelot grabbed Jonathan’s arm, and roughly dragged him from the sidewalk to the adjacent alleyway. They hid beneath a tall tree, and Jonathan watched in breathless silence as a procession of carriages drove into sight and rolled to a stop in front of the Tea House. The passengers began to climb out of the carts, wearing bobby hats and brandishing truncheons. They surrounded the tea house, just as its front door opened.
“What’s going on?” Jonathan whispered. They must have been looking for him. Perhaps Captain Merrick had spotted the Black Marias from the air, and that was why he’d moved the ship. Resourceful of him, no doubt, though he wished he’d been able to send some sort of warning first.
“Quiet,” Ocelot whispered back.
“Mr. Sinews,” they heard the police officer call. “Or should we say Dr. Allen?”
They couldn’t make out Parson’s reply from where they stood. Thunder continued to crash, and rain hammered down on the cobblestone, as cacophonous as a rushing river.
“You are under arrest for the murder of Lord Henry Connor,” said the police officer. His voice resonated, even against the noise of the storm.
Jonathan watched in stunned silence as the policemen surrounded Parson Sinews, drawing their guns as the man’s reply carried through the fog.
“You think I’ll make it so easy for you?” he shouted back.
The sleet and fog blurred Jonathan’s vision. He couldn’t be entirely sure what he was seeing, but Sinews was a blur of motion, in one place one moment, in another the next. The policemen opened fire, the gunshots echoing along the empty street, but Sinews was too quick.
Jonathan’s breath escaped him as a policeman flew ten feet into the air and landed hard upon the pavement, unmoving. He hadn’t even seen Sinews hit him, but he must have. Another officer cried out, and a cloud of blood sprayed from his neck. His body fell to the gutter, and Sinews practically flew from him to the next man. More blood hit the gutter. Necks snapped. Sinews was everywhere at once, but there were bullets flying, just as quickly.
Blood painted the street red, and suddenly, there was Parson Sinews again, no longer a blur of motion. Just a crumpled form on the ground, heavily wounded. Still, he was laughing, even as the remaining policemen cuffed Sinews and carted him off into a maria. In a few moments, they had rounded up their dead and wounded and were off again.
The street was empty, save for Jonathan and his strange new ally.</Text>
            <Comments>Glad to see he remembered!

Uh oh! Run, Jon, run!
-Jordan White
Big leap of faith here for Jonathan, but the absinthe could have loosened him up to the idea of providing this information.

Maybe more speculation? What reason does Ocelot give that Jon trusts him? Maybe a trade off?
-Jordan White
Robber, unless Jonathan is convinced that Mr. Monday was lying and really is an assassin.  In that case I suggest indicating that in your story.
Oooo, interesting!</Comments>

            <Title>Scene 80</Title>
            <Synopsis>Annabel, Roderick, and Palmer try to fend off the zombies.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Cold surgical steel sliced into rotten flesh, cutting through gristle and tendons as easily as carving a roast. Slabs of rotting meat began to pile up in the doorway, but still, they pressed forward. Annabel tried to get a count, but it was impossible to gauge how many there were with the door half-closed and their grunting, snarling faces so close to her own.
She planted a firm kick at one that had gotten too close for comfort, sending him sprawling backwards, but another one took his place. Intestines dangling, utterly naked, with blood in her blond hair, the zombie snapped her teeth, inches from Annabel’s neck. She heard a cry of pain from beside her, Abraham’s voice, but she had her own problems. She thrust her blade into the woman’s skull, heard the crunch of bone and brain, and moved on.
Killing the zombies was simple enough, once she had the hang of it. She only had to destroy the brain. Any other wound would not suffice. Destroy the brain, and the body would go limp, cease attacking.
Easier said than done. Annabel grabbed the hilt of her blade, pulled it from the skull of her latest kill, and went for the next one. Her blade caught him beneath his jaw, aimed upward into the brain. He went limp. Again, she set her sights on another that had gotten too close, pulled the blade from the man’s jaw.
She cried out as two zombies grabbed her at once, one of them by the hair, the other by her right arm. The blade clattered to the floor and disappeared as the zombies climbed over it. She felt another set of hands seize her as she fought to fend them off.
Her hair had come loose, as the walking corpse had gotten hold of it, and it was in her face. He was pulling at it, trying to bring her head closer to his gaping mouth. The other one was trying to get at her throat, but she was holding him off with her arm.
The third one had suddenly let her go, and she heard the disturbing slop of something juicy being eaten. She couldn’t see what it was with her hair in her face, but she detected the smell of warm blood mingled with the smell of rot. She heard the crunch of gnashing teeth, the moans of contentment for the unliving.
She started to scream, but she knew there was nobody to help her now. It was Palmer that was being eaten. Her screams fell silent, turned into a whimper as they began to finish their meal and set their blood-wet fingers on her cheeks and on her neck.
She raised her arm. It was all she could do to keep that one from getting at her neck. She felt a clump of hair tear out of her scalp, but suddenly she could see again. See the unliving man’s jaws close around her arm. He clamped down until his rotten teeth ripped throat her shirt and into her arm.
Suddenly, she heard gunfire, and she felt the cold hands being pried off of her. She dealt with the one on her arm, punching him with her left until his face caved in and he stumbled back. She broke his legs with a sharp kick, and he fell to the ground. With a cry of rage and adrenaline, she stomped on his skull with her boot, killing him.
Panting for breath, her face and hair slick with cold wet blood, she turned to her saviour. For a moment, she’d thought it might have been Palmer, not dead after all, but it was Jonathan she found before her. He was looking at her with a mixture of horror and relief. She offered him a smile, which given her current state, was probably not very comforting.
“Not that I’m unhappy to see you, but what are you doing here?” she said, relief actually creeping into her voice.
Ignoring the question, he took a cautious step towards her.
“You’ve been bitten,” he said. There was no question in his voice. He’d seen the zombie biting into her arm.
“I’m fine,” she said.
She took a moment to survey the room. The scientists were all dead, with the exception of Dr. Simms, who was cowering beneath one of the hospital beds. There were still zombies strapped to the beds. There was blood everywhere, and body parts and corpses littered the floor. Abraham’s body was unrecognizable amidst the pile of bodies. She shuddered and turned away. She felt like she might be sick.
“Let me see your arm,” Mr. O persisted.
“I said I’m fine.”
“I must insist,” said Mr. O, “You do realise that a bite from one of these creatures can be fatally infectious? If your skin is punctured…”
She looked up from her task. She’d found a rag amongst the scientific equipment, and after wiping the blood from her face, was using it to clean her boots. She fixed him with a deadly stare. “I’m. Fine.”
Apparently not being one to back down, he ignored the warning in her voice. “We don’t know for certain that you’re immune,” he said, concern written all over his face. “Please, just quit being stubborn and let me examine you.”
“He’s right, you know,” said Dr. Simms, coming out from beneath the metal cot. “If you’ve been bitten, and if you’ve been infected, it’s possible we can still stop the infection from spreading if we amputate.”
Finally, Miss Monday relented. She began by peeling off her glove. “Little late for that,” she said, scoffing.
“It may very well be,” Mr. O replied, managing to sound both sarcastic and concerned for her welfare.
Then she drew back her sleeve, and he fell silent.
He stared at her quietly, as he suddenly understood her reluctance to allow him to examine her arm. As she’d said, there was no cause for concern about the bite.
Her arm was a prosthetic. Like the clockwork eye she strapped to her face each morning, it was made of mechanical parts. Gears which clicked as she rotated her forearm, hydraulics which hissed as she flexed her artificial muscles. Gears clicked with the steady rhythm of a clock each time she rotated her wrist. Each joint bore a keyhole. The key with which she wound her clockwork eye was a perfect fit for her arm as well.
It was made of copper and brass, with the same extraordinary workmanship as her mechanical eye. It moved with quiet motions, even as the gears whirred and clicked. She demonstrated the dexterity in her hand by flexing each of her fingers in turn, clenching her hand into a fist.
“See,” she said, “No bite marks.”
In awe, Mr. O reached out a hand to touch her arm.
“Don’t,” she warned him.
He retracted his hand.
“Sorry,” he said. “It’s just…”
“What?” she said, covering up her arm again with her sleeve. “Freakish? Inhuman?”
“Fascinating,” he murmured. He was looking at her in a way that she found unsettling. Unsettling in that it was sincere, honest, and—dare she think it—affectionate.
She blushed. No one had ever looked at her in this way, not after they’d seen her arm. Most men blanched at the sight of her eye, and the scar that ran down the length of her face. She was pretty, sure, but she was also disfigured. If the eye wasn’t enough to turn people away, her arm most certainly was.
But Mr. O reached out, gently, and touched her cheek. She flushed, hot, and felt her heart flutter in her chest.
“You’re not a freak,” said Mr. O. “You’re extraordinary.”
He put his hand against the back of her neck, leaned in close, and let his lips linger half an inch from hers.
Almost against her will, she reached out in return, and pressed her brass hand against the back of his neck, pressed her body close to his, and pressed her lips against his. She felt too vulnerable, too exposed, with her arm uncovered like this.
Her breath caught in her throat, and she felt a warmth in her very bones, as he returned her kiss. Her heart pounded, and she felt her cheeks flush, red-hot. It started as a gentle kiss, his lips tenderly caressing hers, but it quickly gave way to passion and fire, and he kissed her roughly, grasping her by the back of the head tightly.
Maddeningly, he suddenly pulled away from her, but it was only to catch his breath. Then he leaned back in and began to plant kisses upon her neck, small wet kisses that moved their way up her neck and caused her to grasp the hair on the back of his neck and press herself as close to him as she could. She pressed her left hand against his hip, and she moaned softly as his teeth tugged at the lobe of her ear.
He put his hand upon her arm. She couldn’t feel it there, not exactly, but she felt a slight pressure in her shoulder, where the prosthesis was affixed to her flesh.
After a moment, she drew back and looked at him like an addict might look at a bottle of absinthe. With a mixture of wariness and attraction. She staggered back and looked about in horror.
“My god,” she said. “Such horror abounds, and yet here we are. Locking lips while the plague spreads. We must truly be deviants.”
“I’m sorry,” he told her.
“Don’t be,” Annabel replied, leaning towards him once more, much to Dr. Simms loudly vocalized discomfort. “I’m afraid I rather liked it.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>Mrs. Grimmer left him at the door to the Quartermaster’s workshop. Other things to do, she said. He indicated his indifference with a shrug.
“One more thing though,” she said.
He nodded and inclined his face to look up at her.
“Several of your agents,” she began. Mr. O braced himself for the news. He knew what she was going to say. “Several more of your agents are missing in action. Presumed dead. Rémy Mills. Bartholomew White.”
He nodded grimly and pushed open the right-side door of the workshop. He forced a smile.
“I see you’ve met Dr. Simms,” said Mr. O, cutting the obvious tension in the room.
“Yes,” Miss Monday snapped. “The old man was just interrogating me about my prosthetic eye.”
“Old man, you call me?” Dr. Simms protested. “Youth these days,” he grumbled. “No respect for their betters.”
“Betters? My left tit!” Miss Monday exclaimed, to the doctor’s astonishment.
“Where does she get such colourful expressions?” Mr. O said with an awkward laugh, as if Miss Monday were a badly trained puppy.
“Well, I was raised by time travellers,” she said with no humour in her voice.
On that note, Mrs. Hallward, gave an awkward curtsey, and hurriedly took her leave. Mr. O couldn’t say he blamed her. Dr. Simms’ utter lack of manners was enough to put anyone at unease, and Miss Monday’s defensive personality could be equally abrasive. Clearly, this was his own fault; not wise to introduce gasoline to matches.
“Dr. Simms,” said Mr. O. “Surely, you have some reason for questioning my guest regarding a subject of such sensitivity?” He emphasized each word in the sentence as if to remind Dr. Simms of his lapse in etiquette.
Not paying any heed to the reprimand, he grumbled his reply, shaking a finger at Miss Monday. “This loathsome woman,” he began, staring daggers at her, “Wears a device manufactured by the same diabolical villain who made this.”
He reached into the chest of the dead girl on the table and retrieved the device. About the size of a melon, it was covered in dried blood and was made almost entirely of brass, though it had tubes and wires along its sides.
“What is the meaning of this?” he demanded, staring intently at Mr. O. “Do you know what this is? This is a device of espionage. Able to record conversations and play them back at a later time.”
“What are you implying, Old Man?” said Miss Monday, folding her arms across her chest. “That I’m a spy?”
“I’m not implying anything.”
“Stop it, both of you,” said Mr. O.
Miss Monday closed her mouth, but still she glared at Dr. Simms, he frowned back at her unapologetically.
“Are you certain that both these devices were made by the same man?” he asked, indicating both Miss Monday’s eye and the device Dr. Simms had retrieved from the unliving girl.
“Without a doubt,” said Dr. Simms, looking only at Mr. O. “I recognise the craftsmanship. They were both made by my predecessor. Dr. Tidkins.”
Mr. O winced at the mention of his name. Miss Monday rounded on him. Her fury turned from Dr. Simms to Mr. O. Suddenly, she was in his face. “Did he just say Dr. Tidkins was his predecessor?”
“Uh, well, er, yes,” he stammered.
“Ah, well, I suppose you simply forgot to mention that little fact?”
“I meant to tell you,” he protested. “But my mother interrupted our conversation. Yes, Dr. Tidkins worked for the Agency. Briefly. Then one day he disappeared without a word. That was when I hired Dr. Simms.”
Miss Monday shook her head in disbelief. “I don’t suppose you ever saw his face, or learned his real name?” she asked.
Mr. O shook his head. “He wore the mask.”
“And that didn’t strike you as odd?”
“Odd, yes,” said Mr. O. “But odd isn’t always bad, is it? Dr. Tidkins was brilliant. His work here was invaluable. He was on the verge of finding an antiserum. We were willing to overlook the oddity of a man in a mask if it meant there might be an end to the unliving plague.”
Miss Monday sighed. Of course she could not argue that. She knew how valuable a cure might be. And how could she fault Mr. O for putting his trust in Dr. Tidkins? She’d once put her trust in the same man.
“Not to mention, he had an excellent mind for machinery,” Mr. O was saying. “We still have those Icarus wings you mentioned. They’re lying around here somewhere.”
“Is that possible?” she wondered, ignoring the slight change in topic. “An antiserum?”
“He believed that the secret to the cure was in the blood of corvine birds, which seemed to be immune to the virus,” said the Quartermaster.
“Corvine birds?” she said, exchanging a look with Mr. O. “Crows, you mean?”
She was finally beginning to form a picture in her head, finally beginning to understand Mr. O’s theory. “Sounds like Dr. Tidkins all over. He and Dr. Karnstein were obviously studying the unliving. So after our mission in Haiti, Dr. Tidkins came here to work for you, putting his own knowledge together with that of the Agency, and used what he knew to begin working on an antiserum.”
Mr. O nodded, confirming that they were on the same page. Until now, she’d just been working off of theories and ideas. But this last piece of the puzzle somehow made those theories tangible.
She stared down at her arm, though its mechanical parts were covered in the fabric of her sleeve. She felt betrayed by her own arm. Her own eye. She wondered if she would still have wanted the prosthetic if she’d known what dark intentions lurked within the mind that had created it.
“The Society of Immortals,” she muttered, almost to herself. “A secret collective of scientists who claimed they could bring the dead back to life. Dr. Tidkins and Lord Connor were members. Perhaps Dr. Karnstein as well. So they joined, or formed a secret society with the intention of studying the unliving, hoping to find a cure. Systematically eliminating anyone who might interfere with their goals, whatever those might be…” Her speech trailed away as the last few pieces finally fell into place. “No,” she said. “We can guess at their goals. They were working on the cure, which means…”
“They plan to unleash the disease. And sell the cure,” said Mr. O, nodding. There was a smile upon his lips, an expression that suggested he was amused—no, impressed—that she had figured it out. Which annoyed her to no end. How long had he already known what she had only just figured out? How many other pieces of the puzzle was he still keeping from her?
“There are still so many unknowns. And you’re still keeping things from me,” she complained. “So, let me ask you. Evidently, whatever was in Lord Connor’s safe—before he moved it, I mean—is important to Dr. Tidkins' cause. So what was it, do you suppose? The antiserum he was developing, perhaps, smuggled out of his old laboratory?”
“Not likely,” said Dr. Simms. “He would have had that already. No, it’s something else.”
“The virus itself?” she asked.
Dr. Simms looked at her as if she’d just sprouted a third arm. “As you can bloody well see, he has that already, as well.” He gestured at the unliving girl’s body as evidence. “I suppose we won’t know unless we track down the package. But perhaps a more thorough examination of the girl’s body will provide some fresh insight. In the meantime, Mr. O, I believe Mrs. Grimmer has apprised you of the other situation?”
Other situation? As if the one situation wasn’t enough.
“Right,” said Mr. O. As if reading her mind, he turned to Miss Monday. “Another mission,” he explained.
“Of course,” she said, barely disguising her annoyance. “Not as though we’re in the midst of saving London from its potential destruction at the hands of a collective of mad scientists with the means of creating unliving monsters.”
“This is important,” he said. “And it may be relevant. In any case, we’re waiting on Dr. Simms’ examination. Might as well make the most of our time while we wait.”
She pursed her lips doubtfully.
“Also,” he continued, “I will likely require your assistance. Would you mind terribly—”
Unbelievable, she thought, crossing her arms and frowning bitterly. “Not a problem,” she interrupted. “Not as though I’ve got anything better to do.”
“Excellent,” said Mr. O, ignoring her sarcasm. “Dr. Simms?”
“Ah, yes,” said the Quartermaster. “I think you’re going to enjoy this one.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>A low, black fence, with twisting vines of wrought-iron, lined the front entrance to the innocuous meeting place of the Vigilance Committee. Beyond the fence, against the wall of the Tea House, large white gourds grew on vines, like albino pumpkins. The name of the tea house was lit by a pair of lanterns in sconces on either side of the door. The Moirae Tea House.
He stepped through the gate. The walkway was a series of stepping stones. Quaint. He made his way up the front steps, but paused at the entrance. There was a window, and as he leaned over the railing that lined the stairway, he was able to get a glimpse inside, despite the curtains. His view didn’t reveal much. It had begun to rain, not hard, but enough to obscure what little view he had. Still, he could see two men sitting at a table, drinking tea. There might have been others, but it was impossible to tell. Little choice but to go inside. He pushed open the door, to the tinkling of bells.
He had been wrong in his estimation of numbers. There were not two, but three gentlemen, and with them, a lady. It was the most unlikely assemblage of people he could have imagined. The lady, for instance, was elderly and heavy-set. Dressed prettily, in a cream-coloured skirt and blouse, with a hat that was accented with flowers and ribbons. The gentleman next to her, by contrast, was a rough-looking man who evidently shared Jonathan’s own passion for liquor but lacked the ability not to spill it on his clothes. He wore a bowler hat, a thick set of whiskers, and had a scowl on his face.
The next man was a rough-looking gentleman, who Jonathan recognised immediately by reputation not by introduction. This was Henry Charles Ocelot, a businessman of ill repute but considerable wealth. A former Haitian slave and plantation worker, with rough skin and scars covering most of his night-black face. The man’s thickly muscled neck was adorned with a necklace of brass-painted bone. His right eye was red as blood. When he smiled, he revealed a set of yellowing teeth, many of them chipped or filled with gold. The man could easily have been mistaken for a pirate, but in truth, he was the proprietor of several establishments where a man might indulge himself in any number of deadly sins. Opium dens, for example. Gambling houses. Prostitution rings. All manner of vice and depravity were among his many business ventures, and Ocelot was a genius at business, marketing, and avoiding the strong hand of the law. But what was he doing here, of all places?
Jonathan did not recognise the gentleman sitting to Mr. Ocelot’s right, but he guessed straight away that this was their host for the evening. Handsome if not pretty, the man was clean-shaven, and delicately featured, with an ivory-white complexion and thickly lashed eyes. He had an irrepressible grin plastered on his face that suggested an ironic or perhaps sardonic sense of humour. He was dressed in rich clothes which he wore with a certain disregard. His jacket hung from his chair, while his vest and shirt were both buttoned only partway up. His collar was not ironed. His sleeves were rolled up. His hair was uncombed, as if he’d only just gotten out of bed. Yet he was handsome enough that these faults did not seem like faults at all, but seemed to add to his charm. Jonathan hated him immediately.
“Is this the Vigilance Committee?” asked Jonathan.
“It is,” said the man he’d guessed was their host.
He stood up, crossed the room, and shook Jonathan’s hand.
“Parson Sinews,” he said.
“Mr. O,” Jonathan replied, sticking to the pseudonym he’d adopted earlier.
“Yes, of course. A pleasure to make your acquaintance,” Mr. Sinews replied. Then, before releasing Jonathan from his handshake, he pulled Jonathan closer. He was stronger than Jonathan had expected. “I know who you are, Mr. Grimmer,” he whispered in Jonathan’s ear.
Jonathan’s blood ran cold. Then Parson released him from his grip, and returned to his seat. With a gesture, he offered an empty chair to Jonathan. Stunned silent, Jonathan merely nodded, and took the seat. He wanted to ask Mr. Sinews how he knew him, but he also wanted to retain the anonymity he had with the others, so he held his tongue, while Parson made the introductions, banking on Parson’s discretion.
“Mrs. Marianne Hatton,” he said, indicating the only lady in the room, “Is the widow of Lord Edmund Hatton.”
“The politician?” said Jonathan. Parson nodded. “Enchantée,” said Jonathan, to Mrs. Hatton.
“Edward Steen,” Parson continued, indicating the drunk to Mrs. Hatton’s right. “A former and formerly esteemed member of London’s finest men in blue.”
“Pleasure to meet you,” said Jonathan.
“Fuck off,” Steen replied.
“Alright then.”
“And of course, the renowned businessman, Mr. Henry Charles Ocelot.”
“A pleasure to make your acquaintance,” said Ocelot. His voice was deep, and gruff, but his manners were surprisingly refined for someone whose appearance was so intimidating. He had the slightest hint of a Haitian accent.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” Parson continued, and with a sweeping gesture pointed to Jonathan. “It is my pleasure to introduce you to Mr. Jonathan Grimmer, a little-known writer and journalist whose father owns Grimmer and Sons Printing Company.”
Bastard. So much for anonymity.
“Used to own Grimmer and Sons,” Jonathan replied tersely. “The company has recently fallen into my own hands, with my father’s recent passing. Sir, how do you know me?”
“When you write your articles and publish them in your father’s paper, do you not sign them with your name?” said Parson, as if that was answer enough. “I endeavour to be well informed, Mr. Grimmer. I assume that’s why you’re here as well? Information?”
Jonathan shook his head. He grinned. Parson didn’t seem like a man easily given over to shock, but this ought to surprise that smug smile off his pretty little face.
“Yes, Mr. Sinews. But I’m not here as a journalist. Not exactly.” He kept his eyes on Parson’s face as he continued, deciding to use Lord Connor as his excuse for coming here, rather than reveal that his father had been killed, probably by Resurrectionists. “A man was murdered this very evening. You endeavour to be well informed, Mr. Sinews, as you say. Perhaps you may have known him.”
“Who?” Parson replied. He was no longer smiling. “Who was murdered?”
Jonathan was about to answer, but the jingling of bells interrupted him. The door swung open, and a masked man stood in the entranceway.</Text>
            <Comments>substantial rewrite: Jonathan visits Parson Sinews’ home, rather than the Tea House, following the rewrite of Ch. 6. Must therefore remove a number of the side characters (Marianne Hatton, Ed Steen. HC Ocelot should be Sinews’ valet). When Jonathan witnesses Sinews’ arrest, it is at Sinews’ home address.
This is in the middle of the night, correct?  It sounds like she is wearing a daytime outfit.
I would leave this out. Better for the reader to imagine!
Oh no! He was found out! How?! I demand answers! :D

Did her husband recently die? If so, I would think she would be in mourning.  Even if she didn't particularly like her husband, I believe she would be wearing black or at least dark colors.</Comments>

“So,” said Mr. Sinews, “These waste buckets they give us? When they empty them, they just toss the shit overboard?”
“No,” said the priest. “They put the shit in a bowl and call it porridge.
He laughed at his own joke, though Mr. Sinews looked like he was going to be sick.
“I’m joking, I’m joking,” said the priest. “But really, you ought not to ask questions to which you don’t wish to know the answers.”
“I know, I know,” said Mr. Sinews. “It’s not like me to ask such questions. I’m just bored, really. I need to get out of this prison. I wasn’t made to be kept in a cage.”
“You’re a gentleman, Mr. Sinews, aren’t you? You come from wealth, yes?”
“I was a gentleman,” said Mr. Sinews, “Now. I’m a prisoner. All the wealth in the world won’t change that.”
“Prison isn’t kind to a man who is used to such freedom,” said the priest. “As I said, you will have your freedom. But be patient.”
“Right,” said Mr. Sinews with his characteristically bitter laugh.
He climbed out of his bed and ran his hands through his hair, which was becoming long and stringy. He sat down on the floor to begin his routine of stretching his legs. His first venture outside his cell had been a success, but it hadn’t been easy, and it would become more difficult still if he failed to keep up with his regime.
“This prison,” he said, thinking aloud, “It can’t stay airborne forever, can it? Occasionally they’ll have to land somewhere for fuel and supplies and to keep the balloons full of hydrogen.”
“Of course,” said the priest, “You are right about that. But if you’re thinking that the best time to escape is when the ship is aground, I’m afraid you may be mistaken. The security is relaxed when we’re in the sky, because the guards know as well as we do, that even if you do escape your cell, there’s nowhere for you to go. But when we land, that’s when you’ll see a change in the guards, not just in their number, but also in the seriousness with which they take their jobs. No, your best chance of escape is when we’re airborne.”
“And what?” said Mr. Sinews, “Just fly out of here? Like a bird, I’ll simply flap my way down?”
“Something like that,” said the priest.
“Alright, Daedalus,” he replied. “We’ll just build ourselves a pair of wings and stick them to our backs with candle wax.” Mr. Sinews grinned. “Once again, living up to your name, Priest.”
“You mock,” said the priest, “But what if it could be done? Wouldn’t it be worth trying?”
“Yes,” Mr. Sinews consented.
“So,” said the priest, “As I said, it will take time and preparation. First, we’ll need to get our hands on the appropriate supplies.”
“And how will we do that?”
The priest winked, knowingly. “The guards are not all without religious affiliation. They bring me whatever supplies they can get away with bringing me. I absolve them of sin.”
Mr. Sinews returned the priest’s grin.
“And in the meantime,” said Faria, “I have books and wisdom to offer you, my friend.”
“I’m not sure about the books,” said Mr. Sinews, “But I could certainly do with some wisdom.”</Text>

The first major plot point changes everything. This is the point of no return for your characters.

The First Plot point, which may or may not have been foreshadowed in previous pages, and may have even begun to appear in some form or fractional proportion, is the moment when the hero’s near-term priorities and goals change, either in the form or a need or a desire — such as survival, understanding, truth, justice, love, health… a long list of near-term goals — and it includes the presence or implication of an antagonistic force that seeks to oppose that journey.

This definition is, in fact, what your story is all about.  It’s not about what happened, as a primary thrust, before this point, because everything that happens before the FPP by definition appears for the purpose of setting-up this transitional moment.</Synopsis>

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>“Have you ever heard of a man named Leonardo da Vinci?” asked the Quartermaster.
Mr. O answered the question with a deadpan stare.
“Right,” said the Quartermaster, after a while, “Of course you have. Well, perhaps then you’ve also heard of some of his inventions, eh? The Aerial Screw?”
Mr. O shook his head. Truth be told, he was more familiar with da Vinci’s artwork than his inventions.
Taking that as a sign for him to continue, the Quartermaster elaborated, “It was an early prototype for a flying machine—a sort of helicopter. Of course, da Vinci was ahead of his time. The world was not ready for such a device. Not yet. Now, at last, we are in the Age of Invention. We are at the height of technology. The Steam Era. The Turn of the Century. Things are different now.”
Miss Monday’s curiosity had gotten the better of her. “You’re saying…?”
“Yes,” said the old man, removing his spectacles. He retrieved a pair of pilot’s goggles from a hook on the wall and placed them on his head.
“You’ve built it?” said Mr. O.
“Indeed,” he muttered, as his attention wandered. He returned his attention to his workshop.
“May I see it?” Mr. O asked.
“See what?” said the Quartermaster, seemingly startled by Mr. O and Miss Monday’s presence.
“The helicopter, obviously,” said Mr. O. “We would like to see it.”
At that, the old man turned away from his workshop and came walking back toward Mr. O, brows furrowed.
“A helicopter?” he exclaimed. “Are you mad? It cannot be done.”
“But you just said…the Aerial Screw? You said you’d built it.”
“I know what I said, boy. Don’t put words in my mouth.”
“But…” Mr. O stammered.
“We haven’t built a helicopter, you Ninnyhammer. Get that through your dense skull, man. Now, what we have built is nonetheless quite impressive, I think you’ll find.”
“Yes?” said Mr. O, somehow managing not to react to the old man’s belligerent manners. Miss Monday caught his attention. Knowingly, he nodded, gesturing for her to lean in so he could mutter an explanation beneath his breath. “Dr. Simms is quite brilliant. Unfortunately, he’s also…”
“Senile?” she whispered.
“Well, no. He’s just addicted to opium. His mind is a bit addled.”
“Oh, is that all?”
“Ah, yes,” said the Quartermaster, apparently not having heard their whispered conversation. He beckoned to Mr. O and Miss Monday to follow him into the workshop. Miss Monday lagged a bit behind, not altogether reassured by Mr. O's explanation.
The old man led the way through piles of assorted and dust-coated tools: gimcracks and gewgaws the functions of which Mr. O had only the faintest idea. The old man paused to pick up a lantern.
Despite his age and addled brains, the old man moved quickly.
At the back of the workshop, his assistant had disappeared unnoticed and was standing next to what must have been covering the invention to which the Quartermaster had alluded. Not a helicopter, perhaps, but judging by its size, it must have been at least as grand. It was bound with broad sheets of canvas, but the boy was working at untying the set of ropes, which kept the canvas in place.
The old man hoisted the lantern high enough to cast an amber glow on the machine as the boy unveiled it, one sheet of canvas at a time.
Mr. O’s breath caught in his throat. It was incredible.
It reminded him of his other airship, and truly its design was not so very different. But it was much, much larger than any airship he’d ever seen. It had four individual ballonets encased in a long canvas envelope, the Quartermaster explained. And it had huge leather wings attached to its sides—wings that looked like fins. It also had a tail at the rear like that of a whale, and it bore a sail mounted on its spine like a dorsal fin, so that it had the appearance of a flight-capable whale.
Affixed to its underbelly were wooden beams and ropes which connected the inflated canvas whale to the ship’s gondola, which would house the crew and the ship’s artillery; despite the whimsical nature of an airborne whale, there was no question that this was a war vessel.
In keeping with the nautical theme, the gondola had the appearance of a sailing vessel, complete with a steering wheel at its prow, and cannons along the gunwales. Levers and gears, pistons and other mechanism fulfilled other functions that Mr. O could scarcely guess at, but there were guns mounted nearly everywhere aboard the ship and he knew exactly how those functioned.
He was eager for the full tour, but for the moment, he was content to wander along the ship's length, asking questions of the Quartmaster as he went. He had to crane his head to get a good look at it, such was its size. The boat—or gondola, as the Quartermaster continued to call it—must have been at least two stories tall, as the sail on top of the balloon scraped along the high ceiling.
Clearly, the old man had not been alone in its construction, a thought that irked him. So much for the clandestine operations of the Agency, which, he considered, was supposedly scraping the bottom of their piggy bank. Yet his mother was content to hire a crew to build this extravagance. Well, that was mother for you, he thought. How in the hell were they going to get this ship out of the building, he also wondered.
Very little of the ship's deck remained unused. Most of its vast space was occupied by the crew cabin, and the engineer's cabin at the rear, both of which were enclosed.
Tall, wide windows lined the front of the cabin, as well as the bridge. There were portholes along the sides of the ship. The captain’s nook, at the helm of the ship, would face the open air, with only a railing along the sides to prevent the captain from falling. Of course, there were ropes that he could use to lash himself into place if flying at full speed. Of course, if he prefered, the ship could also be operated almost entirely from within the safety of the ship's bridge.
"Captain Merrick, however, prefers to fly topside," said the Quartermaster.
So, apparently this was not to be the airship's maiden voyage, Mr. O thought with barely disguised annoyance. He hated being the last to know things.
Beneath the ship were three retractable sails, which when used with proper sailing techniques, would provide both lift and power to the ship and carry it to great lengths and heights.
Both the gondola and the balloon were plated in what the old man described as “armour.”
“Armour?” asked Mr. O.
“The ballonets are filled with hydrogen gas,” explained Dr. Simms, “Which keeps it aloft and also maintains the structural integrity of the balloon. Therein lies the danger; hydrogen is extremely flammable, hence the armour. So of course, you’ll have to refrain from smoking.”
“Very well,” said Mr. O.
The old man frowned, “That goes for your crew, as well. I can’t stress enough just how flammable this gas is. I should mention, the armour will provide only minimal protection from stray bullets, should you run into any trouble.”
“Bullets?” said Miss Monday. "Why should there be bullets?"
Dr. Simms looked at her as if he’d forgotten she was in the room, snorted, and returned his attention to Mr. O.
“If you’re taking heavy fire, simply raise the safety shields. They’ll slow you down a bit, as the shields do prevent the use of the sails and wings along the balloon, but I’m sure that’s preferable to going down in flames. I’ve already provided instructions to your crew.”
“Duly noted,” Mr. O said, but he was hardly listening. His eyes were still poring over the airship. A name had been painted on the balloon in a bright red circus style font. The name seemed appropriate with the exception of the implication of its being inexpensive.
The Penny Dreadful.
He looked at Miss Monday and noted that she was still staring with equal fascination at the vessel. Though she had previously traveled by airship, this vessel was clearly more impressive than the one in which she’d travelled with Dr. Tidkins in Haiti. And indeed, it was more impressive than Mr. O’s previous airship.
“Your other airship didn’t attract enough attention? I thought this was supposed to be a clandestine operation. Or have you decided to let everyone in London know about the unliving?”
Apparently he’d mistaken exasperation for fascination.
Mr. O shook his head, marvelling at the invention, and at last regained the power of speech. “I was unaware this dirigible had been commissioned.”
“Really?” she replied with heavy sarcasm. “How is that possible?”
“If I had to guess, I’d say my mother commissioned it. And to think, I was stressing over whether or not she’d continue funding us. She never was planning to cut funding, was she?”
Ignoring the question entirely, the Quartermaster replied, “What do you think of her, sir?”
“I’ve only got one question.”
“Yes sir.”
“Is she ready to fly?” Mr. O asked.
“Yes, sir.”</Text>

	Role in Story:	
	Occupation:	Fortune Teller
 	

Physical Description:	

	Personality:	

	Habits/Mannerisms:	
 	

	Background:	One of the Moirae, also known as the Three Fates, and the Daughters of Nyx, Atropos is a fortune teller, who claims that she and her sisters truly are the three fates of Greek mythology – eternally ancient and powerful, they control each man and woman’s fate.  If their claim is to be believed, their most notable power is of course dominion over fate – yet it is not their only power. They are also seers and can use this gift to see into the future. Although their story is hardly believed in popular society, they have earned a reputation for hauntingly accurate predictions when it comes to their fortune-telling business.  Atropos is the eldest of the sisters, known as the Inflexible. Essentially the polar opposite of Clotho, she has dominion over death and therefore looks at the future with a sense of doom.  On the surface, she seems the most intelligent, dignified, and calculating of the three, yet she is ill-tempered and easily fooled. She is vengeful – utterly incapable of letting go of a grudge. She is also rather old-fashioned and has great difficulty keeping up with the changing times and is nostalgic for the past. At least, that is the persona the fortune-teller has adopted.

	Internal Conflicts:	

	External Conflicts:	The sisters constantly engage in sibling rivalry, bicker with one another and sometimes even engage in physical fights amongst themselves.

            <Title>Scene 1</Title>
            <Text>Lord Henry Connor’s annual masquerade was reputed to be the grandest ball in all of London. The extravagance of the event could not possibly have been overstated, nor the number of attendants exaggerated.
The families who attended were notable and prominent in London politics and business, science and commerce. Aristocrats, foreign dignitaries, ministers, and scientists. The well-to-do. The sort of ladies whose choices of garments would make the morning Post. The sort of men who earned more in an hour than most men earn in a year and for whom the idea of hard labour is as terrifying as the bubonic plague.
The receipt of an invitation to the masquerade was widely considered to be a compliment of the highest regard. Young ladies would wait with increasing suspense to see that cream-colored envelope enclosed with Connor’s seal, and failing to receive one, would be understandably brought to the brink of despair.
Annabel Grey was perhaps the exception to that rule. She had neither received an invitation to Lord Connor’s ball, nor had she barricaded herself in her room in a fit of tears. Of course, Annabel was not exactly a lady, per se. Just a common woman, who had worked her way into the upper echelons through hard work, perseverance, raw talent, and most importantly cheating.
Even her identity was stolen. Her adopted name, Miss Monday, for example.  The real Miss Monday had died in a tragic house fire, along with the rest of her family. It had been simple enough for Annabel Grey to assume Lady Monday’s identity by retrieving the paperwork concerning her death. The unfortunate young woman had no surviving family members to dispute Annabel’s claim, and Annabel had friends who specialized in insurance fraud. Annabel had dozens of identities—earned in a similar manner—but Miss Monday was a particular favourite. As Miss Monday, Annabel had claimed not only the insurance money, but also a sizable inheritance from her parents, who had both died in the fire.
Still, Annabel had not anticipated an invitation to Lord Connor’s. In fact, she’d had no plans to attend the party.
Not until recently, anyway. Now, her circumstances had changed. Now she had to get into the ball. Not only that, she needed to seek an audience with Lord Connor himself. As for the lack of an invitation, that was hardly enough to deter her.
Her success in the endeavor fortunately depended on the sheer size of the masquerade, and as she climbed out of the hansom cab, she saw that Connor had not disappointed in that regard. There was a line of cabs along the street as long as the street itself, and consequently Annabel had to watch her step to avoid treading in horse filth.
Just as the street was lined with hansom cabs, Annabel could see a long line of young ladies and gentlemen which wound its way along the walkway through the garden.
With all those people to provide cover, sneaking in shouldn’t prove difficult. Even with additionally hired staff working the door, how could Connor’s butler possibly be expected to stop her, determined as she was to sneak in? It was, she determined, simply a matter of blending in.
She’d decided to take advantage of the fact that the ball was a masquerade. With that in mind, she’d chosen for herself a brown leather mask, which managed to hide both her feminine features and her missing eye.
She’d dressed in a pair of trousers and a black waistcoat. She’d donned a grey frock coat and ascot, and accessorized with a top hat, men’s shoes, and spats. She placed a watch in her pocket to complete the illusion, and carried a cane with a rather exotic elephant’s head pommel in ivory. As always, she wore a small brass key around her neck.
As a gentleman, she looked convincingly dapper. She walked with a practiced gait so as to disguise her femininity.
She took a moment to come up with a plan. In the past, she’d had success with home invasions by making her way around to the back of a house and entering via the servant’s entrance, or an open window, or even, on one occasion, a wine cellar. But the side of the house was blocked by Connor’s elaborate garden, which sprawled across his lawn on either side of the front walkway. Annabel didn’t fancy treading through rose bushes to get around the side of the house. There had to be an easier way. Perhaps, she thought, a head-on approach would be best. She decided to use the front entrance.
Still, the line was remarkably long, and she had little interest in waiting in it.
Instead, she simply ignored the line entirely. She threaded her way through the crowd with ease. As she was dressed as a gentleman, she could walk about unchaperoned without drawing any unwanted attention.
She bumped into a gentleman and a young lady who stood conversing with another gentleman, making it look like an accident. She pardoned herself, and they parted to make way for her, looking a bit put off. She walked away with an invitation in her hand.
“Dear Mr. Grimmer, you are cordially invited…” she read.
So, I’m Mr. Grimmer, she thought.
Quickly, moving through the crowd, she crossed the threshold of the door. Just one more gentleman and lady stood in front of her. She waited patiently as the butler hurried to greet them. Their coats, having been removed, were taken by a servant to the coat room, while the butler compared their names against a list of attendees.
Annabel gathered that the gentleman was a duke of some sort, but she failed to catch the name. Not that she cared, particularly. When the butler had found the name, he nodded genially and beckoned to the pair to follow him into the adjacent room.
When he returned, it was her turn. She provided her invitation, and the butler found her name on the list. He nodded, took her overcoat and cane, and gave them to a servant to take to the coat room. Then, he offered to escort her into the foyer. So far, this had gone even more smoothly than she’d expected. She was in.
As the butler showed into the foyer, she took a moment to survey the scene. She barely noticed the grandeur of the Connor manor. She took note of the size of the room but scarcely noticed the high, gilded ceilings, the huge Grecian statues which adorned the room, the numerous paintings upon the walls. Her only interest was in finding Connor.
“Where might I find him?” she asked the butler, dropping her voice half an octave below its normal range. She had some practice at that, as well. “Lord Connor, that is.”
“I’m sure you’ll find Lord Connor in the ballroom, if not presently then shortly. He’ll be wearing a stag’s head mask in a shade of dark plum,” he added.
“Thank you,” Annabel replied, taking her leave of the butler.
She swept from the foyer to the ballroom. A massive circular room, Connor’s ballroom, designed by Lord Connor himself, was made to impress. With enormous cogs and gears lining the ceiling, and an enormous steel rod through the center of the floor, the room was slowly turning, like a ballerina in a music box. The effect was impressive. It must have taken an enormous amount of power to drive the ballroom’s engine, but Connor’s guests seemed suitably impressed by the revolving ballroom. Annabel couldn’t have cared less about the grandeur of it all. She brushed past servants who might have offered her refreshments, paying no mind as the floor moved beneath her feet. As she weaved her way through the crowd, the sound of the musicians playing a rousing tune grew in volume, but she had no inclinations of dancing.
The floor was filled with dancers, who moved with grace about the room. Those who were not dancing were either seated at one of the tables or dispersed in small groups throughout the ballroom. Ladies were pencilling in appointments on their cards, and gentlemen were politely making introductions and seeing to the needs of their ladies.
She didn’t feel any eyes on her. She was in. So, she thought, on to the next task. She needed to find the Lord of the manor.
The ballroom was huge. She began to sweep the room, first making her way around the perimeter. She looked at each masked face she passed, systematically eliminating them, looking for a tall, middle-aged man in a dark plum stag’s mask. He should be easy enough to pick out of a crowd, but she’d still seen no sign of him. Eventually, she’d gone around the entire circumference of the ballroom and still not found him.
Perhaps he was among the dancers. She found a stop at the edge of the dance floor and watched as each paired couple circled past her. As the waltz drew to an end, she felt certain she’d checked every single mask on the dance floor. There was no sign of Connor, at least not in the ballroom.
The nature of the ball seemed to have prevented his guests from noting his absence for now. They were either preoccupied with the festivities or they were simply unaware of what mask he was wearing and assumed he was there somewhere.
When another of her host’s servants offered a tray of sweets, she smiled, thanked him, but declined. She took the opportunity to ask if he knew where she might find Lord Connor. She followed his directions to a flight of spiraling stairs, which led upstairs to Connor’s private apartments.
“It is off limits to guests, however,” the servant noted, “But I’m sure Connor will be down shortly.
At least he was more helpful than the butler, she thought.
She thanked him and made her way to the staircase in spite of his warning that Connor’s private quarters were off limits. At least she wasn’t entirely alone on the staircase. It wasn’t exactly bustling with activity, but as she climbed the stairs, she passed a couple of other gentlemen. She watched as they headed out to the balcony, presumably for a cigarette. She glanced back to see if anyone was watching. When she was sure that no one was, she veered off down the hall, away from the balcony and towards Connor’s private quarters.
There was a locked gate to one side of the staircase, which appeared to open up to a hallway.
A locked gate was no obstacle for Annabel, once she had her lock picking kit in hand. It didn’t bother her that she was breaking the rules. So long as she didn’t get caught. After a few moments of fiddling with the lock, she heard a distinctive click. She tried the gate, and it slid open. She grinned.
She made her way along the gas-lit hallway and quickly arrived at the door to Connor’s study. A tall door of dark oak, it had a long scar along its length where the wood had cracked. It was slightly discolored, stained perhaps, in a few patches that might have been fingerprints. Stained a dark, dull red.
She reached for the handle, in the dim light, and felt her hand cling to the doorknob. She gave a start. Her glove was stained crimson. It might have been wine, she thought, but every instinct was telling her that it was blood. She should have turned around here, given up on her mission, and gone home. It was foolish to ignore the warning signs. She knew that. But she’d done so much work to get here, and her prize was just on the other side of that door. She could risk one little peek, couldn’t she? She could always back out if there really was something dangerous beyond the door.
Whose blood was it, though, she wondered. Her hand hovered at her gun belt as she reached again for the handle.
She turned the knob and pulled the door open. It gave a groan of protest, but it was unlocked. It swung open on old, well-used hinges. She stepped inside and closed the door.
There was no immediate sign of any struggle. Connor was slouched in his armchair, facing the opposite direction. He looked like he was sleeping, but she couldn’t get a good look from her angle. She stepped further into the room, cautiously scanning the room as she did.
The room was small and unassuming, unlike the rest of the house. It was neat and organized. An old bookcase took up the entire length of one wall, a large wooden desk sat in front of Connor, with little atop it: a stack of paper, a feather pen, inkwell, a letter opener, the purple stag mask, and a kerosene lamp that must have been running out. It was flickering weakly, casting shadows across the room. The carpets in this room were plain in comparison to those in the ballroom downstairs.
Tiptoeing so as to catch Connor off guard, she crept further into the room. She drew her gun and made her way silently across the short span of the room until she drew close enough to realize how stupid she’d been, or how blinded by greed. She stood only an arm’s breadth away from him. Close enough to see that he wasn’t asleep. He was dead.
Suddenly, she realized how obvious it was. She should have known from the moment she opened the door, but she hadn’t wanted to see it. There were flies buzzing around his motionless body. The smell that came from him was enough to make her choke. 
She hesitated. She knew she ought to call for help. But she also knew that if she did, she wouldn’t have the chance to steal her prize from Connor’s safe. She cursed herself, knowing that she’d already made up her mind, and knowing that she’d made the wrong choice.
“I’m going straight to hell,” she muttered, turning away from Connor.
In the opposite corner of the room stood Connor’s safe. It was disguised as a tea trolley, but it was a weak disguise, and Annabel was quick to determine what it really was.
She lowered her mask, revealing a face that was beautiful and delicate on one side and scarred on the other. A long, jagged scar ran from eyebrow to cheek, interrupted by the bulky mechanical contraption that was strapped over her right eye. She allowed the mask to hang from her neck while she retrieved her lock-picking kit.
She heard a noise from behind her. She swung around, raising her gun instinctively. Connor stirred, shuffling in his chair and looking up at her. He groaned softly.
“Good god,” she gasped, “You’re still alive.”
She put a hand on his forehead. He felt cold. She stooped over to get a good look at him. She recoiled when she got a clear look at his face. His eyes were white and lifeless, his skin grey and cold.
“What on earth…?” she whispered to herself.
Now, she thought, she had really better call for help. It was one thing to turn her back on a dead man—he would still be dead after she’d robbed him—but it was another thing entirely not to help a man who was clearly sick and on the brink of death. There was a cold, lifeless look in his eyes that made Annabel take a cautious step back.
But before she had a chance to shout for help, Connor opened his mouth and snapped his teeth at her, hissing. Annabel stumbled back, lost her balance, and crashed into the desk.
Hitting the floor with a hard thud, she lay there awkwardly for a moment, the wind knocked out of her. Her gun, which had been in her hand only a moment ago, was suddenly nowhere to be found. In a moment, with surprising speed, Connor had flopped his way out of his chair and landed hard on the floor. He began crawling his way toward her ankles.
Annabel lay on the floor, struggling to regain her breath. She could only watch as Connor reached out with a hand that was gnarled and decaying, grasping for her. His breath was hoarse and ragged. He moved with a relentlessness that made Annabel shrink back, though his movements were clumsy and stiff.
He managed to grab hold of an ankle. He held her with a tight grip and used her leg to pull himself closer still. As he inched his way towards her, the kerosene lamp burned out. The last few strands of the wick flickered away, plunging the room into darkness.</Text>
            <Comments>Good characterization and introduction.
she had no surviving family, yet had a large inheritance?  From who?  Usually (always?), inheritance comes from a family member.  I suppose it's possible for Miss Monday's last surviving family member to have died, and left the inheritance to her, without knowing her status.  But, this seems a bit strange.
- make this clearer
I like how you tossed that in there. It changes the reader’s visual of the character.

I agree.  I like it when there is just a general idea of the character and then continue to build both on how they look and personality.
wordy - also, backwords
Maybe some thinking of what she needs to do? Maybe think back of other endeavours (because she seems like a crafty girl) and choose what she wants to do in the moment? It seems all too pre-planned for me without showing her pre-planning it.
Would not the tone of her voice give away her femininity?
- this is her first line of dialog in her masculine attire. Point out that she’s dropped her voice an octave or two.
Maybe Annabel didn’t feel any eyes on her?
I think some reaction from her is warranted here. It’s clearly a crime scene. Maybe have her show some sort of crisis? She did a lot of work to try and talk to Lord Connor and now she stumbles upon this mess! What is she to do?
“Ooh, twist!”
I like how the light flickering away is reflective to this being the end of the chapter.</Comments>

            <Text>It took some time aboard The Penny Dreadful for Jonathan’s nervousness to entirely abate. Once he got used to the turbulence and to the ease with which Captain Merrick handled the ship, his nerves began to settle, this being helped by the vehicle’s well-stocked bar. The sound of the ship’s wings beating like those of an enormous bird, the whir of the ship’s propellers, the mechanical clang of clockwork and the hiss of steam pumped out a rhythm which became calming as it became familiar.
The recently upgraded airship handled much like it had before, though the addition of the metal shields had necessitated the additional sails and propellers. Surprisingly, it still travelled just as quickly as it had before how much heavier it was. It was a relatively smooth ride, too; so long as he avoided looking out the windows, it was easy enough to forget that they were hundreds of feet in the air.
They had circled London several times over in search of their quarry, with no sign of it. He’d been led to believe there would be a trail of destruction in its wake, but London was a vast city, and it took several turns about the city before they discovered any clue as to its whereabouts. When they did, the trail led beyond the city limits. Now, the offensive stench of London Town receded as the vessel sailed from city to country.
The speed of the airship was astonishing. Still, when Jonathan looked through the window at the world passing by below him, though the sparse buildings and trees looked like tiny toys, he was surprised to discover that he was quickly finding himself more and more relaxed. The world outside was dark, lit only by the moon and the electric lanterns which hung from the airship.
"How fast are we going?" Jonathan asked.
“Quite fast, sir,” was Professor Ashcroft's reply. Once again, he’d invited the man to join him in the passenger’s lounge. He preferred not to be left alone in a room with Abraham Palmer, and Ashcroft’s knowledge of the ship was comforting. “Nervous flyer, are you?”
Jonathan shrugged. "Usually," Jonathan admitted. "But after the past few days' misadventures, I find myself surprisingly relaxed."
Professor Ashcroft smiled. “Well, for what it's worth, you’re in good hands. As I said before, Captain Merrick knows his way around a ship—dirigible, ornithopter, or otherwise.”
“Right,” said Lockwood, with a sly grin. “And I ain't so bad meself. Same goes for Mister Ashcroft, o' course.”
“Right,” said Jonathan, once again feeling his nervousness return in spite of the reassurances.
“Hm,” said Abraham Palmer. “I’d be a bit more concerned by our quarry than our journey.”
Kippar Lockwood paled at this. Even the more seasoned engineer, Ashcroft, looked visibly uncomfortable at the mention of their gruesome business. But he gritted his teeth and tried not to let his intimidation show.
“As we’re on the subject, and since we’re hopefully drawing nearer to locating it, I wonder if you might be inclined to tell us a bit more about this thing,” Ashcroft ventured.
“Very well” said Jonathan. “Perhaps Mr. Palmer will do you the courtesy of explaining our mission. I must attend to that most inconvenient necessity of replenishing my drink. It’s been that sort of day. Please excuse me for a moment, gentlemen.”
He stood, took his empty glass off the table, leaving a ring of condensation, and walked unsteadily to the bar at the rear of the cabin. Although Captain Merrick handled the dirigible with the utmost competence, this did not mean that the ship was quite so stable that Jonathan could walk steadily across the floor. The barman, however, had steady hands, which he proved by managing to pour Jonathan's drink without spilling even the slightest drop.</Text>

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>Years Ago

The sound of Parson Sinews’ leather shoes on cobblestone was louder than might have been expected from a man who walked with such grace and poise, an effect of reverberation. It was also an effect of perception, an auditory illusion caused by the relative loudness of footsteps against the otherwise still air.
There was a stillness in the air, interrupted only by the dance of shoes on stone, and with that stillness came the sensation that if Parson were to merely pause in his perambulation and to listen, he would hear nothing but the sound of his own blood pulsing through his veins.
Accompanying the rhythm of his steps was the occasionally tap of Parson’s walking stick, an accoutrement carried not as a medical necessity but as the must-have fashionable accessory of the modern London gentleman.
As such, Mr. Sinews did not lean heavily upon the cane but used it to accentuate the rhythm of his gait and to disturb the unnerving quiet as much as possible. Of all the things worth enduring, silence did not rank high on Parson’s list. Not merely in the auditory realm, Parson craved the chaotic and the voluminous. This silence disturbed him.
He quickened his step, increased the force with which he tapped his cane upon the ground, and abandoned the street in favor of a nearby alley.
The alleyway quickly brought him to the Singe residence. Too quickly. It was too sudden. He was not ready to see her, not like this. Still, he found himself knocking on the door.
It seemed only a moment later that Camille opened the door. The sight of her nearly stopped his heart. Staring into the lively blue eyes of the beautiful Camille Singe was heartbreaking. She looked like her. She looked so very much like her. A mirror image, an echo.
They had looked so much alike in life that Sinews had often gotten them confused, and Camille had found it amusing to play little jokes on him, planting kisses on his cheeks and calling him sweetheart. Now, it was difficult to look at her and have to remind himself that this was not Rachelle. That he would never look into the face of Rachelle and see life in her eyes, ever again. She was gone. Gone, and in her place, there was only Camille, a cheap copy. Only an imitation of the original.
“I suppose you wish it had been me,” said Camille, speaking in French, as she often did.
“Yes,” said Parson, cruelly, “I do.”
He stepped through the threshold of the door, and walked into that familiar household with its smells and sounds that brought memories rushing back violently and made him choke on its familiarity. The smell of coffee beans from the kitchen. The scent of lemon that always seemed to permeate the hallway for whatever reason. And, impossibly, the smell of Rachelle’s perfume from the stairway.
“Where is she?” he asked.
“Follow me,” she said in English. Her accent was thick, and her voice was cold.
He did as instructed and followed Rachelle’s twin up a flight of stairs, then down a dimly lit hallway and into the bedroom of his deceased fiancée.
A wave of nausea struck him like a kick to the gut.
There was a mask sewn to her face, made of a jumbled mass of animal and human skin and fur and bone. A pair of dog’s ears replaced her own. Both arms were connected to her shoulders by a system of pistons and winches. The mechanical parts ran straight through her, replacing her skeletal system with machinery. With the grinding of clockwork gears, she raised her arm and wave. The gesture was so delicate, so human, so familiar, that he wanted to gag and choke.
As the grinding of gears continued, she lower her arm, and smiled.
As had been done to her arms, her legs had been altered as well, severed and reattached in the same manner. But it was not merely her own legs that had been added back on. She’d gained a few new pairs as well, making her a hideous parody of Arachne. Eight bare legs, each pair different from the other, and each one covered in scars and stitches from thigh to toe. It was clear that most of the doctor’s horrifying work had been done while the women were alive.
He wanted to look away, had to look away. There was nothing in the world he needed quite so much as to avert his eyes, but he could not. He felt sick, but still he found himself drawing closer to this woman that had been Rachelle.
He drew closer still, until he was standing close enough to touch her. He was near enough to look into her eyes, those eyes that were still hers but which were dead. He laid a hand on her face, as gently as he could.
“What have I done?” he whispered to her, “What have I done to you?”
There was a clicking sound, followed by that same grinding of gears, the whirring of mechanical parts, and the nauseating sound of dead flesh creaking as it moved, reanimated by the automaton beneath her skin.
The sound was tinny and unclear, but the voice was unmistakably hers, and there was pain in her voice. He could hear her voice crack with every tear she fought back as she spoke to him.
“Wake up,” she said, “It’s just a dream. You need to wake up.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene Two</Title>
            <Text>When The Penny Dreadful first began its flight, pamphlets had been provided to the crew, on the subject of the mission. Only Jonathan and Mr. Palmer had copies of the handwritten letter, so it was to the pamphlets that Lockwood and Ashcroft now turned their attention, while Palmer explained and elaborated. The pamphlets had been prepared in a somewhat hasty manner, due to the urgent nature of the mission.
“I must remind you,” said Mr. Palmer, “Although the point has already been belaboured almost to death, it is of the utmost importance that neither of you should repeat even a word of what I am about to tell you, nor reveal the contents of those pamphlets. And when this mission has reached its end, I would urge you to put it out of your mind, as best as you are able.”
Giving only a moment’s pause for the crewmen to nod their acknowledgement, Palmer continued, “As I’ve already explained, Mr. Grimmer's father was an operative of a Crown sanctioned but privately funded organisation known only as The Agency. Following Mr. Grimmer's death, it was taken over by another secret society, known as the Resurrectionists. A few of its members, namely Mrs. Grimmer and myself, have remained loyal to the original Agency, acting secretly to undermine the Resurrectionists and their nefarious plans and to continue the Agency’s mission.”
Jonathan snorted. Put like that, it sounded absurdly grandiose. Palmer glared at him, and Jonathan looked down at his drink. Palmer continued. “In order to understand the Agency’s mission, you must understand this one thing: when a man dies, he does not consistently remain in that condition.”
“By God!” Lockwood blasphemed.
The older man, Ashcroft, merely opened his mouth but said nothing. The expression on his face said enough though. Well, mostly it said he thought Mr. Palmer must be insane or overly superstitious at the least. And that he thought Mr. Lockwood must be naive for believing him so readily. But also that he would humour him, at least for the time being.
“We have learned via the Agency's scientists and through the research of the Resurrectionists that death is a condition with varying degrees of finality. The creatures with which we are principally concerned are considered not dead but Unliving.”
“Unliving?" Lockwood repeated. "Not Undead?”
“That term is reserved for vampires,” Palmer explained.
“There are vampires?” he exclaimed.
“There are,” said Palmer.
Jonathan, having sweetened his beverage with sugar water, reclaimed his seat and nodded grimly. Then he finished Grimes’s sentence with a dismissive shrug. “In fiction.”
“These Unliving creatures you speak of,” said Ashcroft, ignoring for the moment the discussion of vampires, “What is the cause of their condition?”
“You mean, why don’t they just stay dead?” asked Mr. Palmer.
Ashcroft nodded. “Assuming what you say is true,” he added.
“They’re infected,” Jonathan answered, oversimplifying the matter somewhat.
Mr. Palmer agreed, “It’s a disease. Well, a virus. And a rather unpredictable one at that. From what we can tell, it’s passed from one victim to another via bodily fluids: blood, saliva, and so forth. Once infected, the victim begins to die. But it is in death that the disease truly takes its toll. After death sets in, he wakes up.”
Lockwood went wide-eyed at that, while Ashcroft's face remained impassive.
“Only when he does wake up,” Palmer added, “He’s hungry.”
“Hungry for what?” asked Ashcroft, his scepticism gradually giving way to cautious curiosity.
“They eat the living,” Mr. Palmer replied without gravitas. "What’s more, they cannot be reasoned with. They don’t generally talk, or think, or otherwise act like living men. These are monstrous creatures, abominable devils that must be put down like rabid dogs.”
Aside from the creature in the Resurrectionists' laboratory, Jonathan had little experience with these creatures, but from his little understanding of the creatures, he had to agree with that. The unliving were abominations.
“But here’s where it gets really interesting,” said Mr. Palmer, as if all the aforementioned information was not enough, “When a man is infected with this disease, he returns from the dead as a member of the Unliving…But when an animal is infected, the results are somewhat less predictable. Some animals react much like men; they die, then subsequently revive as terrifying, unthinking cadavers with no recollection of their former selves or loyalty to their former masters. Other animals show no signs of infection whatsoever; in particular, carrion birds tend not to react to the disease.”
“That's lucky,” Jonathan contributed.
Ashcroft nodded in agreement after only a moment’s consideration.
“Recently, the Resurrectionists began experimenting on various species of insects,” said Mr. Palmer. At this, his expression became grim.
“And?” said Lockwood.
“Many of the insects infected underwent a dramatic metamorphosis.”
“Meta wot?” said Lockwood.
“It means they transformed,” Ashcroft translated, “Like a caterpillar into a butterfly.”
“Right,” said Mr. Palmer, “Only quite significantly more dramatic than that.”
“Just how dramatic is this transformation?” asked Ashcroft.
“Well, it varies from insect to insect. Some, cockroaches, the common fly, and mosquitoes, as just some examples, undergo no change whatsoever. Leeches, lice, and ladybugs, on the other hand, are transformed into about the size of a Dalmatian. But let me put it this way,” said Palmer, “If this particular infected creature reaches the borders of France, the French will likely assume that it is an act of invasion, the first in a direct and deadly assault on the nation of France. It would mean all-out war.”
“By God,” Lockwood said again, “One lil' bug? An instrument of war?”
Mr. Palmer nodded. “Not so little,” he explained. “We call them Beasts. That is, Beings with Extremely Anomalous Supernatural Tendencies.”
“Supernatural tendencies?” Jonathan asked. Not all of this had been part of the letter he'd received, nor was it contained in the pamphlet. He stared into the murky green of his half-empty glass. He remembered what Palmer had said of Dr. Allen’s studies. He had made a particular study of genetic metamorphosis.
“Supernatural, yes. In other words, beyond scientific understanding if not the laws of nature themselves. In this case, the word refers to the propensity of certain insects to resurrect, transform into monsters, and become several times their usual size, when infected with the Lazarus Virus.”
“So,” said Ashcroft, almost as if he were saying it to himself, “Our mission is to exterminate this mutated Beast, preferably before it arrives at the borders of France.”
“Just so,” Mr. Palmer confirmed.
Palmer and Jonathan exchanged a look. Obviously there was more to it than that, but they had agreed not to share everything with the crew. For now, this was enough.
“So, you understand the gravity of our mission?” asked Jonathan.
“Assuming this is not an elaborate practical joke, yes, I believe so,” said Ashcroft, “But I wonder. Will this dirigible be enough to stop this creature? The two of you and a ragtag crew of aeronauts? Don't misunderstand me, gentlemen, it's an impressive enough aircraft, but still…”
“Two of us?” said Jonathan, “Oh, that’s right. You have yet to meet Miss Monday.”
Ashcroft gave a start. “Miss…?”
Jonathan nodded. He gestured toward the door beside the bar. “The lady wasn’t feeling herself. There’s a cabin with a cot behind the bar, apparently.”
“Are you quite serious, sir?” demanded Ashcroft, a bit too forcefully for Jonathan’s liking.
“Yes,” said Jonathan. He pointed again at the door, “The Engineering Cabin, I believe it's called. As it was unoccupied for the moment-”
“I am aware of the engineer’s cabin, Mr. Grimmer. I am intimately familiar with the airship, and what’s more, I am the engineer. What I meant was, are you quite serious about there being a woman aboard this airship?”
Jonathan shrugged by way of reply.
Ashcroft bit his lip as if to prevent himself from saying anything he might regret or which might prevent him from receiving a pay cheque at the end of the day.
“And wot good is a lady goin' ter be when we confront this overgrown insect?” Lockwood wanted to know, raising his voice. Apparently the lad was not as experienced as Ashcroft in the art of holding one’s tongue. “Forgive me for sayin' so, sir, but she’ll only get in the way. Especially if she’s under the weather. Perhaps she should remain confined ter the Engineerin' Cabin, but then again, Mr. Ashcroft will be needin' in there.”
“So what do you suggest? Throw the lady overboard?” said Miss Monday herself.
Mr. Lockwood had been so preoccupied with his rant that he’d failed to notice the door swinging open. Now, upon seeing her and being caught speaking ill of her, colour flooded his cheeks.
“Me lady,” he said, suddenly gallant, bowing his head and removing his cap.
She spat.
Lockwood blinked in surprise. He looked her over and quickly came to the conclusion that this was not your ordinary lady. Dressed in a tattered skirt and corset, gun belt at her hips, she had an athletic body that did not betray her feminine grace. But it was her eyes that truly set her apart. And not just the clockwork eye. There was an intensity in the look of her one good eye that was at once terrifying and entrancing. It seemed as though she were looking straight through him, into the depths of his soul.
“Don’t you worry about me,” said Miss Monday. “You’d have to say a lot worse than that if you’re aiming to hurt my feelings.”
She clutched her stomach and groaned as if she might vomit, then turned to the wall with the weapons rack and retrieved one that must have been to her liking. With the blunderbuss securely strapped to her side, she took a seat beside Jonathan, who made the necessary introductions.
“I may be suffering the effects of seasickness-” she said, when her stomach churned again.
“Airsickness,” Lockwood corrected.
“Whichever,” she said, “But if it’s a firefight we’re in for…” she paused to grin in a way that was surprisingly dreadful, “Don’t count me out on account of my being a woman.”
“An airsick woman with one eye,” Ashcroft muttered, then, upon feeling the effects of Miss Monday’s dreadful gaze, he muttered, “No offence.”
Miss Monday groaned again as the ship lurched under a brief moment of turbulence.
“And if I didn’t know any better, sir,” Ashcroft continued when Jonathan stumbled back to the bar for another refill, “I might think you were intoxicated.”
“I’m at my best when thoroughly intoxicated, I think you’ll find,” Jonathan slurred. He downed the drink, wiped his mouth on a handkerchief, and slammed his glass down on the bar. “You ought to try it, Miss Monday. I find it helps with the airsickness.”
Miss Monday shook her head. “I’ll stick with the tea, thank you.”
Ashcroft had to remind himself of how well the Agency was paying him for this job.
“I caught the tail end of the conversation. Enormous unliving insects?” she said conversationally. “What, precisely does this have to do with the Resurrectionists’ plans?”
“As I understand it, the Agency’s goal is to stop the spread of this Unliving virus. The Resurrectionists, conversely, wish to spread the virus?” Professor Ashcroft was astute. Jonathan was impressed. “Is it safe to assume, therefore, that this creature must possess some means of infecting people?”
Mr. Palmer nodded. “I should think so.”
“They must have a cure,” Ashcroft blurted.
“Why do you say that?” said Miss Monday.
“Why else would they be so determined to spread this infection?” he replied. “Spread the virus, sell the cure.”
Jonathan looked up at the professor in surprise. He hadn’t even considered that angle. He exchanged a meaningful look with Miss Monday. Was that what she’d been hired to steal from Lord Connor? The cure? It would certainly explain a lot.
“At any rate, never minding our capability of vanquishing this creature back to the hell from whence it surely came, will we reach it in time? How will we even find it?” asked Professor Ashcroft.
“If I understand correctly, our quarry is meandering, leaving devastation and destruction in its wake. We should find the creature easily enough, I should think, more likely sooner than later. In fact, if you would direct your attention out the window, just now…” said Mr. Palmer.
Immediately following this instruction, Jonathan turned to the window. His jaw dropped. Suddenly there was no longer any cause for doubt. The creature was real, but it was far worse in reality than it had ever been in his imagination.
Somehow he felt, after a moment, a vague sense of relief. Yes, the creature was real, a creature ascended from hell. But there was a bright side. At the very least, he had not soiled his undergarments. Looking at the Beast, this seemed a real possibility.
“You failed to mention this Beast would be armed," said Professor Ashcroft, donning his spectacles as he looked out the window, horror-stricken by what loomed outside.
The specimen in question, flying parallel to the Penny Dreadful but seeming not to have noticed the airship for the moment, was a behemoth. It was easily twice the size of the Penny Dreadful, but thrice as terrifying. With enormous, whip-like antennae, and a thick exoskeleton that seemed to cover its entire body, Mr. O had the disturbing suspicion that this abomination had once been a cockroach.
Now, in its metamorphosed state, the creature was barely recognizable as an insect at all. It was a monster. With long legs and huge wings which beat rapidly, carrying the unbelievable weight of the creature across the sky.
Still, the most unusual thing about the creature’s appearance was its armaments. Attached to its anterior limbs was a pair of mechanical contraptions that looked suspiciously like machine guns.
“Did I?” said Mr. Palmer. “Mea culpa.”</Text>

            <Synopsis>Roderick talks with Dr. Allen.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Roderick hated not having all the pieces of a puzzle. It made it difficult, if not impossible, to solve. So it was with hardly any concern for any possible danger he might be in, that he sat down for tea with the notorious leader of the Resurrectionists, a known murderer who had easily evaded Scotland Yard when the murders were linked to him.
“Biscuit?” offered the murderer.
“Thank you,” said Roderick, who had an affinity for sweets.
He added a ridiculously heaping spoonful of sugar to his tea, then reached back into the jar to reload the spoon.
The doctor scrutinized him. Bare feet upon the ottoman, dandyish in all other regards, he exuded an air of calm composure. It seemed the doctor was trying to determine if it was affected or not. He took another spoonful of sugar for good measure. At last, he took a sip, not taking his eyes off the doctor, whose eyes widened as he watched Roderick’s tea ritual.
“Tea with your sugar?”
“Are you really a doctor?” Roderick blurted out.
Allen smiled.
“I am,” he said.
“So, where does that name come from? Some little known penny blood?”
“You’re very clever, Mr. Steen,” the doctor replied, coughing into a handkerchief, then reaching out for his cup of tea. “Resurrectionists do take the names of penny blood characters, but my name is not a pseudonym. Allen is my family name. But that’s not what you really want to ask, is it? You want to know about the experiments. How I took people apart and put them back together again, like a tinkerer with an old clock. That’s what you want to ask, isn’t it?”
“I have many questions,” Roderick replied, “But sure, let’s start with the murders.”
“Murder is a bit of a dysphemism, don’t you think? I never wanted to kill anybody. I was hired by the military to conduct research on genetics. When my experiments failed—”
“Experiments for what purpose?” Roderick interjected.
The doctor gave a shrug.
“Various. I was to come up with a way of improving our soldiers’ chances in military affairs. I thought of a number of ways of accomplishing this, many of which were immediately dismissed. I could make soldiers who could light fires using only the capacity of their brains, but the subjects continued to burn themselves. I made shapeshifters, people who could shift from one shape into another, from human to animal. Some could even change their faces at will, become another person, so to speak. But the shift was incredibly painful, so the idea was dismissed.”
“You mentioned genetics,” Roderick said. He was intrigued, but this was a word he’d not heard before, and he read enough scientific journals to be current.
The doctor continued without really addressing the question.
“I used a number of Darwin’s theories as a starting point and worked from there. But it wasn’t until I reunited with Jack that my work really began to take off. Jack was my muse, my inspiration. His own ideas pushed mine to greater heights. He was obsessed with the idea of immortality, of curing death.”
“It was his research that led me to begin using mechanical parts in my experiments. If I could build a clockwork heart that could work just as well as an organic one, we wouldn’t have to worry about heart failure. Or if I could build a mechanical eye, we wouldn’t have to worry about blindness. You see? The possibilities this suggested, they were endless. For once, the military fully supported it. But Jack’s experiments were radical, and they required human subjects. The military approved. I did not.”
“But you conducted them anyway,” Roderick countered.
“I was given a drug, a serum of Jack’s design, which was designed to render me compliant. Instead, it caused psychosis.”
“So that’s when you began taking people apart,” Roderick summarized. He took a sip of his tea, but it was too sweet. He frowned. “You’re a very disturbing man,” he said bluntly. “Clever, I think, but disturbing. Tell me more about Jack. Who is he to you?”
Here, the doctor’s tone shifted. It was less defensive, more nostalgic.
“Jack Bernhardt. You might know him as Anthony Tidkins. But to me, he’s just Jack. My son. My brilliant, brilliant son. I taught him everything I know, but he surpassed me, easily, particularly in his knowledge of mechanical engineering. He was the founder of the Resurrectionists, a true visionary. At the time, his experiments were radical, but not entirely dangerous. It was only when he learned that I was dying that he began to take things too far.”
“Ha!” Roderick exclaimed, taking another biscuit from the tray. A pile of crumbs lay at his feet. Roderick truly loved his biscuits. “By your standards, that really is saying something.”
“Fearing that the other Resurrectionists would refuse to conduct his experiments, as I had, he used the serum to ensure their compliance, although its results were unpredictable. With some of London’s greatest scientists under his thumb, they abandoned their own research in favour of pursuing the Dead London Project. The victims—for lack of a better term—of Jack’s serum, obeyed his every whim. The Resurrectionists were no longer a scientific society. They were a cult.”
“Alright, that is going a bit far,” Roderick admitted.
“Thus began his experiments with Lazarus.”
“Beg your pardon? Lazarus?”
“You haven’t seen them, then? The zombies?”
A light went off inside Roderick’s head. Zombies. He was talking about the disease that had infected Lord Connor before his untimely demise, and which had plagued the ladies and gentlemen at his party, who had risen from the apparent dead. The men in the alley.
“So they’re not vampires?”
The doctor coughed. He reached for his oxygen mask and took a big puff of air. He mulled over the term.
“Vampires? I suppose it’s as good a term as any, but lately I’ve taken to calling these creatures zombies. Whatever you want to call them, they are the resurrected dead.”
“What sort of experiments were they conducting? What is Lazarus?”
“Lazarus is the name of the virus,” the doctor explained. “Jack believes that Lazarus is the key in his quest for immortality. He believed that he could cure the virus, but he needed to find test subjects who were resistant to the virus. And for that, he needed a large body of test subjects and a means of distribution. As for the latter, it was Lord Connor that came up with a solution. Unfortunately, Connor had a change of heart, so it had to be taken by force; a thief was hired for that purpose, and Connor was dealt with. And for the former, the population of London was large enough to provide the test subjects.”
“The population of London!” Roderick exclaimed.
“The Dead London Project,” Dr. Allen reminded him with a bit of a cough.
“Lovely. Doctor, thank you for the tea, but there’s no time to sit around while this experiment is allowed to continue. Will you help me to stop it, or do you intend to stand in my way?”
“Mr. Steen, much as I’d love to help you, I’m afraid it’s too late. Lazarus is already spreading. I was just about to make my escape when you showed up. It’s not safe here. We need to get out of the city.”
Roderick straightened his collar and stood up. He brushed the crumbs off his legs and ran a finger through his hair like a comb.
“Right then. How do we get out of here?” he said, remarkably calm.
“Follow me,” Allen replied.
He beckoned to his servant, and sent the man to fetch a mask for Roderick.
“Gas mask,” he explained, “Should keep you safe from Lazarus for a few hours. There’s an ornithopter in the Cappa Laboratory, which we’ll use to get out of London.”
Roderick nodded. He’d play along, for now. He had little other choice. But when we get out of London, I’ll have you arrested.
“I’ll need to make a couple stops along the way, if that’s alright. Do you have any more of these masks?”</Text>

Remember, a pinch point is basically a reminder of the antagonistic force’s power to stymie the protagonist’s goal.

“There is a crisis. She steps in with great intentions to ‘take charge’. However, she’s ill equipped so the problems continue and get worse, but each time she confronts, she becomes more skillful, until she is ready for her biggest challenge.”</Synopsis>

Prior to the Pinch Point, and after the first plot point, the protagonist is in "reaction mode." The character has just emerged from the dramatic events of the First Plot Point at the end of the First Act. His world has completely changed, whether positively or negatively, and he is scrambling to keep up with events. He’s in reaction mode. He is aggressively pursuing his main story goal, but he doesn’t quite have his feet under him. He’s scrambling to understand the obstacles that are being thrown in his way by the antagonistic force, and there is a lot he doesn’t understand–about himself, about his goal, about the antagonistic force, and about the nature of the conflict itself.
There is a crisis. He steps in with great intentions to ‘take charge’. However, he’s ill equipped so the problems continue and/or get worse, but each time he confronts them, he becomes more skillful, until he is ready for his biggest challenge.
Halfway through the First Half of the Second Act comes the First Pinch Point. This may be a major scene or a small moment, but it must be a moment that causes the protagonist to feel the “pinch” of the antagonistic force.

            <Text>Years Ago

Mr. Sinews spent each morning in his cell as productively as he could manage. He would begin each day following Faria’s advice, spending an hour at a time stretching his aching muscles. He would sit on his bed each time the guards made their rounds and stare at the walls like a man who’s lost his grip on reality. Sometimes he would talk to himself when they passed by, in order to really sell the illusion.
When they reached they end of the hall and rounded the corner, he would raise the door to the slot in his door, careful not to let the metal resonate too loudly, and slip out of his cell and into Faria’s. It was becoming easier over time, his body becoming thinner and more flexible with each day.
Faria eventually managed to procure a pocket watch that was reliable enough when he wound it twice a day, so it was easy enough to simply return to his own cell just before the guards made their second trip around the prison’s halls. They were like clockwork.
Once he was in Faria’s cell, he would assist the old man with the means of their escape. It was not a set of wings that Faria had in mind, as he had first assumed, but parachutes. He saw the logic in that. Parachutes, at least, had some history of success as a means of descent from hot air balloons. Still, it was risky to attempt it without the opportunity to sufficiently test their design, and especially from such a height as this. So it was understandable that the priest had demanded patience.
The priest also made good on his promise of wisdom, though it was not the sort of wisdom Mr. Sinews had expected. The father had apparently been an expert swordsman in his youth, and he taught Mr. Sinews how to fight with a pair of canes he had managed to obtain some years after his imprisonment and kept stored beneath his bed.
Sinews was a quick study, and he was eager to learn, as it was routine, exercise, companionship, and stimulation of the mind which kept him sane in spite of his circumstances. That, and the ever-present thought that he would eventually be free. And when he finally was, he would have his vengeance.</Text>

Mr. Sinews would hardly have recognized himself if he’d had a mirror to catch his reflection. His hair and his beard had grown long and unruly. He smelt of filth and sweat. His skin was dirty, his fingernails rough and cracked. He was thin and sickly looking.
But the priest, his ever-present friend and fellow prisoner. He knew that man’s face better than his own. He knew the man’s voice, even in utter darkness. He knew the sound of his breathing.
So Mr. Sinews had known for a while now that Faria was becoming sick. He’d noticed the change in the quality of the old man’s voice, noticed him becoming thinner, until his appearance was practically skeletal. He’d sacrificed portions of his own rations, sometimes entire meals, in his attempt at keeping the priest healthy.
But as time moved on, he knew that his friend’s condition was worsening, not improving. He needed proper medical treatment, but that was impossible, here in the prison. And the priest would not survive their daring skydive to the earth below, not in his condition.
There was little that could be done for his friend, except to wait and watch as he grew increasingly more sick.
When Faria’s breathing stopped, Mr. Sinews knew it instantly. He could hear the silence from his adjacent cell.
He ran to their adjoining wall, grasped the iron bars, and peered into the darkness, where Faria lay, unmoving, in his bed.
“Guards!” Sinews shouted.
And when no one answered he began to bang on the bars with the cane that the priest had given him for his sword training. “Somebody!” he called, “Please help!”
Eventually, the guards came strolling down the hall, as infuriatingly slow as they could manage.
“What’s all the fuss?” said one of the guards.
“It’s the priest,” said Mr. Sinews, gesturing frantically at the body of his deceased companion.
“What?” said the guard. “So, he’s sleeping?”
“He isn’t sleeping,” he protested. “He’s dead.”
The other guard began to open the door of Faria’s cell.
“Careful,” said the first guard.
Mr. Sinews groaned. “Careful?” he said, his voice bordering on hysteria. “What’s he going to do? Spring back to life and bite you?”
“Quiet,” the guard warned.
Mr. Sinews could only step back and wait, as the guards cautiously went into the old priest’s cell.
“Well?” he demanded.
“Well,” said the guard, “He’s dead alright.”
“We’ll be right back,” said the other guard. “You just stay right there.”
They both laughed as they abandoned Faria’s body on his bed.</Text>

            <Text>“We’ve glazed over the introductions already, but I’m afraid Mr. Tidkins missed them, and I believe we ought to enlighten one another with regards to our interest in Dr. Allen.” Parson gestured to Ocelot. “Mr. H.C. Ocelot,” he said.
“Do you know how I got these scars?” said Ocelot, in his booming voice, addressing the room.
A moment or two of uncomfortable silence passed, during which no one, not even Parson, dared to answer the question. It passed as rhetorical. Jonathan quietly sipped the sweet anise-flavoured liquor. Evidently the answer to his question was Dr. Allen.
“Mr. Edward Steen,” said Parson, gesturing to the man. “Once a policeman with Scotland Yard, Mr. Steen was unfortunately let go, due to…well, we won’t get into that, will we? What do you call your current profession, Mr. Steen?”
By way of answer, Steen merely held out a finger, directed it vaguely in the direction of Parson’s face, and fixed him with the most threatening of frowns that he could muster. He held that pose until Parson was finally forced to answer his own question.
“You’ve called yourself a ‘Consulting Detective,’ on many occasions, haven’t you? I must imagine that to be somewhat similar to the work you did as a police officer. Due to your thorough knowledge on the subject of criminal psychology, you are still called upon to act as civilian detective. Of course, you demand a sizeable fee for your efforts, so you are only called in for especially difficult cases that the police cannot handle on their own. Is that not correct?” Being not contradicted by anything other than Steen lowering his finger and swallowing the last of his glass of absinthe, a gesture which most likely indicated agreement, Sinews continued. “Given that you no longer operate as an official agent of the police, that prevents you from making arrests, but allows you to circumvent issues of jurisdiction that might otherwise hinder your investigation. Your roles involves dredging up evidence, in any way you can, even when that means fabricating it. Correct?”
Again, Steen made no contradiction but instead began to shout for the waiter to refill his cup, sparing no use of foul language.
“Mr. Steen also makes himself available as an expert witness in court, also for a price,” Parson told the rest of the company. “I would wager, however, that his interest in Dr. Allen is purely recreational and not by contract with the police. Am I right, Mr. Steen?”
Still, Steen's silent treatment continued, and Jonathan had to wonder if the man was even listening.
Finally, when his drink had been filled again, Steen broke his silence. “I worked the case of Jack The Ripper,” he said.
Parson grinned. “Come again?”
“I said I worked the case of Jack The Ripper,” he said, loudly, and stifling a belch.
“Jack The Ripper was never caught,” said Tidkins, “Capturing Allen, then…is your personal penance?”
Steen snorted. “I have my theories. We never caught the Ripper, but that don’t mean he got away, neither.”
Tidkins leaned forward. “Consider my interest piqued,” he said.
“Jack The Ripper weren’t no madman. He was a psychopath. And there’s a big difference between mad and psychopathic.”
“There is?”
“Jack The Ripper had the irresistible urge to kill. He couldn’t help himself. But he was clever, and he didn’t want to get caught. That’s why he picked his victims out of Whitechapel. Tarts.”
Mrs. Hatton gasped at the word, as if it was profane.
“Ladies of the night,” he amended, with a nod in her direction, “People who wouldn’t be too terribly missed when they went missing.”
“There were, if I am not mistaken,” said Jonathan, “A series of letters written by the ripper himself and sent to members of the police. One letter in particular, as I understand, contained one of the kidneys of the murdered women, the other kidney apparently having been fried and eaten by the killer. This does not strike me as the work of a man who wished to remain anonymous.”
“Don’t it?” said Steen, “Nah, I suppose it don’t. The truth is that most of the letters claiming to be from Jack The Ripper were fraudulent scribblings done by the media. See, they wanted to drum up interest in the case. Attention-seeking journalist scum—no offence, Mr. Grimmer.”
Jonathan blinked. “None taken,” he said.
“But the letter with the kidney,” said Tidkins.
“Well I’d guess that one were real, weren’t it? See, the Ripper, he didn’t want to be caught. But he did want to brag. He wanted the world to know what he’d done. Murderers of the psychopathic variety, they’re just like us in a lot of ways, believe it or not. They crave power, above all else. But unlike ordinary folks, what makes them feel powerful is murder. The power to end someone’s life. The power to inspire terror. And the power to get away with it.”
“But Jack The Ripper,” Tidkins persisted, “You claim he did not get away.”
“Yes, well, he never caught him, but like I said, he killed out of compulsion. And yet, after a series of increasingly brutal murders and an increasingly public profile, he just disappeared. Stopped killing. How do you think that happens? You think he just quit, just like that?”
“You liken murder to addiction, Mr. Steen.”
“Yes, Mr. Tidkins, I do.”
“So I suppose what you’re saying is that Anthony was arrested for some other crime, assault with sodomitic intent or theft or what have you, and was arrested—perhaps even hanged—without ever being suspected of his real crimes. He wasn’t caught for his murders, but he didn’t get away scot free either.”
“Precisely,” said Steen.
“Mrs. Hatton,” said Parson, promptly dropping his interest in Steen, much to Steen’s apparent chagrin.
“Well?” Steen interrupted.
“Mr. Steen, I have my own theories regarding the Ripper. Criminology is a hobby of mine, and the Ripper case is fascinating enough to have drawn my attention. I have given it considerable thought, and I cannot say that I agree with you, nor can your hypothesis be called original. Nonetheless your gift for criminal assessment and reasonable deduction may be useful in tracking down Dr. Tidkins. If I may, for the moment, persuade you to extend Mrs. Hatton the same courtesy as she has done for you, by sitting quietly and hearing her story, I would be much obliged.”
Parson smiled, and Steen begrudgingly quieted down.
“As you well know, gentlemen,” she said, fixing her gaze only on Parson, “I have ever been a victim of circumstance. And as you further know, society loves to blame the victim. I am not, as rumour would have you believe, a gold-digging murderess, intent on my husbands’ fortunes. But I have been abused with that notion; I have received every sort of punishment short of being locked away, for these crimes I am supposed to have committed. Outcast from popular society, my reputation utterly tarnished, I have become something of a pariah.”
Mrs. Hatton settled back into her chair until she was comfortable again, and returned her attention to her coffee, as if this backstory explained in any way at all her interest in Dr. Allen.
“Mrs. Hatton,” said Parson, coughing falsely. “You know what I always say. Honesty is a dreadful thing. One should never be honest. One should always be fanciful. The best things in life are always full of fancy. Still, just this once, I must ask you to be truthful. It is essential that we have all the facts.
“Mr. Sinews, I would never…”
“Please, Mrs. Hatton.”
She frowned. She stared at her coffee as if she hoped she might be able to drown herself in it to get out of this.
“We’ll come back to Mrs. Hatton,” said Parson. He turned to Jonathan. “Mr. Grimmer,” he began by way of introduction, “Is a reporter. His interest should therefore be obvious, but perhaps Mr. Grimmer can elaborate?”
“My interest is not with Dr. Allen, but with the whole of his organisation, The Resurrectionists,” he replied, “And with Lord Henry Connor, in particular.” He turned to the man in the plague doctor’s mask. “I have already informed the rest of this committee, that Lord Connor was murdered this evening, and there is every chance that I may be blamed.”
“Jonathan is quite innocent,” said Parson, “And believes that Connor’s murder had something to do with his apparent ties to the Society. He wishes to get to the bottom of it.”
“Thank you, Parson. Yes,” said Jonathan, staring daggers at the man. “That is about the sum of it. Whatever you may have on Dr. Allen and on the Resurrectionists as a whole, it may lead me to better understand Connor’s involvement.”
“If I might ask,” said Dr. Tidkins, “What makes you think that Connor was involved with Dr. Allen’s Society?”
Jonathan hesitated to mention the letters. He’d already given more information about himself than he’d intended. “I met his assassin,” he replied.
Tidkins replied in silence, blinking his blonde eyelashes with surprise.
Jonathan returned his attention to the drink in front of him. He took another sip, not paying it much attention, and discovered he’d already emptied his glass. He raised his hand for the waiter.
“And Mr. Tidkins, that leaves only you,” said Parson, turning his attention to the newcomer.
“Forgive me for contradicting you, Parson, but you have yet to explain your own interest in the matter. I should also inform you that we have in fact met before, although I can’t expect you to remember, given that I’ve not revealed my name or my face. Our first meeting was brief. It was in Paris. You and I had attended a performance of Hamlet and later happened to meet at the same gentleman’s club. You criticized the performance, calling it the most ‘singularly disappointing performance of Hamlet that you had ever had the displeasure of witnessing.’ I disagreed, calling you an impudent and ignorant swine, and informed you that you wouldn’t recognize a brilliant performance if it sprouted a cock and buggered you senseless.”
Mrs. Hatton nearly spilt her drink at that, as she made a show of pretending to faint.
Tidkins continued, while Jonathan supported the lady as she fluttered a silk fan in front of her face.
“Our second encounter was more recent but equally brief and just as infuriating. It was at the opera; I was not performing, of course, but attending as a member of the audience. Apparently an acquaintance of yours had spilt a glass of wine in your booth, and mistaking me for servant, you demanded that I clean up the spill. When I informed you that I was not working but attending the opera with my friends and associates, you insulted my wardrobe and offered me a couple of coins to clean the booth just the same.”
Parson smiled throughout the entirety of Dr. Tidkins' speech. When it was concluded, he replied, “Please forgive me, Mr. Tidkins. My memory increasingly fails me as I grow older. I’m terribly sorry to say that I have no recollection whatsoever of either incident, though I’m sure you have the right of it. That does indeed sound like the old me. I must tell you, however, that my manners have been greatly changed over the last few months. I’m sure you’ll find my manners considerably less—”
“Deplorable?” said Jonathan.
“Condescending,” Parson suggested, amiably.
“Mr. Sinews has met a woman,” Mrs. Hatton explained.
“Not just any woman, mind you,” Parson added.
“Love changes a man,” Mrs. Hatton said, “It is love, isn’t it, Parson? I can tell, just by looking at you, that you’ve changed. You’re less—”
“Smug,” Jonathan suggested.
“Sarcastic,” said Mrs. Hatton, “Less insincere.”
“Unfortunately,” Parson admitted, “Yes. It is love.”
“Unfortunately?” Mrs. Hatton exclaimed. “What is that supposed to mean, exactly?”
The waiter finally arrived. After filling Jonathan’s glass half full with absinthe, he placed a cube of sugar onto the perforated spoon atop the glass and slowly filled the rest of the glass with ice cold water, allowing the sugar to dissolve into the drink as he poured. When he finished, Mr. Steen shouted for him to do the same with his own glass.
“I’m all for romance,” said Parson, “It’s love I’m against. Love makes moths of us all. None are safe from its flames.”
“Yes, yes,” Mrs. Hatton murmured, “And we are all bound to get burned. Poppycock. You haven’t lived if you haven’t loved, I say.”
“Whatever your romantic or philosophical inclinations,” said Parson, “My point is that love is not a choice. It is a feeling, and one that is impossible to ignore, whether you’d want to or not. At any rate, Mr. Tidkins, to answer your question, my interest is purely recreational. You see, I consider myself a sort of collector.”
“What sort?”
“Much like our friend the detective,” Parson indicated Mr. Steen, who had already swallowed the best of his newly filled glass of absinthe, and who objected to Parson’s use of the word ‘friend’ to describe their relationship, “I have a fascination with mysteries, though I have little interest in the literary sort. I prefer true stories. Any mystery will do, so long as it is particularly perplexing, sufficiently bizarre, and above all -”
“Grotesque,” Jonathan finished.
“Quite right,” said Parson, and he muttered, “Though I wish you would give me leave to finish my own sentences.”
Jonathan shrugged. He was happy, so long as he was getting under Parson’s skin.
“The world craves the grotesque,” said Parson. “That’s why we’re here, really. All of us. Despite what we might claim. That we wish to vindicate ourselves of accusations of murder; that we are pursuing a quest for vengeance; that we are investigating a crime as a consulting detective. The truth of our interests could not be more plain. We share an interest in the morbid, the grotesque, the macabre.”
Mrs. Hatton harrumphed at this suggestion.
“Really, Mrs. Hatton, of everyone here, you would be the last person I would expect to be squeamish when it comes to talking about murder. After all, I would guess that you’re the only one here who has actually killed someone.”
All eyes turned to the lady in question, who looked like she might faint again.
“This innocent dove?” Edward Steen laughed.
“Marianne Hatton may look to be an innocent dove, Mr. Steen, but I assure you she has killed, and with her bare hands. Some thirty years ago she spied on behalf of the British government. She has given up the trade since then, and changed her name, but I assure you, Mrs. Hatton may very well be the most dangerous person in this room.”
Everyone continued to look to her to correct him, to deny his claims, but she did not. In fact, her posture shifted, her demeanour changed. Her entire personality seemed to melt away, until it was possible to see the former spy within the costume of the matronly widow.
“Whatever you may say, Parson, I shudder to think that your disposition has been improved by the love of a woman. What sort of man does that imply you must have been previous to the amelioration?”
“You find me cynical, Mr. Tidkins?” Parson asked.
“Disgustingly so.”
“On the contrary,” Parson argued, “I am quite optimistic. I have the utmost faith that we will find exactly what we are looking for."
“Death, grotesqueness, and morbidity, you mean?” muttered Tidkins.
“In abundance,” he said.</Text>

            <Text>A few moments later, the guards returned with a large black bag, into which they unceremoniously shoved Faria’s body.
“Well,” said the first guard. “What now? Toss him out to sea?”
“Suppose we’d best ask,” said the second.
When they’d gone again, locking the cell as if they still expected him to wake, Mr. Sinews was quick to act, in spite of his grief at the loss of his friend.
He slid open the food slot in his own door and with the ease that comes with practice, slid himself through the narrow opening and into the hall. A few moments later, he was in Faria’s own cell, standing over the body of his friend.
“I’m sorry, old man,” he said, as he pulled the man’s body out of the bag.
Quickly, and in spite of his great affection for the man, roughly, he climbed out of the cell the way he’d come in, dragging Faria’s body with him.
Again, he crawled back into his own cell, bringing the priest with him. Pulling the sheets from his bed, he picked up the body of his friend, which had gotten impossibly light with his sickness and malnourishment, and placed him into the bed. He covered the priest’s body with his sheets, and hurried back out of his cell, just as he heard the guards voices resounding from around the corner.
Rushing now, he crawled back into Faria’s cell, pushed himself through it more quickly than he’d ever done, and scrambled to grab the parachute from under the bed as the voices rounded the corner and approached the cell.
He climbed into the body bag, taking the parachute with him, sealing himself into darkness and the smell of death.
He heard footsteps drawing nearer, the jangling of keys, the creak of a metal door seldom opened, the voices of the guards, and then, he felt their rough hands groping him. He reminded himself to be perfectly still, as they lifted him and carried him out of the room.</Text>

            <Title>Scene 9</Title>
            <Text>Annabel slipped silently into the revolving ballroom, apparently still unnoticed despite the drama that had unfolded upstairs. The dance continued. The musicians still played, the ladies and gentlemen continued to waltz, or to stand on the sidelines and clap politely when the dance ended. But somehow the atmosphere had changed, subtly. At first, Annabel could not mark what that change was, but eventually she discovered what had set her on edge.
There were, spread out through the crowd as if not to dispel their association to one another, a group of gentlemen, identically dressed and masked. They wore black, and their masks were of plain, worn leather, shaped like the heads of corvine birds. Not the sort of mask one wore to a masquerade. One such mask, on its own, might not have caused much alarm. But there were dozens of these masks, spread out through the crowd. It was enough to send a chill crawling up her spine.
The men moved with purpose, their heads turning from side to side, searching through the crowd, looking for…
Connor, she supposed.
Something Mr. O had said ran through her head. She’d dismissed it at the time as the ravings of a man trying to save his own skin. But now she wondered if there might be something more to it. He’d said that Connor was dangerous, that he had dangerous friends. Her eyes flicked from one mask to another, watching as the men weaved through the crowd. Were these Connor’s dangerous friends?
And if so, she thought, beginning to look for a way out of the ballroom that wouldn’t cross paths with them, how long until they found Connor’s body? Or, she thought with increasing panic, if they’d already discovered it, they might be looking for his killer. If she’d been seen fleeing Connor’s study, they might be looking for her.
She couldn’t help but think of an old friend of hers. Jack Bernhardt, a man she’d once known, had often worn a plague doctor’s mask, not unlike the ones on the faces of these ominous gentlemen working their way through the ballroom. She’d lost touch with him, years ago, but she still thought of him from time to time. And then, when a group of scientists known as Resurrectionists became the talk of the town, Annabel had thought of Jack.
She looked now at one of the crow-headed men, taking care not to let him see that she was watching him. The Resurrectionists were reputed to don plague masks to protect their identities. Their scientific methods, Annabel recalled, were radically controversial, bordering on criminal. A few years back, a gruesome killing spree was reputed to be the work of one of their members. Dangerous friends indeed, Annabel thought.
She casually scouted out her exit route. There were two of the crow-faced gentlemen between her and the door. She would have to circle around to make her way past them. Like her, they were moving through the crowd, slowly, careful not to be observed. Trying to make their movements look casual, appearing to socialize as they threaded through the partygoers. The more she watched them, the more obvious it became that they weren’t here as a social outing.
One of them was headed her way. He turned his head towards her, but Annabel was quick to turn away.
She stepped onto the dance floor, taking the arm of a pretty young lady as she went. The girl yelped in surprised delight; she might have had one too many glasses of rum punch. The dance was fast-paced. Annabel had made a study of waltzes, but she hadn’t grown up in high society. It was still foreign to her, and she hadn’t bothered learning the male parts. She stumbled her way through the dance, which seemed to involve trading partners. She watched her fellow dancers and followed their lead, spinning the young lady and holding out her arm to allow a new partner to take her place. But as her new partner stepped into the young lady’s place, Annabel found herself face to face with a tall gentleman in a black suit.
“Good evening,” he said, pressing something cold and hard against her chest.
She looked up to see that he wore the crow’s head mask. She stared daggers at him, but allowed him to lead her from the revolving dance floor. He ushered her, without a word, into an unoccupied corner of the room, where he pushed her roughly against the wall so that she was hidden from prying eyes by his tall frame.
“Don’t move,” he instructed. She saw now that it was a gun that he’d pressed against her body, and though she could be quick to draw her weapon, she was not that quick, and his grip was strong. She had to assume that he did not want to shoot her in front of this large group of witnesses, so at least she had that advantage. “Now slowly, hand it over.”
“What?” she said, genuinely confused. She’d assumed he was just going to try to kill her. She hadn’t anticipated him making other demands.
He cocked his weapon.
“Do not make the mistake of thinking I won’t shoot you, here and now. The package,” he said. “You do have it, do you not? From Lord Connor’s safe…”
How in the hell did he know about that? Unless…
“You,” she muttered. “You’re the buyer.”
For the benefit of her buyers’ confidentiality and for her own, Annabel made her arrangements through a third party. They never met face to face. So how in the hell did he know who she was? Especially since she was in disguise…
She’d been sold out, she thought bitterly.
“Not me specifically, but yes, we’re the buyers,” he admitted. “Now, hand it over.”
She withdrew the package, which she’d slipped into a pocket sewn inside her vest. He reached out to take it, but she held it back, out of his grasp.
“Connor tried to kill me,” she told him, merely to gauge his reaction. She could only see his eyes, but he didn’t even blink at the revelation. “He was sick,” she pressed. “Maddened.”
The man pressed the gun harder against her chest. She gritted her teeth determined not to cry out in pain, but she suspected it would leave a bruise.
“Enough. The package, that’s all we want.”
“Did you know he would be sick?” she demanded, defiantly setting her jaw and refusing to acknowledge the gun shoved against her ribs. “If I’d known how dangerous this would prove to be, I’d have charged more for the item in question. Is that why our mutual friend didn’t warn me?” she asked, referring to the third party, who’d let her know there was a buyer interested in Connor’s safe. “You know, I could have been killed, infected.”
The man only smiled. She knew it only from the way his mask shifted on his face as he grinned, and from the crinkled lines in the corner of his eyes. It was a malicious smile.
“Don’t sell yourself short,” he said. “We know who you are. You think one zombie alone was going to stop you?”
She smiled back.
“Zombie?” she said. “Is that what Connor’s sickness was?”
With deft hands, as casually as running a hand through her hair, she reached up and pressed a button on her eyepiece. There were a few quick clicks and whirs, the hiss of air releasing, and a blur of motion from her eyepiece. A moment later, the man fell to his knees, a dart sticking out of his neck. His eyes were wild, unfocused.
“What?” he said, confused. “What did you do to me?”
She bent down and whispered in his ear, “You’re right. I shouldn’t sell myself short.”
She stood and walked away, stepping back onto the revolving floor and disappearing once more into the crowd, while the two crow-headed men who had been barring her path hurried over to investigate their fallen comrade, leaving her exit unguarded. Just as she was about to make her escape, she heard some commotion from upstairs. It must have been coming from Lord Connor’s office, judging by the sound. She immediately thought of Mr. O.
She hesitated. She could still help him. He was clearly in trouble. But he wasn’t really her problem any more, even if it was sort of her fault. Of course, if he’d been first into Connor’s office, he’d have been the one to have faced Connor in all his sickness-induced cannibalistic glory. And they both knew how that would have turned out. So, no, she’d done enough for Mr. O already. And she still had herself to worry about.
She turned away. The crow-faced men had already removed the dart from the man’s neck, and though he still looked dazed, he was pointing in her direction, and two of them were headed her way. She spun around, headed for the door, but a third barred her path. He was right in front of her.
No time for subtlety. Without warning, she struck him across the face. He flew backward, landed hard and laid still. His mask tumbled off his face with the clasps torn clean off, and she stepped over him. She spared a quick glance to see if she might recognise him, but she didn’t. The way cleared for her. Ladies and gentlemen alike scrambled out of her way.
“Stop him!” someone cried, “Stop that ruffian!”
The crow-men were hard on her heels, pushing roughly through the crowd. As the hallway cleared, the thinning crowd revealed more of them blocking her path. How many of these damned Resurrectionists were there?
“Get out of my way!” she shouted, whipping her revolver from her belt.
“Hand it over,” he said, “And we’ll let you live.”
She felt cold steel against her back. She froze.
“Lower your gun, slowly,” said the voice behind her. There was something familiar in the cadence of this man’s voice, but it was muffled by the mask, and she couldn’t place it. Still, she felt certain that she knew this man.
She lowered the gun, shoved it into its holster.
“The package,” he instructed. “No sudden moves.”
She nodded, slowly. She bit her lip in frustration. She was practically trembling with helpless rage, as she reached inside her vest pocket. She looked out into the sea of faces. Most were masked, though many had lowered their masks. Pressed against the wall in fear, the gentlemen had their arms wrapped protectively around their ladies. Even amongst the crowd, she was helpless. No one here would risk intervening.
Annabel reached into her pocket and withdrew the small yellow envelope she’d taken from Connor’s safe. Until now, she hadn’t given much thought to what it contained. A diamond necklace, a family heirloom, an artifact from a foreign land—these were the kinds of things Annabel was accustomed to stealing. But this was something different, its value measured not by the number of diamonds it contained or by the karat of the gold, but by the significance it held for the would-be buyer. Whatever it was, it had driven them to desperate measures to ensure they received it. She held out the envelope, and it was immediately snatched away by the plague doctor.
“What now?” she asked.
He handed her an envelope in return. “Your payment,” he explained.
She was surprised. She hadn’t expected they would still pay her, after all this, but she supposed they wouldn’t want her trying to track them down. Easier to appease her with a wad of cash.
The man in the plague mask didn’t wait to open the envelope, but immediately began tearing open the package. Annabel lingered, watching intently as he reached into the envelope. Straw spilled out of the envelope; it must have been used to pack the item. It must have been fragile. At last, he withdrew his hand, the item enclosed in his fist. He opened it. A small glass vial sat on his palm, filled with murky green fluid. All this fuss for something so small, so seemingly insignificant. It almost looked like a vial of absinthe, but Annabel knew it could be nothing quite so mundane.
Another one of the men in the plague masks came up behind him, and he handed over the empty package, in exchange for a large mechanical bird. The bird was a brass-winged raven, its mechanical components half-hidden beneath black feathers that had been glued to it. Like a wind-up doll, the bird had a key on its back, which the plague doctor began to wind, causing the bird to spring to life. It fluttered its wings, and spun its head. The craftsmanship reminded Annabel of her own clockwork eye.
A hole in the raven’s back, just beneath the key, was the perfect fit for the glass vial. The plague doctor slid the vial into it, and pressed a hidden button, causing a hidden panel to slide shut over the hole. He gave the key another turn, and opened his hand. At once, the raven took off, winging above the crowd.
The sound of mechanical wings and hissing gas resounded through the stunned silence of the ballroom. A cloud of green and yellow gas trailed behind the clockwork crow. It spread quickly as the raven circled the ballroom, filling the room with a yellowish green haze. As it dispersed, it disappeared into the air, becoming invisible.
Annabel tried not to breathe. She covered her mouth with her sleeve and ran. She couldn’t be sure she hadn’t inhaled whatever vapours he’d released, but she prayed she hadn’t.
The plague doctor stepped aside to let her pass, but by the time she reached the door, her lungs were aching. When she finally allowed herself to breathe, the air smelt of death.</Text>
            <Comments>Is she concerned that they are after her because she killed Connor?  It sounds like she is seeing the Resurrectionists just as they are arriving.  Did someone else hear the gunshot?  If these are thoughts going through her mind, let the reader know.

You think? Is she famous? Maybe past history come to light?
Would she know the dances from the male part? Maybe stumble through and get noticed that way?

I thought she was robbing for fun? I would make this more prevalent in the beginning of the book. If you did, readers may need a reminder. :)

Change this: As suggested, Miss Monday is no longer a “thief for hire.” She’s just a thief. Sometimes her sources give her a head’s up when there’s a “product” they’re interested in acquiring; she’ll then lift the product and make arrangements to sell it. Otherwise, she’ll steal things and then find a buyer. In the case of the item in Connor’s safe, she was tipped off that there was an interested buyer.
Maybe suspect that it would leave a bruise.
Did the perfume spray in her face? Was the perfume sprayed a few times? Did all the guys have the perfume bottle? I’m not sure how far away the guy is from her to spray it. This would be something to clarify.</Comments>

He eventually realises that she is telling the truth when she says she only killed Connor in self-defence, and that Connor was sick. He still believes the Society of Immortals was involved, and he worries that she may be in danger. He tells her about the meeting at the Moirae Café and about his suspicions about Lord Connor’s involvement in the Society of Immortals. He suspects that Connor may have been trying to leave the Society and that they were trying to kill one of their own members, and the name of Miss Monday’s contact presents further proof that the Society hired her to steal from one of their own. This could be ground-breaking news, and he wants to know more about Miss Monday’s part in it. He asks her to meet at his office.
1898—To Mr. O’s surprise, Miss Monday agrees to meet him at the Agency—what he doesn’t know is that she once worked for Dr. Tidkins, a member of the Society of Immortals. As a result of that engagement she lost her eye and her arm to the Lazarus Virus, and while Tidkins replaced her missing limb and eye with prosthetics, he offered no explanation or apology and disappeared without a trace.

The “recording device” on one of the Lazarus victims by the Thames. The mutated insects, which have been introduced to more than just Lazarus.
1898—Monday and O finally manage to catch up to Dr. Tidkins, where they learn that Tidkins believes that the pair of them may have some immunity to Lazarus. He believes he is close to finding a cure, but in order to test it, he has had to unleash Lazarus on London. The Society believes that some people may show a certain resistance to the plague; understanding this resistance is key to finding a cure. What Mr. O and Miss Monday don’t realise is that Tidkins has already released Lazarus.
1901—Parson Sinews escapes the Prison of Secrets and seeks to discover why he was sent there in the first place.
1901—Roderick Steen is hired by the government to find and capture Mr. Sinews—who he at first believes is Dr. Allen. 
1901—Steen eventually uncovers a conspiracy that runs deep through the British government. The Society of Immortals has promised immortality to Queen Victoria herself and to the upper echelons of British society; in return, the Society’s activities are sanctioned by the corrupt government. Dr. Allen’s murders, the unleashing of the Lazarus Virus—all were sanctioned by the government in exchange for eternal life. Queen Victoria in reality died in 1901, but in this alternate history, her life may be spared by the Lazarus Virus and its cure.</Text>

            <Title>Scene</Title>
            <Text>Avery Vane was seated comfortably on the divan, puffing white rings of smoke from his cigarette, when the knock came at the door. He dashed out the butt of his smoke, and wiping his hands on his handkerchief, got out of his seat. He moved over to the door, and waited there for his butler to announce who was calling. To his surprise, it was not his butler that he met in the den, but the doctor.
Avery’s butler trailed behind the doctor, spewing apologies. “I’m sorry, sir. I’m afraid he rather insisted.”
“That’s fine, Mr. Duncan, I’ll see the doctor in the den. If you could start a fire, I felt a cold breeze sweep into the room when the door opened,” said Avery.
He probably sounded more at ease than he felt. The cigarette might have helped with that.
He turned to his guest. “To what do I owe the pleasure, Dr. Allen?”
“Pleasure?” Dr. Allen repeated. “I’m afraid you will derive no pleasure from this visit.”
The doctor, according to habit, where a black leather mask, in the old-fashioned style of plague doctors. Mr. Vane had yet to ascertain the reason for the strange accoutrement, but frankly, he found the mask unsettling. Not once had he seen the doctor’s face. The doctor’s voice was muffled, almost to the point of being incomprehensible. Avery had once noticed a small vent on the underside of the mask, through which he could hear the doctor’s ragged breath.
“This is my apprentice,” he said.
Avery blinked. Apprentice?
He hadn’t noticed the young boy, who now stepped out from behind the doctor. The boy, although unmasked, was equally frightening to look at. His skin was so pale, it was practically translucent. His hair was white. Not blonde, but white, as stark as snow. His eyes were a soft pink, his lashes as pale as his hair. Avery had never seen anyone like him, in all his years.
“How do you do?” he managed.
He hoped it sounded polite. It wasn’t like Avery to stare. He’d been raised according to a strict set of manners. He could just imagine his mother rapping his knuckles with an ash branch for how he was staring at the little albino.
But it wasn’t just the boy’s pale pallor that disturbed Avery. There was something in his expression. Something unsettling. Perhaps it was just the boy’s pink eyes that prejudiced Vane against the unfortunate youth, but Avery believed he saw hatred in those eyes. Cold, calculating hatred. Avery forced a smile.
He realized that the doctor had not yet answered his question. He sat back down in the den, fished out another cigarette, and lit it nervously. He gestured to the empty chairs.
“Can I offer you anything, doctor? Tea, or perhaps something stronger?”
“We won’t be staying long,” the doctor answered.
Neither he, nor the boy, had taken a seat. Instead, they stood at the threshold of the den. Strangely, Avery felt cornered, like a caged animal. It was ridiculous of him to be so intimidated by the old doctor and the young boy who trailed behind him. Surely if they wanted to hurt him, he could fight them off. The boy looked as frail as a ghost, and the doctor, judging by his voice, was well past his prime. Avery, meanwhile, was in his twenties, was tall, and athletic. If need be, he could call for help, and a dozen servants would be with him in a minute. And yet…
“What do you want?” he asked. He was disappointed with how himself. He’d meant to sound forceful, confident. Instead, his voice trembled and cracked.
“Come with us,” the doctor replied.
“No,” said Avery.
“This will all go much more smoothly if you do as I say, Mr. Vane.”
“No,” he said again. His voice was softer this time, barely more than a whisper. His lips trembled.
“Mr. Vane, it is really not my style to adopt such an unsavoury practice as blackmail, but I’m afraid I really must insist that you come with me at once. Otherwise—”
The doctor didn’t need to finish that sentence. Avery knew exactly what the doctor held over him. If his secret got out, Avery would be ruined. Not merely ruined. Utterly destroyed. The way Avery saw it, he had only two options. He could go along with the doctor. Or he could put a bullet in the doctor’s skull. He’d have to kill the child too. He didn’t like the thought of killing a child. But he was tired of letting the doctor intimidate him.
He drew his pistol. He wished he could see the look on the doctor’s face. The sudden transition from arrogance to fear. The doctor raised his arms as if to plead for his life, and took a step back. Avery readied the pistol, aimed it at the doctor’s chest.
“Hyde,” said the doctor.
Avery blinked. What?
Then he felt one enormous hand engulfing his skull. He felt himself being whirled around like a rag doll. The pistol fell to the floor with a clatter, and Avery found himself face to face with Death.
The man—if he was a man at all—wore a weathered black plague mask, like the doctor’s, only much larger. He was dressed in a black cowl. He was also the biggest man Avery had seen in his life. Without a word, he lifted Avery off his feet with one hand, by his hair. Avery felt strands of hair rip from his scalp. He screamed.
Then, with what seemed like no effort at all, the giant flung Avery across the room. He crashed into the settee, landed hard on the floor, and lay there. Unable to move, he stared at the ceiling.
No one had come to his rescue. Avery began to wonder if his servants were even still alive.
“Well done, Mr. Hyde,” said the doctor.
The albino child hunched over Avery. His pale white face was all Avery could see.
“Help me,” he wheezed. “Please. Run and call for help.”
The boy smiled. For a moment, Avery thought that the boy was going to do as he asked. Then the boy opened his mouth and let a big ball of spit spill out onto Avery’s forehead. Avery groaned.
The boy smiled at his handiwork. Then he began to kick Avery. He wasn’t terribly strong, but Avery couldn’t move at all. He believed his ribs had been broken in the fall, and each kick made him wince with pain. Eventually, he lost consciousness.</Text>

            <Title>Scene Three</Title>
            <Synopsis>Roderick Steen escapes into the Moirae Tea House with Bailey. He has a conversation with Clotho.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Roderick stumbled through the entrance as the door swung open. He staggered to a stop.
“Quickly,” he shouted. “The door!”
The door slammed shut, and Bailey practically leapt into Roderick’s arms. Roderick blinked in surprise, but he patted the dog affectionately. The dog seemed to be more shaken by the ordeal than even Roderick, who went immediately to the window and peered through the curtain into the darkness.
He couldn’t see them any more. The alley was too dark. But he knew they were out there.
“What’s going on?” said whoever it was that had opened the door.
“My apologies,” said Roderick, still breathing hard. Politeness did not come easily to Roderick, but he dared not offend his hosts. The last thing he wanted was to be tossed out. “I hate to come barging in here like this, at such a late hour.”
He took a quick look around as his host—or hosts rather, as he now saw that there were three of them—began to turn the lights on. He must have woken them, as the wicks had all been snuffed out, and they were dressed in robes.
The several tables, chairs and divans, candles and oil lamps upon the tables, as well as the cash register upon the counter, marked this as a place of business, rather than a home, although he guessed that his hosts also lived here. Perhaps there were bedrooms upstairs.
“Please, just give me a few minutes and I’ll be out of your hair. It’s just that, well, I was accosted by…hmm, I don’t suppose you’d believe me if I told you what they were.”
“The walking dead men outside, eh?” asked one of them.
Roderick blinked in surprise. “I’m sorry. What did you say?”
“Clotho!” the one in the black robe snapped. Her voice was harsh and cold.
The third of their company seemed to have finished lighting the oil lamps and candles on the tables, and Roderick’s eyes were beginning to adjust. Finally, he spotted the little wooden sign, which announced the name of the establishment.
The Moirae Tea House. Beneath the name of the tea house, the sign declared: Have Your Fortune Read By The Goddesses Of Fate. Tea, Pastries, and Divination.
Interesting, he thought. He must have taken a wrong turn somewhere. In all his years in this city, in all of his walks with Bailey, he’d never seen this place before.
“What did you say?” he said again, turning away from the sign and back to the one called Clotho.
“Apologies for our sister,” said the one who’d scolded her. “Cup of tea?”
“It’s late,” said Roderick. “I don’t wish to impose,” he said. “I simply lost my bearings and found myself in a dark and apparently dangerous alley. Perhaps they’re gone by now.”
He headed to the window again, but it was too dark to see anything. They could still be out there.
“Nonsense,” said the one in the black, moth-eaten robe. “We get so few customers as it is. It would be our pleasure. A drink, on the house.”
Roderick relented, not just for his own sake, but for Bailey’s. The dog was still shaking, and he really couldn’t be sure the undead were not still out there, waiting, hungry, for something larger than a rat to come their way.
Taking one more look through the window and seeing nothing but his own reflection in the glass, he took a seat at one of the tables. While the other two began to brew his cup of tea, Clotho took the seat opposite him.
Like her sister, Clotho wore a white robe, its hood pulled up over her head. Most of her face was hidden within the folds of her hood, but what he could see of it was surprisingly ancient. He caught glimpses of wrinkles and eyes pale and grey with cataracts. Her lips were dry and chapped. Her teeth, yellow and beginning to rot. Despite that, she moved easily, without the stiffness that one would ordinarily associate with advanced age.
She smiled.
“He was here,” she whispered, setting her hand on the table. Like her face, it was wrinkled and spotted with blemishes.
“Who?” said Roderick.
She looked back to see that her sisters were otherwise occupied. Then she answered. “The man you’re looking for.”
“I’m sorry?” Roderick replied. “Who am I looking for?”
“You’re a detective, aren’t you?” she whispered. “You’re supposed to figure that out.”
“How did you…” he began, but Clotho merely pointed at the sign as reply. Divination, he read. Roderick snorted. He didn’t believe in such fanciful things. As always, his mind inclined toward the scientific. Still, how did she know his occupation? Deduction perhaps.
“You seek Lord Connor’s murderer.”
Alright, now Roderick was impressed. He looked at her in amazement. And suspicion. Still, he had to assume that like him, this elderly woman was an expert in deduction; she merely used her talent to create the illusion of divination.
“You seek the Resurrection Man,” she continued. Grinning. Her smile like the blade of a sickle. “Anthony Tidkins.”
As she spoke, a spider crawled across her hand, but she seemed not to notice. He wanted to brush the spider off her hand or at least alert her to its presence, but he had the notion that she knew it was there but that it didn’t bother her. What disturbed him was not the spider itself but Clotho’s seeming indifference to its presence. As he watched the thing crawling about her hand on its spindly legs, he began to feel the phantom itch of spiders walking across his own skin.
Bailey continued to shake in his arms, and Roderick was beginning to suspect that the dog’s nervousness was not merely due to the shock of their encounter with the dead men in the alleyway.
“Anthony Tidkins,” Roderick repeated, mulling over the name. The Resurrection Man was a figure in The Mysteries of London, a penny dreadful. Anthony Tidkins was therefore likely to be a member of the Resurrectionists; that clandestine organisation often took the names of penny dreadful figures as their own.
Clotho looked meaningfully at her sisters, who were still busy preparing the tea, then back at Roderick again, silently signalling that they might not be inclined to let her share her knowledge.
He nodded. “What about Dr. Allen?” he asked, keeping his voice low.
“I think you already know,” said Clotho, quietly, “That Dr. Allen had nothing to do with Lord Connor’s death, except as a scapegoat.”
“So why the coverup? Why make Connor’s death look like the work of Dr. Allen?”
Clotho grinned toothily. “Which reason should I give you?” she asked. “There are many.”
“Pick one,” said Roderick.
“Believability,” Clotho replied. “It’s an easy enough lie to sell, isn’t it? After all, Dr. Allen’s supposed crimes are well known.”
Roderick considered her phrasing. Supposed crimes. As if to suggest that Dr. Allen’s crimes were, what, not crimes at all? Or that he’d been framed for those murders as well?
His hostess leaned across the table to whisper more quietly to him. Her sisters were still distracted by their task, though the smell of tea was beginning to fill the air.
“Fate,” Clotho whispered, her voice a rasping, grating sound. “Fate is a fickle path, easily altered by the slightest word or the gentlest nudge. I may have said too much already, but the truth is that you’re taking too long to figure this out on your own. Time is running out, Mr. Steen, and you’re not yet where you’re supposed to be. Still, you need to solve this on your own, to the best of your ability, with as little help from us as possible.”
He didn’t recall having introduced himself, but he really shouldn’t have been surprised that she knew his name.
Suddenly she reached out, put her hand against his shoulder, and looked him in the eyes. Her face, unmasked by the darkness of her hood, was terrifying. A spider crawled across the whites of her eye, but she didn’t blink or flinch or seem to notice at all. There were deep lines that creased her face, not wrinkles but cracks in her skin. The constant sickle-like smile on her face melted into a sneer.
“Do you think you can?” she asked, an urgency in her voice.
He nodded. He had every confidence in his ability to solve this mystery, but wherever Clotho got her information—whether she really possessed some clairvoyant ability or whether she had a network of spies planted throughout the city—she had suddenly become his biggest lead. If she wouldn’t say more, it would be difficult. Not that Roderick lamented a challenge, but still.
“Connor was already dead when Anthony Tidkins strung him up in the fashion of a Dr. Allen victim,” she said at last. “But you knew that already, didn’t you?”
Roderick nodded. The spider on Clotho’s hand dropped onto the table and began to crawl across it towards him. He resisted the impulse to flatten it with the palm of his hand.
Roderick recounted his findings. “Lord Connor was killed by a gunshot to the head, most likely in self defense—not by this Anthony Tidkins, I would wager. I believe Connor to have been infected by the same strange disease as that which afflicted the so-called ‘walking dead men’ outside. It is a disease, isn’t it?”
Disease was the only logical conclusion Roderick could come to, and Roderick was nothing if not logical. It had to be disease that had created these vampires, for lack of a better word. Roderick wasn’t superstitious, but he couldn’t deny that he’d seen the dead return to life. Still, was that what was happening here? A plague of the undead?
“After Connor’s ultimate death, somebody—presumably this Anthony Tidkins character—returned to the scene in order to cover up what had happened to him. But why? And how did Connor come to his condition? What was he?” He repeated the word he’d been thinking of, to his mysterious hostess. “A vampire?”
Clotho grinned. “Not exactly,” she said, “But I suppose that’s a close enough assessment of his condition.”
Roderick considered this. If this were true, then what of the gentleman who’d slain him? Nobody ordinary. Someone with experience in dealing with vampires, perhaps. Someone, well, more accurately, two someones, as there had been two gentlemen seen entering Connor’s office.
Still, more important than the vampire slayers was the man who’d infected Connor in the first place. Anthony Tidkins, perhaps? Was it also safe to assume that Tidkins must be a vampire as well? Was that how this affliction worked? And again, Roderick had to wonder if he really could believe in vampires, even if it was with the assumption that the condition was caused by infection.
Roderick turned his thoughts to something else.
“The crow’s head,” said Clotho, as if reading his mind. He wasn’t entirely sure that she wasn’t.
He nodded. “What about it?” he asked. “What does it mean?”
“It’s the symbol for The Resurrectionists,” she said.
“That much I know,” he said. “But what are they? I know their reputation, and I know their stories. But…what are they? Vampires?”
“They wish,” said Clotho. “Do you know the other name for The Resurrectionists?”
When he failed to come up with an answer, she whispered it to him. “The Murder Society.”
It would almost be funny, if it weren’t so macabre. “As in a murder of crows,” he said wryly. “I thought you weren’t going to tell me any more?”
He caught a glimpse of a smile on Clotho’s face, still hidden by her cowl. The spider made its way across the table, slowly making its way toward Roderick’s hand. Another spider dangled from the sleeve of Clotho’s robe. Another still, was crawling upon her chest. They were all over her.
“As I said before, you’re already on the right path. I’m not giving you answers, really. Just confirming what you already suspect. You suspect that it was Anthony Tidkins that turned Connor. You’re right in your suspicions. As to your other question—the why—I’ll leave that for you to discover.”</Text>
            <Notes>Delete this scene. Instead, add a scene in which Dr. Mircalla Karnstein arrives in a hansom, shoots the closest zombie, and orders Roderick to “get in.”

Claiming to be acting on behalf of the queen, she says that she has been looking for Roderick because the police cannot be trusted, nor can the queen’s agents. She offers to hire him, explains a few things that might otherwise have been explained by the Moirae in deleted scenes. She should direct his suspicions towards Annabel and Mr. O while remaining innocent as far as the reader is concerned (only in the sequel will her villainy be revealed). Make her seem like a capable new ally.

Roderick should then be summoned to another murder site, at The Melbourne Club. Karnstein can drop him off there or just let him know that he’s been summoned. </Notes>

There was a knock at the door.
“Now, who could that be?” said Atropos.
“Go and see,” said Lachesis.
“Could be a customer,” said Clotho.
“At this hour?” said Atropos, “Idiot.”
Clotho frowned. “Well, it could be,” she said.
“Won’t somebody answer the door?” asked Lachesis.
“You answer it,” Clotho whined, “I always answer it.”
“Idiots,” Atropos growled, sweeping away from them and heading toward the door.
“What’s she so upset about?” asked Clotho.
Lachesis shrugged.
The door swung open, bells jingling.
“We were wondering when we’d see you again,” said Atropos.
“Who is it?” Clotho demanded. She moved along the shadows in the room, toward the door.
“Why were you wondering? Could you not simply look into the future and see?” asked Parson Sinews.
“We could have,” said Atropos, “But why ruin the surprise? Won’t you come inside?”
She stepped aside so he could enter the tea house. He stepped inside and allowed the door to close behind him. Atropos pulled a chair out for him and sat down.
“Lachesis, grab our guest a bottle of absinthe, won’t you?” she said, “And perhaps some food. He looks practically starved to death.”
“Thank you,” he said graciously.
“Hm,” said his host, “Such manners. You’ve changed, Mr. Sinews.”
“I have,” he admitted.
“What brings you back here, after all this time, Mr. Sinews?” asked Lachesis, pouring a glass of absinthe for him. He drank greedily from it like a child being given his first glass of liquor.
“I won’t take much of your time,” he told her.
“You haven’t given up your quest for vengeance,” said Lachesis, “After all this time.”
“Of course he hasn’t,” said Clotho, “Vengeance is sweet.”
“No,” said Mr. Sinews without any of his former charm or grace, “I have not. And I can’t. Not now. Not after all that’s happened.”
Atropos refilled his drink and slid it back across the table to him. “What do you need us to do?” she asked, uncommonly gently.
“You mentioned something about a recipe.”
He drank the second glass of absinthe, more quickly than he ought to have. After all this time without it, he could hardly recall how potent alcohol could be, and he wasn’t quite sure he cared, either. Right now, freedom tasted of anise.
Clotho grinned, ear to ear at the mention of the recipe.
“Oh,” she said, looking at her elder sister. “Can we? Can we really?”
“Fine,” said Atropos. She looked at Mr. Sinews sternly. “We won’t kill them for you,” she said, “But we can give you the means to find them.”
“How does it work?” he asked.
“Clotho.”
“Yes,” said Clotho, taking a seat at the table across from Mr. Sinews and taking a swig of absinthe straight from the bottle. “It’s simple,” she said, stifling a belch, “You just need three things.”
She slid the bottle back to him, and he topped off his glass once more.
“The first,” she said, “Is leeches.”
“Leeches,” he repeated.
“Yes,” she said, “But they’ll have to be filled to their bursting point with blood.”
“I take it this is not a recipe for cake.”
“No, Mr. Sinews,” said Clotho, giggling furiously. “No, it’s not cake.”
Alice and Dorothy hissed their agreement. So the absinthe must have been doing its work. A spider danced under the fabric of Clotho’s robe.
“Alright,” said Mr. Sinews, “So, the first ingredient is blood-filled leeches. What’s the second?”
“Well,” she said, grinning happily. “The next ingredient is absinthe.”
“Here,” said Lachesis, handing him a fresh bottle.
“Yes,” said Clotho with an overzealous laugh. “It’s got to be the good stuff,” she said.
“Right,” he said, “Leeches. Absinthe.”
“And pumpkins,” said Clotho.
“Pumpkins?” he repeated.
“Yes,” said Clotho, “It’s strange, I know. But the pumpkins are key.”
“Yes,” said Lachesis, getting up and fetching something from within the shadows of the darkly lit tea house. “You hollow it out, like this.”
“Yes, and you pour the absinthe into it.”
Lachesis handed him the hollowed pumpkin. It was strangely pale and white as snow. When he held it close to the light, it was oddly translucent.
“And then you add the leeches,” Clotho added.
“And then I drink it?” Mr. Sinews asked.
Atropos nodded without sharing in her sister’s unbridled enthusiasm.
“What does it do?”
“You’ll see,” said Clotho.
“Whose blood do I use?”
“That’s up to you,” said Atropos. “You’ve had a lot of time to contemplate, haven’t you? If you’re still looking for Dr. Allen, you’ll have to ask his accomplices where to find him, won’t you?”
“Yes,” said Mr. Sinews.
“And have you figured out who they are?”
“As you said, I’ve had a lot of time to sit and think,” he told her.
She smiled. “Well then,” she said, “Is there anything else we can do for you?”
“You can tell me where I can find leeches,” he said.
“Why don’t you ask your friend,” said Clotho. “The apothecary.”
“Ocelot,” he said in surprise.
“Yes,” she said, a large spider crawling upon her cheek.
“He’s not that kind of apothecary,” he said.
“You’ve been away for a few years,” she told him, “His wares have changed somewhat. He’s a procurer of specialty items. Not just opium and cocaine and women, but other things now, too. He’ll have what you need.”
“Alright,” he said.
“Oh,” she said, when he got up to leave. “Ask him about the scars.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene</Title>
            <Text>Avery Vane awoke with a sudden fluttering of his eyelids. The harsh light made him squint in pain. As his eyes began to adjust, he discovered that the room was actually dimly lit by a single oil lamp, which had been thrust into his face. He turned away from the harshness of the light, and took a look around the room.
He was in a laboratory. This, he could surmise from the test tubes, beakers, and other scientific equipment that lined the shelves, and from the preparations on the tables. Dissections of animals, as well as human organs, were preserved in jars of formaldehyde.
“So glad you’re awake,” said the doctor, still with his mask on. “My apologies. Mr. Hyde often forgets his own strength.”
The giant grunted. It might actually have been a genuine apology. Not that Avery could say the same for the doctor’s feigned civility.
The doctor set the oil lamp on the table, giving Avery the chance to look at him without staring directly into the harsh light. He noticed that the albino was no longer with them.
“So,” the doctor continued. “I regret any unnecessary roughness, Mr. Vane, but I do hope that it has given you an appreciation for how serious I am about the boy’s welfare.”
“The boy?” Avery repeated. “What does this have to do with him?”
“Mr. Vane, I need not remind you—and don’t believe for a moment that I’m merely pandering to your ego—that you are by far the best clockmaker in the country. I might even go so far as to say you are the best in the world.”
“Your point, Dr. Jekyll?” Avery asked, impatiently.
Pandering to his ego, indeed! Avery snorted with distaste. He looked straight into the doctor’s face. It was unnerving that he couldn’t see the man’s eyes, as they were hidden behind the mask’s tinted lenses. Nor could he recognize his voice, as it was distorted by the mask, which meant that there was no way of determining who the doctor really was. Jekyll was almost certainly an alias, borrowed from Robert Louis Stevenson’s story. Avery read the penny dreadfuls.
“My point, Mr. Vane, is that I’ve been taking on the responsibility of educating the boy. He’s very bright, you see, and very keen, and his father wants to provide him with the very best opportunities. I have an obligation which requires me to be away for a couple of months—”
“No,” Avery said. He could see perfectly well where this was going.
“He’ll be an excellent student,” the doctor continued, heedless of the interruption, “Although he bores easily. Did you know, I left for several months not too long ago; I arranged for young Jack to sit in at the university. He grew so bored he decided to open his own surgical practice, and when I returned from my business, I learned that Jack had been cutting classes every day and operating a rather successful business as a surgeon. He wore a mask, like mine, so that no one would realize he was only a thirteen, but his expertise as a surgeon is quite remarkable. Not just for a boy his age, but for any surgeon. I’m sure he’ll be quick to pick up the fine art of clockmaking, especially with you to—”
“No,” Avery said again.
“No?” the doctor repeated. He stood over Avery, who was seated on the floor, with his back against the wall. The effect was that the doctor seemed to tower over him. “Do you not see the position you’re in, Mr. Vane? Did you not see how easy it was for my associate and I to invite ourselves into your home?”
Avery refused to be intimidated. He spat. A great gob of spit landed square on the doctor’s right lens. Calmly, almost as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened, the doctor withdrew a handkerchief. He wiped the spit from his lens.
“Need I remind you about that unfortunate bit of bad business I helped you with a year ago? A little thing like that can come back to bite you. It was only lucky that you had such a dear friend as me to help you out. You might want to consider how you treat such friends.”
“Friends? You’re a tyrant. A bully. We’re not friends, Doctor. Do what you must. Tell the police if you have to, but I won’t work for you.”
“Come now, be reasonable. You killed your entire family. Mr. Vane, you killed your wife and daughters. You picked the meat off their bones, and you ate it.”
Avery whimpered. He didn’t like to think about that. Not that he ever forgot it, but he didn’t need the doctor to remind him.
“You’ll really let me tell the police?” asked Dr. Jekyll.
“I won’t let you intimidate me.”
“There is one other thing,” said the doctor. “If blackmail doesn’t frighten you, if the threat of violence doesn’t intimidate you, there is still one more thing.”
“What?”
“Your disease,” Jekyll said. His words oozed out of his mouth, slimy and foul.
Avery felt his heart stop, like a train that had run out of coal. Dead on its tracks. “What about it?”
“What would happen to you if your access to your medicine was suddenly cut off?” asked the doctor.
A lump formed in Avery’s throat. He tried to swallow, but his mouth was dry as ash.
“I keep a personal supply in a number of locations, known only to me,” Avery said. “Just in case.”
The doctor barked out a single, cold laugh, a harsh and metallic sound as it was filtered through the mask’s tubes and vents.
“Very enterprising of you, Mr. Vane. But let’s suppose that somebody discovered the locations of your secret supplies. What would become of you then?”
Avery swallowed. “First, my skin would begin to die. It would peal off in strips and flake away like skin does after a sunburn. Then my flesh would start to rot. Then, finally, when my body has all but died, my mind would be surrendered to the disease. An insatiable hunger would come over me. The urge to hunt for prey, to kill, and to eat.”
“And still you refuse to help me?” asked the doctor. “After all I’ve done to help you with this dreadful malady?”
At last, Avery let out a breath of air through his nostrils, a sigh of distress. He could see no way out of this.
“What, specifically, do you want me to teach this boy of yours?”
The doctor didn’t relish in his victory. He answered calmly as ever, as if he’d been entirely confident of the outcome of the conversation. “I’ve prepared an itinerary. So long as you follow it, and the boy comes to no harm while I’m away, I will ensure that your medicine continues to arrive on schedule,” he said. “Oh, and there’s one more thing.”
“Which is?”
“Should his father come to inquire after his wellbeing, you are to telegraph me straight-away. Tell the father that I’ve gone away on urgent business, and that I’ll be back shortly. Do not, under any circumstances, allow the father to learn that I am away long-term, or that you’ve been instructing the boy.”
It was strange. For all the doctor’s bravado, his intimidation, his posturing, his threats—if Avery didn’t know better, he would have guessed that Dr. Jekyll was afraid. It was impossible to say for certain. He could hardly judge by the man’s face, nor even by the cadence of his voice. But there was a tightness in the way he held his posture, when he spoke of the boy’s father.
Avery nodded, and the tension seemed to melt away.
“Good,” said the doctor. “Very good. I’ll have Mr. Hyde return you to your home. I hope you don’t mind wearing a blindfold. I’d prefer to keep my whereabouts a private matter, for now. You understand, don’t you?”
Again, Avery nodded.
“Good,” said the doctor.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Roderick converses with the Fates.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The black-robed sister moved slowly toward Roderick’s table, bearing his cup of tea, like she still expected him to drink anything that she had to offer. He had the feeling that he’d jumped out of the frying pan and into the fire. What’s more, he was certain it was not by coincidence that he’d ended up here.
As she drew near, he caught a glimpse of her face. Like Clotho’s, it was ancient, weathered, her skin paper-thin. She passed beneath the light of a lantern, and for a moment, he could see moths flitting about. They seemed to emanate from her. They bore the distinctive black and yellow wings of the death’s head hawkmoth.
“Acherontia Atropos,” he said.
She paused in her tracks, looking at him in surprise. “That’s right,” she said. Then she placed his teacup on the table. She nudged her sister’s shoulder. “We’ve got ourselves an entomologist here.”
“I’m more a jack of all trades. Lepidopterology. Mythology,” said Roderick, gesturing at the little wooden sign by the door. The Moirae Tea House. “Clotho,” he said, inclining his head at the white-robed sister who sat at his table. “Atropos, I presume,” he said, looking at the sister in the black robes. “And by process of elimination, you must be Lachesis.”
He was looking at the third sister now, the one who remained at the back of the tea house. Like Clotho, her robes were white. Her face was covered by a hood, her hands hidden in her loosely hanging sleeves.
“Fortune tellers posing as the goddesses of Fate. I suppose the added element of mystique must attract customers. A bit gimmicky for my tastes, of course, but I’m not exactly your demographic anyway, am I?” he said.
“Who’s posing?” said Clotho.
Roderick raised an eyebrow. “You don’t honestly expect me to believe you’re truly the Greek goddesses of Fate?”
Looking from one woman to another, Roderick wasn’t sure which one to fear most, the grinning one with spiders crawling across her hands, the scowling black-clad one with moths escaping her tattered robes, or the mysterious quiet one at the back of the Tea House, with who knew what beneath her robes. Was she covered in spiders like Clotho, or in moths like Atropos? Or was there something else entirely lurking beneath her sleeves?
A scratching sound from the windows suddenly reminded him that the threat inside was not the only one.
“Your doing?” he said, indicating that he meant the vampires outside. Of course, Clotho had already explained or at least implied that these vampires were made by the Resurrectionists, but how could he think logically about things like vampires and goddesses? And when logic failed, Roderick was not himself. So he left the accusation hanging in the air.
“Everything is our doing,” said Clotho.
“Oh right,” he said bitterly, “How could I forget?”
There was a chorus of laughter from the Moirae. Their voices were echoed by the moans of the dead men outside. To Roderick’s alarm, new voices had been added to that chorus. New dead men had joined the two he’d already encountered. Bailey took to barking again, yipping frantically as Clotho grinned and leaned forward.
“You still haven’t tried the tea,” she urged.
“I’ll pass,” Roderick said, testily. He wasn’t ignorant of the danger, but his mind was too busy trying to sort its way through the puzzles to pay it any heed. “It wasn’t coincidence that brought me here. The ghouls in the alley, or whatever they are. Vampires, what-have-you. You used them to lure me here, didn’t you?”
“No, it was fate,” said Clotho, her mouth still stretched into a hideous smile. He might have been imagining things, but it looked as though there were spiders wriggling inside her mouth when she smiled, spinning webs on her teeth.
“I doubt that very much. I imagine you somehow planted the ghouls in the alley, knowing Bailey would be drawn to their rather potent stench.”
“Perhaps you think too much,” said Atropos. “What makes you think we even wanted you here?”
“Well, I happen to think you’re collaborating with Lord Connor’s murderer,” he said. Roderick indicated Clotho. “This one says his killer was here earlier. Anthony Tidkins,” he added.
Atropos glared at her sister. She settled into the chair directly beside her, as Clotho retreated to the back of the room, beside Lachesis.
“You’re wrong, Mr. Steen,” said Atropos, once she’d settled into the chair. “It’s true that he came here; he wanted his palms read. But we are not collaborating with the Resurrectionists, nor did we lure you here. Your presence here is purely coincidental, I can assure you.”
“Oh, yes, of course. Fate,” he said sarcastically. “I’m a man of logic. Not superstition and old wives’ tales.”
Clotho laughed scornfully. “Where do you think the old wives get their tales, Mr. Steen?”
“So, you don’t believe in fate?” asked Atropos.
Roderick shook his head.
“You ought to,” said Atropos. “We believe in you.”</Text>

            <Text>As they rushed to the railings and peered over, they heard it, an unmistakable sound from beneath them: the sound of a harpoon gun being fired. Mr. Palmer was the first to react. With impossibly quick reflexes, his hand shot out and grasped the harpoon by the shaft as it shot up from below, at which Lockwood exclaimed yet again.
“By God!” he cried, having joined them out on the deck.
Miss Monday grabbed ahold of Mr. Palmer in what was likely a serious breach of etiquette, but she feared he might have otherwise been launched from the dirigible by Mr. O’s weight and momentum. Even with her assistance, the pair slammed into the railing, which creaked in protest.
She held tight to his waist, but when she heard the sound of wood splintering, she knew that it would not be enough.
“I don’t suppose you’d care to lend us a hand, Mr. Lockwood,” said Miss Monday, “If it’s not too much trouble.”
Thusly admonished, Lockwood hurried to lend a hand, and with his and the captain’s assistance, Mr. Steen was able to secure the harpoon’s line to the rapidly plummeting Dreadful.
Below, Miss Monday could see him, dangling from the line like a fish on a hook.
“Are you alright?” she cried.
“I’ll be much better with my feet on solid ground, I should think,” he shouted back.
“Serves you right,” she grumbled.
Meanwhile the Captain returned his attention to the ship, which was still losing altitude. He directed Ashcroft to check the Engineering Cabin for a replacement ballonet.
“Better haul him up quickly,” said Captain Merrick. “Then we’ll have to hoist the sails.”
Mr. Palmer and Mr. Lockwood set about the task, while Miss Monday busied herself with wiping the pieces of rotten carapace from her hair and clothes, and trying to appear unconcerned about Mr. O.
Finally, they managed to haul him over the side of the ship. Covered in blood, his clothing in tatters, Miss Monday still wasn’t sure whether to slap him or kiss him.
She ran over to him. She couldn’t help herself. She put her arms around him, bloody and bruised though he was. She didn’t care if it hurt him. She held him close, and he returned the embrace. She lowered her head, even when he placed a hand, gently, upon her chin, and tried to make her look at him. She didn’t want him to see that there were tears on her cheek.
“I’m alright,” he said.
“You idiot,” she said, pounding her fists against his chest, not with any real force, but still enough to make him wince in pain. “You unbelievable idiot.”
She glared. “Don’t ever try that again.”
“I don’t think I shall,” he said, and he laughed until it turned into a cough. He winced.
“Better get inside,” she said, suddenly concerned. “I think there may be a medical kit inside.”
“There is,” he said. “It’s called liquor.”
She shook her head. “No, Mr. O,” she said. “You’ve had quite enough of that this evening. How about a cup of tea?”
He limped as he walked, and she had to wonder if he’d broken anything. It would be a miracle if he hadn’t. Probably dislocated a shoulder, at the very least. Bloody idiot. She gave him another once over.
His skin was scorched, blistered, bloody, and raw. Discoloured by bruises and burns.
“No lemon,” he muttered.</Text>

            <Text>Now

As instructed, he’d spoken with H.C. Ocelot, who’d given him a jar of leeches and told him about the scars.
It was the scars told him where to go.
They told him to go to Bernhardt’s. And that is where he went.
“Hello, Parson,” Bernhardt sneered.
“Dr. Bernhardt,” said Mr. Sinews.
Taking his cane casually in one hand, he struck Bernhardt repeatedly. The man cried out in protest, but Mr. Sinews was relentless. He stepped inside Mr. Bernhardt’s residence and closed the door.
He slashed Bernhardt’s face with his knife.
He then extracted his jar of leeches, placed the largest of the leeches on Bernhardt’s face and waited patiently as the leech sucked the blood from his adversary’s face.
Bernhardt screamed.
“How did you find me?” he demanded. “How did you know who I was?”
“Well,” said Mr. Sinews, “I had a lot of time to sit and contemplate. I started thinking about Dr. Allen’s pseudonym. George Allen. There was something so simple about the name, so common, the familiarity of it was maddening. Then it dawned on me where he’d gotten the name. George Chapman was a notorious serial killer, a poisoner apparently suspected in the Jack Ripper Case. Viola Allen, the American actress.”
Bernhardt spat and kicked at his captor as the leeches sucked on his blood, but Mr. Sinews held tight.
“Then I started thinking about who Dr. Allen’s accomplices might have been, I must have gone over every single name of every man and woman I’ve ever known. You see, I had all the time in the world. Jack the Ripper. Sara Bernhardt. Your name was even more obvious than Dr. Allen’s.”
When the leeches were finished, he plucked them from Bernhardt’s face and placed them into the hollow gourd.
“Of course, it was Mr. Ocelot that confirmed my theory,” said Mr. Sinews. “He told me about the scars that you gave him. Of course, he didn’t recognize your face when he met you all those years ago in the tea shop. But he did tell me what you said to him, about the mask.”
“What?” he said.
“You told him, apparently, why you wore the mask. He’d thought it was simply to terrify your victims. But it wasn’t. You wore the mask because you were afraid your patients wouldn’t respect you, given your age. You said that your patients would be more comfortable with a man in a mask than a doctor as young as seventeen. That’s how I knew that it was not Doctor Allen that had given Ocelot the scars. It had to be someone else, someone much younger. There had to be a second man in the crow’s mask. An impostor.”
“You’re wrong,” Bernhardt protested, “You’re wrong!”
“Oh?” said Mr. Sinews.
“Dr. Allen copied me,” he sneered bitterly. “I was the first to wear the crow’s mask. Everything about that man, every aspect of his fame, it was all my doing. In fact,” Bernhardt added, “He didn’t even want to do those acts that made him famous. Those works of genius for which he was so lauded, the credit should go to me. I was the one who gave him the power.”
“What do you mean?” asked Mr. Sinews.
“Man is weak,” said Bernhardt, “Limited not by the power of his imagination, but by his capacity for evil. Take away his inhibitions and he will be truly powerful. I gave him that power.”
“So it’s true,” said Mr. Sinews, “The behaviour-altering concoction I spoke of. You gave it to Dr. Allen, after all?”
But Dr. Allen simply laughed. He’d gone insane with the frustration of being discovered by Mr. Sinews and with the anger that he still felt toward Dr. Allen who’d stolen his genius and claimed it as his own.
“There are other ways to find out,” said Mr. Sinews. He poured the absinthe into the pumpkin, and he watched it turn black as the red and green of blood and absinthe blended in a hiss of steam.
He grimaced at the horrid smell that emanated from the glass, and drank as the white pumpkin turned red with blood. It tasted like liquorice and nickel, and it was warm and thick in his mouth, but he drank it down, fighting off the instinct to gag on the foul substance.</Text>

            <Title>Scene 12</Title>
            <Text>Annabel stumbled onto the street, gasping for air. She didn’t know if she’d inhaled whatever vapours had been released into the air, but she might have. She had a strange taste in her mouth and the smell of death still lingered. She felt disoriented. She heard a rumbling sound from above and looked up to see Mr. O’s airship pulling away from the window. She felt a breath of relief to know that he’d made it out.
She took a moment to catch her breath while she gazed up at the airship. If she’d been anyone else, she would not have been able to make out the details from here. The name printed on the airship’s blimp, for instance. Most people couldn’t have read it from this distance. But Annabel wasn’t just anyone; the concealed poison dart was not the only advantage of her mechanical eye. From the angle she’d seen the airship at from inside the house, she hadn’t been able to see it, but from here, she could just make out Grimmer and Sons Publishing Inc. She wondered what Mr. O’s connection to the Grimmers might be. He might be an employee, a journalist, or perhaps an editor. It was even possible that he was Jonathan Grimmer. Was he the same man whose invitation she’d swiped on the way in to the masquerade? She couldn’t be certain. Either way, she now had a trail leading back to him.
She glanced back at the house. Through the open front door, she could see men and women writhing on the floor, succumbing to fits, drool escaping their lips. Amid the chaos, the crow-faced men wandered the crowd, unaffected by the deadly gas.
She swore. She’d been in dangerous spots before, but very few like this. She’d barely gotten out of there alive. Annabel knew her work was dangerous. Her associates were criminals, and if she was being honest, she was one herself. She knew the dangers. She knew the risks. The truth was, it was danger she enjoyed most about her work. But suddenly it had ceased being fun. Suddenly it was real, it was visceral. The most frustrating thing was how helpless she felt just now. She hadn’t felt that in a long time. Not since the day her eye was plucked out.
She wanted to go back in there, stab each and every one of those bastards in the guts for for this. But she couldn’t even breathe the air inside the mansion. And she was outnumbered, and they were better armed. All she could do was watch in horror as wealthy gentlemen and high society ladies collapsed, coughing and hacking until their lungs gave in and their faces turned purple. Really, she ought to do as they said and just walk away, leave this place. Well, she ought to summon a policeman, really, but what good could the police do now? The poison was spreading throughout the house, and the police would be ill equipped to deal with it. Besides, Annabel couldn’t recall a time when she’d ever done what she ought to do.
She distanced herself from the entrance of the house, circling around to the west wing, where she could see inside through one of the house’s grand windows. She could still hear screaming from inside the mansion, as the Resurrectionists paced around the halls, spreading fumes. She could see a drifting haze through the curtains, the fog was so thick.
She wondered if anyone else had escaped. She couldn’t imagine why they were doing this. Why had they felt it necessary to rob her, when they could have just bought the stolen goods from her once she’d safely infiltrated Connor’s safe and gotten away? The first crow-masked man she’d encountered had even said he would still pay her! And why the toxic gas? Were they merely covering their tracks, eliminating witnesses? She wondered if it even had anything to do with the package she’d taken from Connor. As for that, the package was still safely stashed away in her hidden pocket, but this was only a small comfort. She felt sick, for whatever part she’d played in this. If she’d known, if she’d only known who her buyers were, and what lengths they would go to to get their merchandise…
She never would have agreed to sell to them.
The question still remained, what now? Her lungs burned, and she strained just to breathe, even now with fresh air all around her. Had she breathed in those toxic fumes? She couldn’t be certain. But her head ached. It was hard to think. To go to the police and summon help, or to linger here, watching through the windows in the hopes that she might get some chance to sate her thirst for bloody vengeance. The longer she waited, the more evident it became that she’d already made up her mind.
She continued to circle around the mansion, until she found herself amongst tall rhododendrons, lilies and hibiscus. Rose bushes and ferns. A tall statue, a fountain. It was too dark to make out the details, but the flickering lights from nearby windows cast shadows across a stone walkway that led through the lush rear garden behind Connor’s enormous house.
The screams from within the house began to subside, and the night grew disturbingly quiet. Those who might have escaped had already done so, or failed to do so. The rest had already succumbed to the poisoned air and either lost consciousness or died. Annabel was not sure of its effects, but the only comfort she had was that she had not inhaled enough to be so afflicted as those inside.
She wondered how many had gotten out, and was surprised to realize that she was grateful that Mr. O was among their numbers. Well, he was handsome, after all, and he’d proven useful, so that might have accounted for the sentiment. He was a witness, though; it would have been more prudent to wish him dead, but she just couldn’t bring herself to wish for that. For the second time that night, she wished she could be just a bit more ruthless.
As she continued creeping forward, keeping close to the walls of the house, she wondered if anyone had gone to the police, if not a survivor of the poison gas then perhaps a neighbour, having heard the screams. She didn’t want to be here when the police arrived. But she did want to see what was going on inside, and she couldn’t see the ballroom from the windows on this side of the house. There was the balcony nearby. She would get a clear view inside if she could climb up there somehow, if she could find a ladder or just a foothold in the brickwork of the house.
Before she had a chance to search for one, a loud crash came from nearby. Glass shattered, and with an inhuman roar, something tumbled out of the house. A blur of shadow, it landed hard, on the ground below. It stopped moving. Heart pounding, she knew she ought to run now. Every instinct, every nerve in her body was telling her to run, just run! Instead, ignoring her racing heartbeat, Annabel crept through the garden towards it, looking intermittently between the dark shape on the ground and the shattered glass of the window above.
“That was quick,” said a muffled voice. The sound originated from the broken window.
“Incubation period varies,” said another voice from above. She spotted the first now, sticking his head between the broken glass and looking down. She kept low to the ground, out of sight in the thick shadows of the garden. “Some turn almost instantly. Others take minutes, hours even. Nobody’s really sure why.”
Annabel looked back at the shape on the ground. It was moving again, getting up. She could see broken limbs now that she was closer. It was a man. A gentleman, perhaps, but there was nothing gentle about him now. His clothes were in tatters, his hat missing from his head. And though his bones were broken, his form twisted so unnaturally he hardly looked human, he hardly seemed to have noticed the state he was in. He was looking at Annabel, sniffing at the air, and staring at her with hunger in his eyes. The same way Lord Connor had looked at her. She reached for her gun, ready to shoot if he came at her. But she kept still and watched, knowing she would give away her position if she fired. She tried to quiet her breathing, and kept statue-still.
Suddenly, the man started charging. She whipped out her revolver, but before she could even get her hand on the trigger, a gunshot rang out. The man fell to the ground, a hole punched straight through his head.
“Nice shot,” said a muffled voice from the window.
Annabel whipped around. She looked up at the window. The men in the plague doctor masks seemed not to have seen her yet. They were looking out the window, but their focus was on the man they’d just shot. They were probably making sure he wasn’t going to get up again. So Annabel took her time, aimed, and pulled the trigger. She hit the first of them. He dropped, right through the window he was leaning out of, and landed in the rose bushes below.
The second man yelped in surprise and drew his own weapon. Annabel didn’t hesitate to put a bullet in his neck. She holstered her revolver and crossed the walkway to the rose bushes where the first of them had fallen. He was groaning, so that was good. She wanted him alive. But he was reaching for something, a gun maybe.
She stepped closer, seized his hand before he reached it, and looked into his eyes.
“Who do you work for?” she asked. Her tone was calm, and her face was impassive. Even if inside she was shaking, she gave no outward signs that she was frightened. It was time to be ruthless.
He shook his head and coughed. Annabel frowned at him. Well, there were ways of making people talk, weren’t there? His vest was wet with blood, a hole ripped through it where she’d hit him. She reached out and with a gloved hand, thrust her fingers into his wound. He screamed, but she didn’t let up. Just kept her fingers digging into his chest until sweat dripped down his brow. It was a bit disturbing, feeling her fingers inside his wound, but what disturbed her most was that on some level, she felt deep satisfaction. How’s this for ruthless, she thought.
He muttered something.
She withdrew her hand, peeled the straps off his mask, and revealed his face. She was surprised to see how young he was. And how handsome. For a moment, she felt a horrible sense of guilt. He was about to die, and she was literally torturing him. Then she thought of the piles of corpses that even now lined the halls. She remembered who he was. She leaned in close to his face so she could hear what he had to say.
“Resurrectionists,” he coughed.
She narrowed her eyes. She knew a thing or two about the Resurrectionists. She knew he wasn’t just talking about body snatchers, either.
“What was in the vial?” she demanded. “Some sort of poison?”
For a moment, it looked like he might not answer. Stubborn, even now, as he lay dying on the rose bush. But then, he coughed up a bit of blood, and looked up into Annabel’s eyes. He was almost smiling when he answered. “Lazarus,” he said, coughing.
“What is Lazarus?”
“Virus,” he said.
Annabel nodded. This filled in one piece of the puzzle. The man who’d tumbled out of the window after inhaling this Lazarus Virus, had been afflicted with the same thing as Connor. And if the virus could be spread by poison gas, it was possible Connor had been infected deliberately. She thought of what Mr. O had said about Lord Connor; he had dangerous friends. Was it possible that Connor’s friends were the ones who infected him?
She stood up, fished around in her pockets for another bullet. Finding one, she reloaded her revolver, fired it, and walked away. She would have loved to linger, to shoot every last one of these damned Resurrectionists one by one. But the police would be coming soon, and she had only so many bullets.</Text>
            <Comments>You have moved so far into the story that jumping back here seems a bit jarring.  Suggestion, move this bit of Annabel’s story before introducing Roderick.
Edit: Moved earlier than before.
Include if she deduces that Mr. O is really Jonathan Grimmer or simply works for the company?  Either way, she has a way of finding him if needed.
When she stole the invitation to the gala, she had read the name 
"Grimmer" on it.  Thus, she should have known who Mr. O. was.  Maybe…
Is this because of the possible vapors she breathed in, the binding, or psychological maybe?
Could this be due to a subconscious attraction?
Was she calm and collected or was her heart pounding?  Any sign of being scared?
Did she keep still and watch or is she ready to pull out her gun and shoot the man with the broken limbs before the man at the window shoots him?
Describe her facial expression or tone of voice.  I think this can add a layer of detail for the reader.
Did this bother her to some level?  Feeling her fingers push into his wound?  Had she done this before?
I like that you ended her perspective with this line!</Comments>

Annabel flopped back into her chair. Her ecru dress was now a red dress, though she hadn’t taken the time to change. Jonathan and Lockwood were staring at her. She took a sip of tea, ignoring both of them.
She frowned.

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>Having swallowed enough of the Moirae’s concoction to begin feeling its effects, Mr. Sinews picked up his cane and bludgeoned Dr. Bernhardt to death with it.
“Well,” he said, “Glad that’s over.”
Then he keeled over in pain as his stomach protested against the foul substance he’d just drunk. His head swum. He felt as if he were about to black out.
And then he did.
When his head hit the floor, he was filled with Dr. Bernhardt’s memories. All of them, rushing in at once.
Suddenly he knew the identity of Dr. Allen, he knew what Dr. Bernhardt had had for dinner that evening, he knew that Bernhardt had worked for The Agency, he knew exactly where to find Dr. Allen.
And he knew that Rachelle Singe had been Dr. Bernhardt’s accomplice, that she’d been a scientist, that she’d lied to him throughout their entire relationship. The pain of it stabbed through him like a knife, even as Dr. Bernhardt’s memories continued to rush through his mind all at once.
“That bitch,” he said angrily, as he saw, in Dr. Bernhardt’s memories, her familiar face, conspiring with Dr. Bernhardt and Dr. Allen to frame him in order to get him to stop pursuing the Dr. Allen case.
“He’s too persistent,” said Rachelle, “He’ll never give it up. Not even for me.”
“You’ve got to make him,” said Dr. Allen.
“I’ve tried,” she said.
“He knows too much already,” said Dr. Bernhardt, “We’ve got to do something about him.”
“Right,” said Rachelle, “We’ll frame him for my murder.”
“What? Are you insane?” said Dr. Allen.
Bernhardt just laughed. “No, she’s brilliant,” he said, “We’ll just bring her back after he’s in prison. That’s what the antidote is for.”
“And what if it doesn’t work?” said Dr. Allen.
Bernhardt sneered. “You’re too soft,” he said, “Even after we took my concoction. You were always still squeamish about your work.”
“I’ve done horrid things,” he said, “Things I wish could be undone. All because of that infernal concoction of yours. The only thing that keeps me going is that this is for the greater good.”
“Yes,” said Rachelle, smiling in a way that was terrifying to Mr. Sinews in that it was so familiar, yet this was not her usual smile. He had never seen her like this before. “It is progress. Science. The rest of the world would not understand it. Those who object to the progress of science must be destroyed by it.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene</Title>
            <Text>Joe and Filch arrived at the door a little past midnight, with Miss Belmont with them.  It was darker than death.  The single lamp a block away barely penetrated the thick fog that permeated the dismal streets of Chicago, and Joe could hardly see his own hand when he outstretched his arm to rap on the door.
The darkness was oppressive.  The silence was worse.
"Break it down," he said.  "Break down this bloody door."
Despite the fervor in his voice, Filch hesitated.  "Sir, you've been after this bastard a long time.  We've finally caught up to him.  You sure you don't want to do the honors?"
Joe grunted his reply.  He sized up the door.  He was getting too old for this kind of thing, and he was hardly dressed for kicking down doors, what with his trenchcoat, fedora, and dress shoes.  Still, this would be worth doing.  He thrust a cigarette in his mouth and looked to Miss Belmont to light it.
She was happy to oblige, somehow managing to make the gesture a flirtatious one.  She held Joe's eyes while she leaned in and struck the match.  Like Joe, she was overdressed for the occasion, in a leggy black dress and a wide-brimmed hat, long silk gloves on her hands.  Like Joe, she was smoking a cigarette, but unlike him, she did it with style, with grace.  With a long cigarette holder.  She was supposed to be in mourning, but Joe had the sense that she was enjoying this.
"Let's get this rat," she said.
"This is Joe Frost," he announced, giving his hat to Filch to hold on to.  "Open up."
There was no answer.  He waited, but he wasn't a patient man.  He looked to Miss Belmont, who nodded enthusiastically.
Joe turned back to the door and aimed a kick at it, putting his whole body into the motion.  The wood splintered loudly, the sound echoing through the fog.  The latch broke and clicked open.  Sweating already from the effort, Joe turned to Filch, retrieved his hat, and gestured to the door.  He replaced the hat upon his head as they opened the door.
The stench, when they crossed the threshold, was overwhelming.  There was the sound of flies buzzing, but otherwise they were navigating blindly.  "Let's get some light in here," Joe growled.  He aimed his pistol at the shadows as his eyes adjusted to the light.  It had been dark enough outside.  In here, it was darker still.  The slightest hint of light was filtered through fog and glass and the white curtains that covered the windows.  But then, as he rounded the corner, brandishing his revolver, there was something else.  Something besides Filch flicking on the flashlight.
"Stay with her," he told Filch, while he made his way into the hallway.
It was long, and at its was a bookcase, filled not with books but with mason jars.  In each jar, a firefly.  His mouth opened so wide his cigarette fell right out.  He closed it, set his jaw in a firm line, and stomped out the cigarette right there on the carpet.
He headed down the hallway, following the light of the fireflies.  This was definitely the place.  The house of the Mason Jar Man.  "This is it," he called to Filch.

Six years ago, the murders had begun.  Each one, increasingly more gruesome.  The common thread that linked the killings; in each case, the victims' families noted one single item missing from their home.  A mason jar.  It was hard to imagine that anyone would commit murder for something so simple, so unimportant as a mason jar, and the murders had gathered public interest and attention.  The newspapers had followed the story for a while, but they began to lose interest the longer the case went unsolved.
But not Joe...
He never faltered, never lost interest.  He had followed the Mason Jar Man with single-minded determination.  And it had paid off.  The biggest lead in six years, was Miss Belmont herself.
It was Miss Belmont who'd first caught sight of the monster they called the Mason Jar Man.</Text>

            <Title>Scene 23</Title>
            <Text>Jonathan aimed at the sky and fired the flare. An arc of green light illuminated the clouds, trailing smoke. The sudden burst of bright light was brilliant, like a flash of lightning, but it quickly dissipated.
The police carriages had all gone, and he and Henry Charles Ocelot left the darkness of the alley for the darkness of the street where the flare had landed. The faint glow of Jonathan’s flare still lingered, subtly illuminating the sky.
“My offer still stands, Mr. Grimmer. I may not have quite the expertise of Mr. Sinews, but I have picked up a few things regarding the Resurrectionists. Should you ever need anything…”
“Thank you,” said Jonathan.
He thought of what Parson Sinews had told him, and felt sick. He thought of his father’s death. Jonathan had been told it was an accident, but in light of what he’d just learned, he thought of his father’s death with a new outlook.
“Why do you suppose the police believe Mr. Sinews is the Resurrection Man?” Jonathan asked.
Jonathan had narrowed it down to two possibilities. One, that Mr. Sinews really was Anthony Tidkins. The other…
“He was set up,” Mr. Ocelot said.
It was true that Sinews hadn’t been the one to put a bullet through Connor’s skull. That dubious honor went to Mr. Monday. That didn’t prove Sinews wasn’t Anthony Tidkins, but it did prove that the police couldn’t have evidence to support their accusation.
“Given Mr. Sinews’ eccentricities and his reputation, it would not have been difficult for the Resurrectionists to blame him for Connor’s death,” Mr. Ocelot continued. “All it would take was for one of the Resurrectionists to claim they’d seen Sinews at the site of Connor’s death.”
At last, Jonathan spotted his ship, its hanging lanterns cutting through the heavy rain. Shivering, he waved at the ship with his umbrella, not certain the captain could see him any better than he could see the ship.  He kept his eye on it, until it began to descend.
He returned his attention to Mr. Ocelot, and nodded thoughtfully. If he could learn the name of the witness who provided Sinews’ name to the police, he might have the name of one of the Resurrectionists.
“I hate to bring up your father’s untimely death, but there may have been some truth to Mr. Sinews’ suggestion that his death was not an accident. Your father was an expert on the Resurrectionists, and he met his untimely end. Mr. Sinews was an expert as well, and he was neatly disposed of,” said Mr. Ocelot.
The airship continued to descend, its propellers whirring noisily, until Captain Merrick’s face came into view. He saluted. Jonathan returned the salute, and the aeronaut lowered a rope ladder.
“Be careful, Mr. Grimmer. It seems that anyone who poses a threat to the Resurrectionists is being eliminated.”
Jonathan was forced to agree. Since escaping the Resurrectionists, Jonathan had been trying to convince himself that they were no longer after him, that they didn’t know who he was. For the first time, he realized that it didn’t matter whether or not they were coming after him. He was coming after them. They had killed his father. They were planning to spread a deadly virus throughout the city. There was too much at stake to let them get away with it.
It wasn’t just about writing an article for his newspaper any more, either. It was about saving his city. It was about catching his father’s killer.
Jonathan also had Roderick to consider. As far as Jonathan knew, Roderick was the leading authority on the Resurrectionists, especially now that Sinews had been arrested. If Ocelot was right and his employer really wasn’t Anthony Tidkins, then Roderick was in danger.</Text>

            <Text>She stepped into her walk-in closet, slipped out of her dress, and put on her nightgown.  That was when her husband began to scream.  When she came out of the closet, he was already dead, sprawled out on his bed, the sheets stained bright red.  His throat torn open.  His eyes, removed.
She didn't linger long at his side.  She heard the murderer's footsteps, thudding down the stairs.  Fetching a revolver from the nightstand, she hurried into the hallway.  Where had the bastard gone?  He'd vanished, like a puff of smoke, a shadow.
She heard the squeak of the door.  No, he was still there.  She aimed at the door, squeezed the trigger, and was answered with a satisfying spray of blood and the shattering of the door's glass frame as the bullet passed through her husband's murderer.
She heard him curse, and she watched, as she'd caught sight of him at last, him stumble through the door and make his way into the back yard, heading for the alley.
She followed him, daringly heading for the door, and stepped through it.  Seeing his shadowy figure still in the yard, she fired again, hitting him once more.  He dropped something, and it shattered.  A flickering, ebbing light drifted from whatever she'd dropped, and he roared in outrage.  He turned to face her, and she stepped back.  He truly was a monster.
His mouth revealed a set of jagged teeth, thin and sharp as needles.  His eyes were empty sockets, like the eyes of his victims, but his were covered with a cluster of flies.  And when they moved it was like he was blinking.
Stepping back, Miss Belmont retreated into the house, letting the man get away.  First thing in the morning, she'd gone to Joe Frost, the Private Investigator.  Joe had followed the trail of blood, and as for Miss Belmont, well, she had insisted on going with him.</Text>

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>Mr. O arrived at Dr. Bernhardt’s house, just as Mr. Sinews was leaving.
“Mr. Grimmer,” said Mr. Sinews.
“I don’t go by that name any more,” said Mr. O.
“Right,” said Mr. Sinews. “I knew that. I’ve just been given Dr. Bernhardt’s memories.”
“Uh…” said Mr. O.
“Long story,” said Mr. Sinews.
“I see,” said Mr. O. “Anyway, I’d hoped to find you here. We only just received word that you’d murdered him in his house weeks ago; I came on the off-chance that you hadn’t left yet.”
“He hasn’t been dead for weeks,” said Mr. Sinews, “Your source of information is flawed.”
“Anyway, I’m off to Dr. Allen’s house. I know where he lives now, because it was in Dr. Bernhardt’s memories.”
“Oh, that’s quite convenient,” said Mr. O, “Shall we work together?”
“Yes,” said Mr. Sinews, “Why not? Oh, by the way, you don’t happen to have a dirigible, do you?”
“Funny you should ask,” said Mr. O, who gestured to the Penny Dreadful, which was floating just out of Mr. Sinews’ view. “Mr. Steen, could you lower a ladder or something?” he shouted.
“That isn’t Edward Steen, is it?” asked Mr. Sinews as they climbed the ladder.
“No,” said Mr. O, “His son, Roderick Steen.”
When they had climbed the ladder and safely boarded the Penny Dreadful, Mr. O made the necessary introductions.
“Away we go,” said Captain Merrick, who sailed the ship over London, all the way to Dr. Allen’s house.
Quickly, they climbed down the ladder.
“44 Allen’s Street,” said Mr. O in disbelief, “So, he’s been here this whole time.”
“Yes,” said Mr. Sinews, “Hiding in plain sight.”
“Well,” said Ms. Monday. “Shall we?”
“You do the honours,” said Mr. O.
So Ms. Monday kicked open the door.
But when they stepped inside, they discovered that Dr. Allen was already dead.
And standing over his body was Dr. Singe.
She was just as she’d been in his nightmare. An eight-legged abomination. A mask sewn onto her face, made of bone and fur. But she was different now. Her voice was not a recording. It was really her, returned from the dead.
“Hello, Parson,” she said.
“You do the honours,” said Ms. Monday. She handed over her gun.
“I’ve been waiting a long time for this,” said Mr. Sinews, taking the pistol. He smiled sadly. “Goodbye, Rachelle,” he said.

            <Title>Scene 26</Title>
            <Synopsis>Annabel learns that last night’s events went unreported by the newspapers. She heads for Grimmer &amp; Sons.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Morning struck Annabel like a brick wall. She sat up in a violent jolt, gasping for air as if she’d been under water, holding her breath. She’d slept with the curtains open, and light hit her eyes so hard it was blinding, painful. She’d been so tired when she climbed into bed that she’d fallen asleep with her prosthesis still strapped in, which was like sleeping with one eye open. She had no way of blinking that eye, or closing it, except to remove the straps and unclasp it.
She did that now, not just to keep the light out, but also because it needed to be cleaned regularly, its clockwork needed to be wound, and its hidden compartment reloaded with a poisoned dart. There was a hiss of air and the clicking of metal clasps as she took it off. While the eye itself was clockwork, the clasps that held it in place relied on pneumatics. She set the device on her lap.
There were times when Annabel felt tempted to remove all the mirrors from her bedroom. She caught a glimpse of her reflection in the vanity, just now, and that temptation resurfaced. She hated seeing her own naked eye socket with its bits of gleaming surgical steel implanted in her flesh. She hated looking at the wicked scar that ran down her face. She could practically feel the fingernails gouging into her flesh all over again, and she felt sickened by it. But she didn’t turn away.
She took the key she wore around her neck, fit it into the mechanical eye, and used it to turn the device. She heard the sound of clockwork turning. It was comforting, somehow, like hearing the sound of her own heartbeat. She could see perfectly fine without the clockwork running, but she couldn’t control what she was looking at, just stare straight ahead. The clockwork allowed her to look from left and right. To focus. To do the sort of things she could do with her real eye, and more.
Once it was wound, she cleaned it, polished the brass until it shone, and fit another dart into the concealed compartment. She wound each of her clockwork parts. Finally, she strapped the eye back on her face and could look at her reflection a bit more easily. With that part of her morning ritual complete, she got dressed—in her own attire this time, rather than the disguise she’d worn last evening—and used a bit of powder to reduce the appearance of her scars. Then she set out for London’s streets.
She sensed immediately that something had changed while she’d slept. Normally bustling, her neighbourhood was now quiet, the windows of the houses shuttered or even boarded up. A number of houses had broken windows. She stared across the street at a house whose door swung on its hinges, the wood splintered as if it had been broken down. It looked like an earthquake had hit, or a storm had ravaged the city. Shattered glass and rubble littered the sidewalk. She saw smoke in the distance.
In the quiet, she heard the sweet young voices of a group of girls playing a game on the street corner, skipping and singing a nursery rhyme.
“Burke’s the butcher, Hare’s the thief, Knox the boy that buys the beef,” they sang.
“Cheerful tune,” Annabel muttered.
As she stared, a woman in tattered clothing came tearing down the street towards the children, tears streaking down her face, blood staining her dress. When she reached the girls, she scooped one of them up in her arms, hugging the girl so tightly it must have been painful.
“Thank god!” she kept saying. “I’m so sorry, loves. I got back ‘ere as soon as I could. Get back in the ‘ouse, loves. Quick now, grab what ye can, then we’re leavin’.”
Annabel blinked at them in confusion, trying to make sense of what was going on.
The woman noticed Annabel looking at her and staggered back in alarm.
“Get back in the ‘ouse, now, girls!” she said, more urgently now, putting herself between Annabel and the girls. Her eyes went wide as Annabel stepped closer to her, hands up defensively. Once the girls were inside, the woman turned and ran, not looking back once. She slammed the door shut as Annabel shook her head in wonder.
What had happened while Annabel slept?
She continued along the street, gaping at the changed landscape. Annabel’s neighbourhood was on the lower end of middle class. She could afford a nicer house in a nicer neighbourhood, but having grown up dirt poor, Annabel was honestly happier on her humble little street than she might have been in a wealthier part of town. Besides, she didn’t want anyone asking questions about where she got her money. Following whatever storm had struck last night, it felt more like a slum.
On a corner, a dirty young boy stood peddling papers. He looked ready to bolt at any moment. He eyed Annabel with suspicion as she approached.
“Attacks throughout London!” he cried. “Read all about it!”
Annabel stopped in front of him.
“What sort of attacks?”
 “You look like a lady wiv’ an appreciashun fer fine literature,” he said, giving her a wink. “Ye’ll ‘ave ter buy a paper if ye wanna know.”
She grinned.
“Cheeky lad,” she said, her own well-practiced accent slipping as she spoke to the youngster. She fished a few coins out of her pocket, and handed them over. He grinned and gave her the paper.
“Bit morbid, innit?” he said, while she flipped through it.
She scanned the headlines. Reading wasn’t one of the things she excelled at, but she could do it passably. She read the headline.
“Ordinary Citizens Rampage Throughout London. Something In The Water?” she read.
She scanned the article. It described a number of seemingly unrelated incidents, in which ordinary citizens seemed to lose their minds and brutally attack their loved ones. The writer guessed at the number of isolated incidents being close to one thousand, each of the attacks taking place all throughout the city. The article encouraged people to stay indoors and not to let anyone inside. It speculated as to the cause of the incidents. The headline’s suggestion of there being something in the water was just one possible explanation. The author also considered that the attackers might have been stricken with some sort of illness.
She continued reading. The article went on to state that in a number of cases, the attackers were described as cannibals. They were crazed and could not be reasoned with. Furthermore, the attackers could not easily be harmed; the article described the attackers being shot, stabbed, and even set on fire, without seeming to feel any pain.
She thought immediately of Lord Connor, and the aristocrats stricken with the Lazarus Virus at the masquerade. She considered the man who’d fallen from the window at Connor’s mansion. She remembered what the Resurrectionist had told her. This was the Lazarus Virus.
She wondered if it could have spread beyond Connor’s. She’d only seen the one vial in the package from Connor’s safe, but it was a big envelope, and the vial was small. If this virus had spread throughout the city, there must have been more.
She felt sick. This was her fault. She had unwittingly stolen a deadly virus from Connor’s safe and given it to the Resurrectionists. And this is how they used it, she thought, looking around her broken neighbourhood with its boarded windows and panicked citizens.
She thanked the boy for the newspaper and strode down the street, hoping she could still find a cab. She eventually found one.
The driver drew a gun and squinted as he pointed it at her.
She held up her arms and halted.
“You one of 'em?” he asked.
She shook her head.
“No, sir. Just an ordinary lady with someplace to be.”
For a minute, he just stared at her, neither pulling the trigger nor lowering the gun. Eventually, he seemed to decide that she was telling the truth. He lowered the gun.
“You oughta get out of town,” he said, “City’s a dangerous place fer a lady like you.”
“Seems like it’s a dangerous place for anyone,” she said.
“That it is,” he admitted.
“I’m lucky to have found you,” she told him. “I’m guessing there aren’t too many drivers willing to brave the streets right now.”
“Ye’d be surprised,” the driver huffed. “A man needs to make a livin’.”
“Even when the world is falling apart?”
“‘specially then,” he said.
“What’s happening?” she asked him. If anyone knew what was going on in this city, it would be the carriage drivers.
“Don’t rightly know, Miss,” said the driver. “Seems a bunch o’ folks ‘ave lost their minds. Attackin’ perfectly decent folks wivvout rhyme or reason.”
“Were they sick? Did they look dead?” Annabel asked.
“Don’t know, Miss. Only know what I’ve 'eard.”
“You haven’t seen them yourself, then?”
“No, ma’am, thank the Lord. Expect we’ll be seein' ‘em along the way. You sure you need to make this trip?”
Annabel nodded. “I’m sure.”
“Alright then,” said the driver. “Where to?”
“Do you know the way to Grimmer and Sons?” she asked.
“Does the pope wear a funny hat?”
Annabel grinned. Without hesitation, she got into the hackney. “I’ll take that as a yes,” she said.
The sidewalk was wet from last night’s rain, and a light fog had settled over the city, casting the deserted streets in a hazy grey light. Annabel looked out the window as the carriage rolled along.
London was Annabel’s city. She’d lost her parents at such a young age she could no longer remember their faces. With no remaining family, she’d slipped through the cracks of society and landed on the streets. London was an enormous city, each brick built upon layers of history. Her city had seen the fall of Rome, it had survived the black plague, and it had endured the great fire of 1666. Beneath its streets were forgotten graveyards of ancient bones, bricked over and buried beneath the new. New streets, new tenements, new warehouses. New factories, which belched black smoke from their chimneys.
As the carriage rattled along the cobbles, Annabel watched as her city’s familiar streets passed through the window. The streets didn’t look the same now. As in her own neighbourhood, windows were either boarded up or broken. A hanging sign to a tea house on the corner had been torn off. There were shards of broken glass and planks of wood littering the streets. She saw a pile of something lying on the road. As they drew near, she saw crows picking at it, and realized what it was. A dead body.
The cab carried on, past the blacking factory. As a child, Annabel had broken into it and slept on its bare floor; she’d awoken with nearly a dozen rats crawling over her. She managed to catch one of them, and had sold it for a penny to old Mr. Shorehill who owned the pie shop across the street.
As an adult, Annabel had stalked the city’s underground. There were entrances, if you knew where to find them, which descended into hidden tunnels that ran through the city; some of these tunnels had been discovered when Bazelgette built his sewer system, others when Brunel built the Thames Tunnel. When Annabel had stolen a painting from the British Museum, she’d gotten into the basement via a passageway known only to her. She thought of that now, as the carriage trundled on, past the museum, not far from Lord Connor’s.
As they passed Lincoln’s Inn Fields, she stood in her seat to see if she could spot Connor’s mansion, but she couldn’t.
Suddenly the horses whinnied, and they came to a sudden, jerking stop. Annabel turned around. She slid open the window at the front of the carriage and called out to the coachman, who sat on a seat at the front of the vehicle.
"What's going on?" she called.
“Sorry, Miss,” he answered, “Gonna have to take a detour.”
As they turned, Annabel got a better view of the situation. The street ahead of them was crowded with people. She adjusted the settings on her mechanical eye; the lens shifted until she could see the mob more clearly. As they shifted into focus, she saw that they were infected. They seemed to move as one, staggering forward on limbs wet with rot, staring hungrily with their dead eyes.
There were hundreds of them.</Text>

The vial that had been used at the masquerade had been enough to spread contaminated gas throughout the Connor mansion. She’d assumed that vial had been only one. But if this virus had spread throughout the city, there must have been more vials in the envelope. How many were there? How many citizens had been infected?

removed:

She was thinking about the man who’d fallen from the second story window, only to rise again. His limbs broken, his eyes hungry. The same condition as Lord Connor. If Annabel hadn’t seen the crow-faced men spraying whatever it was they kept in that perfume bottle, and if she were a more superstitious woman, she might have given in to her instinctive thought, that Lord Connor and the man with broken limbs had not been living.
Of course, she knew better. Lord Connor hadn’t been undead. He’d been afflicted by a virus. Lazarus.

 She would have to track down her new friend and find out for sure.

            <Text>Now, they'd finally found the Mason Jar Man's home.  And here were the missing jars.  The smell increased as he approached them.  The flies swarmed in thick black clouds around the bookshelf.
"In here," he called to Filch, but without waiting for the man to join him, he kept moving toward the jars.  The walls became brighter as he approached their light, until he could see the torn wallpaper, stained with blood both fresh and old.  There were clumps of hair, glued to the wall by blood.  But he kept his attention on the jars.  He reached out and took one off the shelf when he was close enough to do so.
They were not fireflies in the jars.  Not insects at all.  The phosphorescent glow came from something insubstantial, wispy, which floated like hydrogen.  He began to twist off the lid.  There was something uncanny about the glowing gas inside the jars, something which disturbed Joe greatly, but his instincts as a Private Eye made him want to investigate rather than replace the jar upon its shelf.  When the lid popped off, a chill passed through him.  The gas escaped from the jar, but it floated not like gas but like a shadow.  The second it was out of the jar, the flies were in a frenzy.  Like piranhas, they consumed it, and it was gone.
"What in the name of..." said Joe to himself.  A moment later, his attention was demanded by a sound from the other room.  Filch and Miss Belmont had yet to join him.  "What's going on over there?"
He hurried back down the hall, taking another jar with him to use as a lantern.  He rounded the corner, into the living room, where both Filch and Miss Belmont lay dead on the floor.  Their throats were slit, their eyes cut out, in the style of the Mason Jar Man's victims.  
Standing over them, a man in a long black coat, held an empty jar to Miss Belmont's mouth, whispering something Joe couldn't make out.  The man had his back to Joe, so he couldn't see his face.
He held up his glowing mason jar with one hand, raised his pistol with the other.  "Step away from him," he warned the Mason Jar Man.
"You shouldn't a opened it," he said, not stepping away.  "Mighta let ye live.  But now I got me another jar needs fillin'."
"Back the hell away," said Joe.  As he watched, that glowing gas escaped Miss Belmont's lips like a breath of warm air on a cold night.
"And she shouldn't a broken 'er 'usband's jar, neither."  Miss Belmont's breath filled the jar, and the murderer sealed it inside, screwing the lid on tight.  "What is that?" asked Joe.
At last, the Mason Jar Man turned around.  "Her sins," he said, grinning.
Joe had always considered himself a brave man, but he shied away now.  He took a few steps back in a real hurry.  The Mason Jar Man was no man at all.  He was a devil.
That smile of his, with wickedly sharp teeth, like criss-crossing needles.  His eyes so thickly covered with flies that there might not have been eyes there at all.
Finally, Joe found his courage.  He raised his pistol and fired.  Either he'd missed or the bullet had no effect on this devil.  He fired again.  And again.  Until the chamber of his gun was empty, and the Mason Jar Man was still standing.
"Gimme the jar," he said, "An' I'll make it quick-like."
Joe shook his head.  "You killed them both," he said.  "These were good people."
"Ain't no such thing as good people," said the Mason Jar Man.  "Hand it over, Joe."
The Mason Jar Man's breath was rancid, and he had to stifle a gag.  "You think I'm going to make this easy for you?  You want to put my sins in a jar?  Well," he growled, smashing the jar in his hand into shards and raising the broken jar as a weapon.  "You're going to need a bigger jar."</Text>

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Synopsis>Roderick arrives at the Grimmer company, intending to ask Mr. Grimmer about the Mysteries of Allen’s Street, and instead discovers the entrance to the basement.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Though the Resurrectionists had taken pains to clean up the mess that had been left behind by the escaped prisoners, a few flecks of blood still spattered the driveway of the printing company. While Roderick knew nothing of what had transgressed, he nonetheless noted the blood-stained drive. It could have been something as innocuous as a nosebleed. Then again, Roderick was not about to make any assumptions.
He simply stepped around the blood spots, climbed the front steps, and swung the door open, stepping into the lobby with the casual ease of a man with a scheduled appointment. Brushing past the receptionist, he swept into the hallway.
“Roderick Steen, to see Mr. Grimmer,” he said to quiet her objections; she’d gotten up from her desk and was attempting to bar his path.
“Mr. Grimmer?” she said.
“Mr. Grimmer,” Roderick said. “He’s expecting me.”
The receptionist’s mouth hung open. Roderick raised an eyebrow, feigning ignorance.
“What?”
“Well, he can’t very well be. Mr. Grimmer passed away.”
“Naturally, I meant the son.”
“Oh, of course,” said the receptionist, suddenly embarrassed. “You meant Jonathan Grimmer.”
“That’s the one!” Roderick said triumphantly, as if he’d known this all along, had the name on the tip of his tongue. “Yes, Mr. Jonathan Grimmer is expecting me. Not Mr. Charles Grimmer. Wouldn’t that be grimmer indeed?”
The poor girl forced a laugh.
“Very good, sir,” she said. “But Mr. Jonathan Grimmer isn’t in either, I’m afraid.”
“No matter,” said Roderick. “I’ll simply wait in his office.”
Before she could object, he stepped around her, made his way into the hallway, and headed down it.
“Thank you,” he called as he continued along the hall. A moment later, he popped back into the lobby. “Which door is it?”
With an exasperated sigh, she at least took pity on him.
“Last door on the left.”
He flashed his teeth at her, mouthed the word thanks, and returned to the hallway, making his way to the appropriate door. The office was still labeled with name of its current owner’s father.
He stepped into the office and closed the door, even going so far as to lock it. He didn’t wish to be interrupted, and he could always use the excuse that he had locked it by mistake if someone happened upon the locked door.
He set down his copy of Tales of Dead London, taken from Lord Connor’s mansion, folded his cane under the pit of his arm, and strode purposefully over to Mr. Grimmer’s bookshelf. Grimmer had his own copy of the penny dreadful, unremarkable on its own, but compared to Lord Connor’s edition, it was notably different in a couple of ways. First, Grimmer’s copy was larger by far, both thicker and taller. Second, while it appeared to be made of paper, there were tiny screws sticking into its spine, hidden to the unobservant but plain as day to the master detective.
He grabbed the book, thinking its interior might contain some further clue, but rather than sliding easily off the shelf, the book pulled out at an angle and clicked into place at a forty-five degree angle and would budge no further.
The book must have activated a switch, hidden behind the shelf. A hidden panel in the floor began to lift up, and the cacophonous sound of an enormous machine began to swell like the crescendo of an excessively percussive orchestra. When it was finished, a metal cage stood in the centre of the room where the hidden panel had been.
“Well, that is not what I was expecting,” Roderick observed.
The cage door opened easily. He stepped inside and looked around the strange contraption. There was a hanging lamp and a pull-switch, the only features of note. Roderick activated each in turn, the lamp flickering to life and the switch causing the machine to rattle noisily.
Barely perceptible above the din of the elevator, Roderick heard someone banging firmly on the door.
A loud voice, shouting, “Why did you let him in?”
“I’m sorry. I just thought…”
The receptionist’s voice faded until it was entirely indistinguishable against the noise of the elevator, as Roderick descended.
Well, fiddlesticks, he thought. It would have been much more convenient if he could have made it down to wherever this elevator was taking him, without anyone knowing he had discovered it. Especially if, as Roderick strongly suspected, the Resurrectionists were indeed tied to the Grimmer Company. This elevator, he thought, might be the members entrance to the Murder Club. And Roderick was most assuredly not a member. He readied his cane as the elevator rattled its way down to the basement.
Finally, just as Roderick was beginning to suspect that the elevator was actually taking him down into the ninth layer of hell, the narrow chamber widened into a room. An office, identical to the one upstairs. Luckily, the room was deserted, quiet.
He wanted to stop anyone from following him down here, but he didn’t want to destroy his only means of egress. So while it occurred to him to tamper with the elevator, he decided he would have to leave it. Which meant that he would have to hurry. He stepped out of the elevator, gave a cursory glance over the office, and headed for the door.</Text>
            <Notes>Rewrite some of this: Roderick knows that Charles Grimmer is already dead.
Removed, therefore, the following:
 Roderick had a vague recollection of the man’s name appearing in an obituary a few weeks ago. Despite a mimetic memory brimming with a practically encyclopedic wealth of trivial knowledge, Roderick was only human. And lately he’d had a lot on his mind and little in the way of sleep. Still, now that he thought about it, he did vaguely remember the announcement of Charles Grimmer’s death. Given his recent discovery of a connection between Mr. Grimmer and the late Resurrectionist Lord Connor, Roderick wondered if there might be some significance to the death of the former.</Notes>

            <Title>Scene Three</Title>
            <Text>Jonathan’s mother had taken the liberty of clearing out her husband’s old office in order for Jonathan to move in, which was more of a nuisance than a help. He’d still wanted to sort through his father’s old files. Last night, he’d settled into his father’s leather chair, a comfortable groove set into the seat from years of use, intending to look for answers but instead drifting into a deep slumber.
Now, the distinctive rhythm of the Agency’s machinery roused him from his sleep. The almost-musical clang of the printing press resonated down the hall to his office, signalling that the day’s operations had begun. He sat up and stretched. He’d hung his coat on the arm of the chair. He fished into the pockets and took out the two letters from Lord Connor, thinking there might still be some clue there that he’d missed before.
The Resurrectionists were like ghosts. Practically impossible to trace, it was nothing short of astounding that he’d discovered Lord Connor’s attachment to them. But that lead had died. And the next best thing, Parson Sinews, had been arrested for the murder of Lord Henry Connor, a murder which Jonathan knew to have been committed by another man. Mr. Monday.
If Jonathan wanted to clear his name, to track down Dr. Allen, to find out why Parson Sinews had been implicated, to unravel the mysteries of the Resurrectionists, he needed to speak to Mr. Monday.
He set the letters back on his desk and pushed them away. If there was anything there that he’d missed, he couldn’t see it now.
Then, just as he was about to get out of his seat, something caught his eye. But it wasn’t anything in the letters. It was his beneath his father’s desk. A lever, like the ones he’d seen on sewing machines. He reached beneath the desk, took hold of the lever, and pulled on it with a ratcheting sound.
His mouth fell open. Along the edge of the red carpet, there was a circular groove notched into the hardwood floor. It began to twist open. The circular section of the floor began slowly to rise up with the heavy sound of wood grinding against wood.
Jonathan got out of his seat to get a better look at what was happening.
Peering into the gap in the floor as the single circular section of the floor continued to rise, he caught flashes of steel and brass.
“What on god’s green earth?” he muttered.
He could hear the sound, loud even against the din of the printing press from down the hall, of enormous gears turning from somewhere well below. It was almost like the sound of a clock tower, or the turning wheels of a locomotive. The mechanical clang of an enormous machine coming to life.
“A secret elevator,” he realised, as it rose up to fill the the gap in the floor.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Annabel confronts Palmer, who reveals that he has remained loyal to the Resurrectionists after all. Annabel beats the crap out of him. She runs into Anthony Tidkins.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Annabel stared hard at Abraham Palmer. Although she’d never trusted him for a second, she still felt betrayed. She realized it was because she was thinking of how Jonathan felt about Palmer. Jonathan had trusted Palmer with his life. He would be devastated when he learned of Palmer’s deceit.
“Kick the crossbow over here,” he said.
She did as she asked without arguing.
“And your other guns,” he said, gesturing meaningfully at the pistols in her belt.
She did as he asked. Tense silence followed, as he continued to point his gun at her. She wondered if this was how she was going to die. After all the zombies she’d encountered, the thought that she’d be killed by a living, breathing human being seemed a cruel twist of fate.
“Why?” she wanted to know.
He shrugged.
“At first, I really was loyal to Charles Grimmer and his secret society. I truly believed we could fight back against the Resurrectionists from the inside, as did Mrs. Grimmer. But we were too late. I’m simply trying to be realistic, as we should have done from the onset. Much as I’d love to see them pay for what they’ve done, we need them. I truly believe they are our best chance.”
“You saved my life,” she said. “You helped me get out of this place. You shot at your fellow Resurrectionists. You took a bullet for me!”
“Yes, well, that wasn’t the plan,” he admitted. “And I only helped you to keep Jonathan from getting caught up in all this. Whatever you may think of me, you should know that I never meant for Jonathan to get hurt.”
“So what happens now? Are you going to kill me?”
“Guess we’ll see what Anthony Tidkins wants to do with you. Maybe he’ll want to ship you off to Chateau D’If to join Mr. Sinews.”
He gestured with the gun, directing her to the hallway. He closed the door behind him, keeping his gun trained on her all the while. But even with the gun pointed at her, this might be her best chance to regain control of the situation.
She stepped towards him suddenly, sidestepping to anticipate his gunshot. As predicted, Palmer’s eyes widened, and he pulled the trigger. The bullet grazed her left arm, and exploded into a test tube behind her.
Wincing in pain, she struck at his gun arm. The weapon flew from his hand. She watched as it slid along the floor, well out of reach. She slammed her knee into Mr. Palmer’s gut. He doubled over, but she wasn’t finished with him yet. She followed up with an uppercut to his jaw with her mechanical arm, knocking a tooth loose.
He spat blood onto the floor and retaliated with a right hook, catching her off guard. He hit her cheek, and she staggered back. Even as she was struggling to regain her balance, he hit her again, this time square in the eye. He hit her again, each blow more brutal than the last. She fell to the floor.
She watched as he turned away from her, slowly, confidently making his way to the gun. She crawled to her feet. The scientists, recognizing that the tables had turned, had retrieved their weapons, and had them pointed at Annabel. Dr. Jekyll, fortunately, was unarmed, and was preoccupied with breathing through his oxygen tank. Palmer was headed over to grab his gun.
“I’m not finished with you yet,” she told him.
He paused, turned around, and scoffed at her. Her lip was bloody, her eye was swollen. She looked like she could barely stand upright. He turned away, again going for the gun.
Sizing up the scientists whose guns were trained on her, she slowly backed towards the door.
“Stop!” they warned her, but she kept backing up, until she had reached the door. Still, they didn’t shoot. Finally, she turned around and dashed through the door. As she did, they began to fire, but she was through the door before they began firing.
She ducked into the hallway. They ceased fire, and Annabel took a moment to wipe the blood from her nose. She listened as a set of footsteps made their way to the door. A moment later, Palmer strode through the door, gun pointed. Annabel was waiting.
She grabbed Palmer’s wrist, twisted it until he was forced to drop it. He cried out in surprise. He must have been expecting her to run. He probably thought he’d be able to shoot her in the back while she was running away. But Annabel wasn’t interested in running away.
She leveled a kick at Palmer’s shin, making him cry out in pain. She thought she heard the crunch of bone. She hoped she’d broken something.
Palmer limped, grasping his leg, and tried to retreat into the lab. Annabel attacked while his back was turned, this time kicking him hard in the soft spot behind the knee. He hit the ground hard and landed on his knee. Annabel gave him a hard shove on the back, and Palmer fell flat on his face.
She grabbed the gun, relieved to feel it in her hand.
She stood up, aimed the gun at the back of Palmer’s skull, and cocked the pistol. But before she could pull the trigger, she heard a voice from behind her, muffled by a Resurrectionist’s mask.
In the heat of the moment, she’d almost forgotten where she was. She should have been on the lookout for more Resurrectionists. She kept her foot on Palmer’s back to keep him pinned to the floor, and looked over her shoulder. She felt her heart leap up into her throat.
How he’d crept up on her so silently, she hadn’t the slightest idea, but she recognized him immediately.
His mask was strapped to his head, but he’d pulled it up so that it sat atop his forehead instead of on his face. It was him. Anthony Tidkins. The Resurrection Man. Scientist, leader of the Resurrectionists. The man who destroyed London.
“Jack,” she breathed.</Text>

            <Text>The First Act
The first 20-25% of the book comprises your setup. At first glance, this can seem like a tremendous chunk of story to devote to introductions, but if you expect readers to stick with you throughout the story, you first have to give them a reason to care.

In Dead London:
Annabel tries to steal something from Lord Connor’s safe, only to have it later stolen by the Resurrectionists. Jonathan believes Lord Connor was a Resurrectionist and attends his party, hoping to question him, only to find him dead.

The Hook
The hook comes in many forms, but stripped down to its lowest common denominator, the hook is nothing more or less than a question. We’ve created a hook only when we’ve convinced readers to ask the general question, “What’s going to happen?” because we’ve also convinced them to ask a more specific question, such as “What scary reptilian monster killed the worker?”

In Dead London:
What did Annabel steal from Lord Connor? Who infected him with the zombie virus?

The First Plot Point
The first major plot point changes everything. But this isn’t just an event that happens to the protagonist. This is an event that either incorporates or is directly followed by the character’s reacting in a strong and irrevocable way. This is the point of no return for the major character; after this, they can no longer return to life as they know it.

In Dead London:
Jonathan learns that his father was murdered by the Resurrectionists and that they intend to destroy London with the Lazarus Virus.

The First Half of the Second Act
This first half of the second act is where your characters find the time and space to react to the first major plot point. That reaction, which will lead to another reaction and another and another, launches your second act.

The Midpoint
This is where everything changes for the protagonist. This all-important turning point in the Second Act provides him with a new understanding of the conflict, the antagonistic force, and his own goals in relation to them. Suddenly, he gets it.
</Text>
            <Notes>Inciting Event and Key Event
The first quarter of your story hinges upon two important and irreversible moments: the inciting event and the key event. These events can take place at any number of the structure points. “The inciting incident… sets the story in motion … [while] the key incident [is] what the story is about, and draws the main character into the story line.” The key event is the moment when the character becomes engaged by the inciting event. For example, in most detective stories, the inciting event (the crime) takes place apart from the main character, who doesn’t become involved with it until the key event,
when he takes on the case. Generally, we find two schools of thought on the proper location for the inciting event. Either it’s supposed to be found in the hook in the first chapter, no exceptions, or it’s supposed to be the first plot point at the 25% mark, no exceptions.

Pinch Point
At their most basic level, Pinch Points are nothing more or less than a reminder of the antagonistic force’s power to stymie the protagonist’s goal. They provide new information to the plot that begins setting up the major events in the Midpoint and Third Plot Point. They also act as important foreshadowing for the confrontations that will play out during these Plot Points and during the Climax.

            <Synopsis>Finally, Annabel confronts Dr. Simms, who reveals that Jack was the bastard son of Dr. Allen and Mrs. Grimmer, while Jonathan was also born of an affair and is not truly Mrs. Grimmer’s son. Jack’s Dead London plan was concocted to save his dying father, and Mrs. Grimmer was complicit because Jack is her son and Dr. Allen was her lover. She hated Jonathan because he was not her son and reminded her of her husband’s unfaithfulness and the fact that she’d given up her own son while he’d not done the same.

Following this revelation, Annabel and Abraham run into Jack. Annabel puts a bullet in his skull, while the unliving begin to fill the halls of the underground.</Synopsis>

</Text>
            <Notes>Where to begin? For starters, try to find a way to portray Abraham Palmer as the betrayer in their midst. He was playing both sides, pretending to be on Annabel’s side only to get her out of the way until the plan could be put in motion.

Reveal that Dr. Simms’ memory loss is not indicative of the serum’s effects. The only clear symptom is a physical sign - a discolouration of the skin. This means it’s possible for people to conceal that they are brainwashed. In other words, Palmer may have lied.

Can I still also reveal that Jack’s father was really Dr. Allen? Can I reveal that Mrs. Grimmer was his mother? Not sure if possible.</Notes>

            <Text>Jonathan didn’t much care for air travel. He’d been born on the ground, and that was where he felt most comfortable. Ordinarily he’d have plied his nerves with absinthe and other comforts. But tonight he felt safer in the air than he’d felt on the ground. Safer than he’d felt since his eyes first fell upon the pair of letters.
The Penny Dreadful was lavish, even by Jonathan’s standards. Furnished with antique furniture that was surprisingly comfortable and apparently quite expensive. Or so he was told; Jonathan was hardly an expert in antiques, nor in furniture. There was also a fully stocked bar, at one end of the room. But Jonathan had ordered a cup of tea, rather than his usual glass of absinthe. The bartender had seemed somewhat taken aback, but he’d prepared the tea as asked.
He sat now, dry and in a fresh change of clothes, in the passenger’s lounge, upon a settee, drinking his tea as he watched the darkness of London pass by through the window. It seemed, from where he sat, that it was the city that was moving and not the airship. The ship was steady enough that his teacup hardly rattled as it sat upon the table at his side.
He’d lost track of how many times he’d already read Lord Connor’s letters, but he unfolded the first of them again, and let his eyes linger on the words scrawled hastily upon the pages once again.

Dear Charles Grimmer,

I have long been thinking of writing you, my old friend, and regret that I have delayed so long in doing so. How long has it been since we served together in the war? Some ten years or more, I imagine, but it feels like much longer. A lifetime, really, don’t you think? Still, not a day goes by that I don’t think about that day on the battlefield, when, putting your own safety at risk, you saved me from certain death at the hands of a savage who had broken through our lines and seemed ready to rush me from behind with the tip of a spear.
How precious a gift life is, is made more all the more clear when you have come as close to death as we have. Those of us who have known war, who have seen our friends die before our eyes, we are the lucky ones, for we know what it means to be alive.
But a greater gift still, a greater gift even than life itself, is that great and terrifying joy that we call love. In the many years since I last wrote you, I do hope that you have found it for yourself. I am writing to let you know of my own great joy, which I have found in a young lady by the name of Marianne Cunningham. She is delightful, Charles, I know you would love her instantly.    She makes me feel as young as a child when I am with her. She is both pretty and intelligent, as well as strong-willed and possessing of a clever sense of humour. And I know you will be thrilled on my behalf when I tell you that we are to be married.
I do hope that you will be able to attend the wedding, but even more so, I hope that you will accept my invitation, to visit us at my home in the country. Please write at once to say that you will come. Do bring your own wife, if such a lovely creature exists. I will await your reply with great expectation.

Your old friend,
Harry Connor

Jonathan folded the letter shut and turned to the second one. Though the penmanship was the same, it was difficult to recognise that its author was the same as the first, so different was the subject and the tone.

Dear Mr. Charles Grimmer, editor at Grimmer and Sons

A few weeks ago, your newspaper, The Weekly Gazette, reported what it described as a murder. You spoke in that condescending tone of yours, of the heinousness of the crimes inflicted upon the so-called victim, Marianne Connor. You described with disgust the mutilation of her body, the disembowelment, the removal of her limbs, and the surgical attachment of scientific apparatuses that are clearly well beyond your own comprehension.
But Mrs. Connor’s death was not murder. It was not gruesome, heinous, violent, or criminal. Her death was not tragic. It was not disturbing. The man who killed her was not psychotic, not some raving lunatic. I do not claim that her death was just or deserved, but it was not done with malice or evil intent.
You journalists, you vultures, you sharks, you who seek nothing but blood to increase the circulation of your papers, do not surprise me by failing to understand. But Anthony Tidkins' vindication is in the hands of the papers alone, and so it falls to me to explain this to you. The difference between vile murder and scientific study.
First, you must do away with that foolish notion of yours, that life is a precious thing to be guarded at all costs. It is not. Without permanence, nothing is of consequence. Think of Ozymandias and of his inevitable decline. If death cannot be prevented, what can it matter if a life is taken by force?
Your counterargument, I am sure, is that when a man commits murder he is robbing his victim of a few more days, perhaps years more, of joy. Surely, you believe that is indeed a crime. And to inflict terror and pain upon a person in their last moments, surely you will say that this is wrong too. This is vile, horrendous, evil. I will not argue with you here. To take a life in such a violent fashion without any great reason for doing so can only be considered evil, even if it is of no real consequence.
But in the case of the Resurrection Man, I assure you, things are quite different from how they seem. The difference I speak of is that Mrs. Connor was not a victim but the subject of an experiment, an experiment with such grand implications that should his tests yield the results for which we hope, life itself would take on meaning, and the Resurrection Man would cease to be considered as a murderer. For when God lets his children die, one does not say that God is a murderer. Instead, it is said that His motivations are beyond our understanding.
The same holds true for Anthony Tidkins. But only wait and see. Wait and see what his motivations are, wait to see the fruits of his labour. God gave man His only son and promised us eternal life in Heaven. But the Resurrection Man will give us more than that. He will give us eternal life on Earth.

Francis Varney

Jonathan folded this letter closed as well, and picked up his cup of tea as if to take a sip. But he let the cup linger at his lips, deep in thought. It was astonishing how drastically Lord Connor’s outlook had changed between writing the first and the second letter. It was truly as if he’d transformed, like Jekyll into Hyde, into another person. As if he really was Francis Varney. Most disturbing was his indifference to the murder of his own wife. The joy that Marianne Connor had brought him, as described in the first letter, was replaced with a dehumanizing scientific pursuit, and a cult-like reverence of Dr. Allen. Jonathan thought of the serum that Parson Sinews had mentioned.
Once again, Allen’s name had come up. At first, Jonathan’s interest in the doctor himself had been nothing more than a means of tracking the Resurrectionists and hopefully of discovering further evidence of Lord Connor’s involvement with that nefarious society. But it seemed that Allen was becoming more and more a person of interest.
According to Mr. Sinews, he was the head of the Resurrectionists. It was his murders that had captured public attention and generated interest in the Resurrectionists, but they had also captured the interest of the police, turned them into criminals rather than mere radicals. And apparently, he had murdered Connor’s wife, though Connor seemed not to have minded.
Again, Jonathan thought of the serum. If Connor’s devotion to the Resurrectionists had been a result of drug-induced brainwashing, then it stood to reason that he had no longer been under the influence of the drugs when they’d had him killed. If he was still under their influence, they’d have had no need to dispose of their fellow member. Then again, he’d apparently tried to eat Mr. Monday, which was hardly the behaviour of a man not under the influence of drugs. He shook his head. It was getting harder and harder to think.
“Captain,” said Jonathan, getting out of his seat. He set his tea back down upon the side table. “I need to speak with the captain,” he said, getting the attention of a crew member.
“Yes, sir,” the young man replied, and disappeared into the hallway.
Jonathan settled back into his chair. His tea was already getting cold. He swallowed the rest of it and let his attention wander back to the letters once more. He didn’t bother to unfold them again. He knew their contents well enough.
He’d told Ocelot that there was someone he needed to speak to. And there was. The trouble though, was that he didn’t know where to find him. In fact, he didn’t even know the man’s real name. Or what his face looked like, beneath the mask. All he had to go on was the name Monday.
But there was still another lead. Maybe.
The door swung open, and Captain Merrick strode into the room. Again, Jonathan got to his feet. He almost saluted, but he was no military man. But the Captain did cut an impressive figure, and stirred the impulse to salute him.
Tall, masculine, and rugged, dressed in a finely cut uniform of rich browns accented with green and copper. He wore an aviator’s cap upon his greying hair, strapped beneath his whiskered chin. A pair of goggles hung loose around his neck. The man had once been a sailor, but had turned his attention to aeronautics some years ago, when Jonathan’s father offered him a position as the printing company’s aeronaut. He’d been reluctant to give up the sea, apparently, but had taken to the skies with ease and never looked back since.
His voice was gruff. “Mr. Grimmer,” he said, halting in front of Jonathan.
“Captain, you know the ins and outs of this city better than anyone I know,” Jonathan began.
“Thank you, sir,” the captain replied, but he raised an eyebrow as he waited for the followup.
“Parson Sinews. Heard of him?”
Here the captain seemed to pause, if only for a moment, to think of if and where he had heard the name before.
“The name rings a bell,” he said.
“I don’t suppose you would know an address.”
Merrick shook his head. “Mr. Sinews is a man of somewhat ill repute. A gentleman, by birth and wealth alone. He associates with criminals and reprobates, and is rumoured to haunt the many opium dens of Henry Ocelot. You might find him there. Although I warn you, there are other stories. Some say that Parson Sinews is a vampire, and that he drinks the blood of the living.”
“And others say he’s Dr. Allen.”
“I hadn’t heard that story, sir,” Merrick replied, “But if you’re determined to meet Mr. Sinews, I could direct you to one of the opium dens he’s known to frequent.”
Jonathan paused.
“I’d hoped to visit the man’s home,” he said, “Though I confess I’d hoped he wouldn’t be there when I did.”
“Ah.” Merrick nodded. “A wise plan, if I may say so. But what is it you were hoping to find?”
“Dr. Allen,” Jonathan replied. “And while I don’t believe the story that Mr. Sinews is actually him, I do know him to be an expert on the man. I’d hoped he might have something useful at his home. Letters, newspaper clippings, broadsides, that sort of thing. But if his address is not an option, I don’t believe I’ll find him at his usual haunts either. Mr. Sinews was arrested.”
“The prison, then, Mr. Grimmer? If you wish to speak to Mr. Sinews directly?”
“Unfortunately, that option is similarly problematic. Remember, I am still a fugitive. Then again,” Jonathan paused. He turned to the crewman who had summoned the captain on his behalf. “Lockwood, is it?”
“Yes, sir,” said the crewman.
“How do you feel about a visit to Newgate on my behalf?” He returned his attention to the captain. “It would be Newgate, wouldn’t it?”
Merrick nodded. “I suspect so. We’ll try there first, at any rate, and if he’s not there, we’ll try every other prison till we find him. Shall we drop you off at home first, sir? I imagine you could do with some rest.”
Jonathan smiled. “You imagine correctly. It’s been a long night. A long, long night.”</Text>
            <Comments>Possibly delete this scene. If not, revisions will definitely be necessary.
Page 45, it is indicated that Jonathan doesn’t like Heights or like to travel by air ship.  The words are different but upon reading them I thought for a moment that maybe part of the book started to repeat itself.

Its fine if you want to stress again that he doesn’t like heights or isn’t a fan of the airship.  I suggest to move this down and start with “The Penny Dreadful was lavish”
Suggestion, so long as the letters are not vital to the story, maybe you should just provide a summary and Jonathan can note the changes in tone?
…anachronistic terms and phrases. I don’t know exactly when the story is set, but I get the impression of the first half of the 1890s.  Here is a list of what I noticed.  I used the Online Etymology Dictionary as my reference.   Brainwash, Urban Legend, Clone, Frame, Blown Cover, Demographics.
- P. Aloysius Regnad
Why is it so important that he find Monday?  Is it because Monday is a link to the Ressurectionists?  Be a good idea to remind the readers.
Technically the police did not discover him with the body, it was the Ressurectionists.  Jonathan was also witness to Parsons being arrested for the murder of Lord Connor.  It would be safe to assume that the police are not looking at Jonathan.  However, Jonathan SHOULD be worried about the Ressurectionists finding him. In that sense he should be careful.</Comments>

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>Bells jingled from the doorway, announcing the arrival of a newcomer. The conversation quickly died on the lips of all but one, who continued his speech uninterrupted. With that singular exception, everyone turned to see a very damp Dr. Tidkins shuffling through the doorway and shedding his jacket. The temporary lull in conversation was filled with the noise of Tidkins wiping his rain-soaked feet on the mat in the doorway in a half-hearted show of politeness, and with the drunken slur of Mr. Steen's tirade. Pardoning himself for the interruption and for his tardiness, Dr. Tidkins shook the hand of each of the gentlemen at the table, not excepting the uninterruptible Mr. Steen, and finally took his seat.
“Terribly sorry,” he began, “I must have hired half a hundred cabs before I found a driver who would admit to the existence of this god-forsaken street. Might I ask, whose idea was it that we meet here, of all places?”
“No apology necessary. Punctuality is a flaw of character; it requires that responsibilities take precedence over idle pleasures. And there is nothing as intolerable as self denial. Therefore I will not stand for punctuality, if it can be avoided.”
“Mr. Tidkins, have you met Mr. Sinews?” asked Mr. Grimmer, referring to the man who had spoken – a handsome man with an ivory-white complexion and thickly lashed eyes, an irrepressible grin plastered on his face that suggested an ironic or perhaps sardonic sense of humor. “It is by his invitation that we’ve convened here.”
“A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Sinews,” Tidkins replied without the necessary inflection to suggest even a modicum of sincerity.
“Please, call me Parson,” said Mr. Sinews, “Parson by name, not profession.”
“Then you’re not of the religious persuasion?” Tidkins queried, with irony enough in his inflection to counter Parson’s own. “How surprising,” he muttered under his breath.
Mr. Grimmer coughed. “Mr. Sinews, as you may know, is the head of this organisation. And I believe he was just about to inform us of the purpose of this meeting,” he said.
“And, Mr. Sinews, for once spare us the gruesome details, if you please. I do hope to be able to keep my dinner,” warned Mrs. Hatton. An age-spotted finger wagged in his direction, though Mrs. Hatton was all smiles.
Mr. Sinews grinned. “The world craves the grotesque. Those who pretend otherwise only deceive themselves,” he said.
“Very amusing, Mr. Sinews,” said Grimmer, “As always.”
“I do aim to please,” said Mr. Sinews. He paused to accept a refill of his drink. Unlike the majority of the gentlemen, Mr. Sinews was not drinking tea. He and Steen alone were drinking absinthe, and they were drinking it quite heavily, in spite of the fact that this was a tea house and not a pub. Their hosts had graciously provided beverages that were not on the menu. They had also closed and locked the front door and placed a sign in the window, which read “Closed.”
“The story takes place here, on Allen’s Street,” Mr. Sinews began, “A street so named both for and by the doctor who was supposed to have practiced here. But forgive me. I’m sure you already know this. After all, it is the reason for our mutual acquaintanceship.”
His eyes swept over the room. All eyes were on him now. Even Steen had quieted to listen. Including himself, there were five gentlemen at the table: Anthony Tidkins, Edward Steen, Jonathan Grimmer, and Henry Ocelot, with the addition of Mrs. Marianne Hatton. It was a curious fellowship. That much could not be denied.
Seated to Sinews’ left, there was Henry Charles Ocelot, a businessman of ill repute but considerable wealth. The former Haitian slave and plantation worker had rough skin and scars covering most of his night-black face. The man’s thickly muscled neck was adorned with a necklace of brass-painted bone. His right eye was red as blood—even the whites of his eye were red. When he smiled, it revealed a set of yellowing teeth, many of them chipped or filled with gold.
The man could easily have been mistaken for a pirate, but in truth, the man was the owner of several establishments where a man might indulge himself in any number of deadly sins. For example, Mr. Ocelot had somehow managed to produce documents which supported his claim of being a legitimate pharmacist; his customers and clients were his patients, and they affectionately dubbed him The Apothecary. And in return, he doled out prescriptions for opium and cocaine—for a price, of course. Prostitution and gambling were also among his business ventures, and Ocelot was a genius at business, marketing, and against all odds avoiding around inconveniences like legality, morality, and the fact that he was a former Haitian slave.
Still, despite Ocelot’s business practices and appearances, the man himself was the perfect gentleman. Articulate, intelligent, and sharp-witted, he had a voice that was rich and deep but utterly smooth.
“Mr. H.C. Ocelot,” said Sinews, gesturing to the man, “I’m sure that most everyone here knows you, if not by association then at least by reputation. But what they surely don’t realize is your interest in the matter at hand.”
Mr. Ocelot scanned the room. “Do you know how I got these scars?” he asked in his booming voice.
A moment or two of uncomfortable silence passed, during which no one, not even Mr. Sinews, even considered answering the question. Sinews calmly sipped the sweet anise-flavoured liquor. Surely, everyone could guess at the answer to Ocelot’s question.
Immediately adjacent to Ocelot was Edward Steen. Steen, despite the degree of his intoxication and his utter lack of manners, was a man of considerably better reputation than Ocelot. He was not a gentleman, exactly, but he did work for Scotland Yard. He was not a police officer, per se, but due to his thorough knowledge on the subject of criminal psychology, he was often called upon as a civilian detective. Of course, he demanded a sizeable fee for his efforts, so he was only called in for especially difficult cases that the police couldn’t handle on their own. He also made himself available as an expert witness in court, also for a price. His interest in the matter was a bit more obvious and was scarcely worth mentioning.
“What exactly is your profession, Mr. Steen?” Sinews asked, taking the attention from Ocelot and bringing up what he knew to be a touchy subject.
By way of answer, Steen merely held out a finger, directed it vaguely in the direction of Sinews’ face, and fixed him with the most threatening of frowns that he could muster. He held that pose until Sinews was finally forced to answer his own question.
“You’ve called yourself a ‘Consulting Detective,’ on many occasions, haven’t you? I must imagine that to be somewhat similar to the work of a police officer, with the exception that you are not directly on Scotland Yard payroll and are therefore at leisure to accept any case that strikes your fancy. Is that not correct?” Being not contradicted by anything other than Steen lowering his finger and swallowing the last of his glass of absinthe, a gesture which most likely indicated agreement, Sinews continued. “I would wager, however, that your interest in the matter is purely recreational and not by contract with the police.”
Again, Steen made no contradiction but instead began to shout for the waiter to refill his cup, sparing no use of foul language.
“I might also point out that as you are not operating as an official agent of the police, that prevents you from making any arrests, but allows you to circumvent issues of jurisdiction that might otherwise hinder your investigation. Your role often involves dredging up evidence, in any way you can. That might even include fabricating or planting evidence. Is that correct?”
Still, Steen's silent treatment continued, and Sinews had to wonder if the man had even heard a word he’d said.
Finally, when his drink had been filled again, he broke his silence. “I solved the case of Jack The Ripper,” he said.
Mr. Sinews grinned. “Come again?”
“I said I solved the case of Jack The Ripper,” he said, loudly, and stifling a belch.
“Well,” said Tidkins, “Let’s hear it then.”
Steen snorted. “You don’t believe me,” he said, “I can see that. But I’ll tell you this. It was easy to crack the case. Easy.”
Dr. Tidkins leaned forward. “Consider my interest piqued,” he said.
“Jack The Ripper wasn’t a madman. He was a psychopath. And there’s a big difference between mad and psychopathic.”
“There is?”
“Jack The Ripper had the irresistible urge to kill. He couldn’t help himself. But he was clever, and he didn’t want to get caught. That’s why he picked his victims out of Whitechapel. Prostitutes.”
Mrs. Hatton gasped at the word, as if it was profane.
“Ladies of the night,” he amended, with a nod in her direction, “People who wouldn’t be too terribly missed when they went missing.”
“There were, if I am not mistaken,” said Mr. Sinews, “A series of letters written by the ripper himself and sent to members of the police. One letter in particular, as I understand, contained one of the kidneys of the murdered women, the other kidney apparently having been fried and eaten by the killer. This does not strike me as the work of a man who wishes to remain anonymous.”
“Doesn’t it?” said Steen, “No, I suppose not. The truth is that most of the letters claiming to be from Jack The Ripper were the inauthentic scribblings of the media, wishing to drum up interest in the case. Attention-seeking journalist scum—no offence, Mr. Grimmer.”
“But the letter with the kidney,” said Tidkins.
“That letter, I would guess, was authentic. See, the Ripper did not want to be caught. But he did want to brag. He wanted the world to know what he’d done. Murderers. Psychopaths anyway, they’re just like us; they crave power, above all else. But unlike ordinary folks, what makes them feel powerful is murder. The power to end someone’s life. The power to inspire terror. And the power to get away with it.”
“But Jack The Ripper,” Tidkins persisted, “You claim he did not get away. You claim you caught him.”
“Yes, well, I caught him too late. Jack The Ripper, as I said, killed out of compulsion. And yet, after a series of increasingly brutal murders and an increasingly public profile, he just disappeared. Stopped killing. How do you suppose that happens? You think he just quit, cold turkey?”
“You liken murder to addiction, Mr. Steen?”
“Yes, Mr. Tidkins, I do.”
“In that case, I would suppose what you’re saying is that Anthony was arrested for some other crime, assault with sodomitic intent or petty theft or what have you, and was hanged without ever being suspected of those most heinous crimes.”
“Precisely,” said Steen.
“Mrs. Hatton?” Sinews said, promptly dropping his interest in Steen, much to Steen’s immense annoyance.
“Well?” Steen interrupted.
“Mr. Steen, I believe you may be quite right, but your hypothesis can hardly be called original. Nonetheless your gift for criminal assessment and reasonable deduction may be useful in solving the at-present unsolved case at hand. If I may, for the moment, persuade you to extend Mrs. Hatton the same courtesy as she has done for you, by sitting quietly and hearing her story, I would be much obliged.”
Sinews smiled, and Steen begrudgingly quieted down.
Mrs. Hatton was the eldest in the company, a woman nearing fifty years of age who had the appearance of a woman no younger than sixty. Widowed several times over by a multitude of gentlemen half again twice her age and wealth, she was now dressed like a woman born into poverty and recently bestowed with richness. She was dressed garishly in the latest fashions and jewelry but with no understanding of style or accessorizing. Her cheeks were brightly blushed, and she wore a shade of bright pink around her eyes. Even to dine, she refused to remove her hat, a broad peacock feathered wide-brimmed chapeau which sat on an angle atop her greying auburn locks.
“As you well know, gentlemen,” she said, fixing her gaze only on Sinews, “I have ever been a victim of circumstance. And as you further know, society loves to blame the victim. I am not, as rumour would have you believe, a gold-digging murderess, intent on my husbands’ fortunes. But I have been abused with that notion; I have received every sort of punishment short of being locked away, for these crimes I am supposed to have committed. I have been outcast, nay, banished, from popular society—a pariah. I have long known the truth of my husbands’ deaths, even witnessed some of them, but I have always lacked the evidence to corroborate my claims. That is my goal. That is my interest in the matter.”
Having offered the most thorough, albeit melodramatic bordering on false, justification thus far, Mrs. Hatton settled back into her chair until she was comfortable again, and returned her attention to her tea.
“Mrs. Hatton,” said Mr. Sinews, coughing politely. “You know I hate to be contradictory, so I am most aggrieved to have to say this. You know what I always say. Honesty is a dreadful thing. One should never be honest. One should always be fanciful. The best things in life are always full of fancy. Still, just this once, I must ask you to be truthful. It is essential that we have all the facts.
“Mr. Sinews, I would never…”
“Please, Mrs. Hatton.”
“Oh, alright then,” she complained, “Well, the truth is, my first husband was not a wealthy man. And he was not an older man either. He was a clever man though, a doctor and an inventor from a very young age. He was never a cruel man, even in his work. He was not the sort of man to do the sort of things that…well, you know what I mean. I would never have suspected he could be capable of the sorts of things we’re here to discuss. But there are certain similarities between my husband and this Dr. Allen, which cannot be ignored.”
“For example?”
Mrs. Hatton sipped her tea, found it unsatisfying, and squeezed more lemon into it,
“When he was working as a doctor, he wore a mask over his face. A leather bird’s face, like the plague doctors used to wear.”
Mr. Sinews nodded. There was a collective look of understanding amongst everyone present.
“He believed his patients would feel more comfortable with a doctor in a mask than a doctor who was seventeen years of age.”
“He was—”
“When he first started practicing medicine, yes,” said Mrs. Hatton. “As I said, this was my first marriage. We were of an age.”
“And this husband of yours,” Mr. Sinews urged, “Was he called Allen?”
 “Not at the time,” she conceded, “No. But it’s possible he may have changed it, since then. His name was Jim, or rather, Dr. James Vane.”
“Mrs. Hatton,” said Mr. Sinews, as gently as he could manage, “What happened to your husband?”
“He vanished,” she said, “Disappeared without a trace.”
After thanking Mrs. Hatton for her answer, Mr. Sinews turned to Mr. Grimmer.
“Mr. Grimmer, as you know, gentlemen,” he began by way of introduction, “Is a reporter. His interest should therefore be obvious, but perhaps Mr. Grimmer can elaborate?”
John Grimmer was a young man, by far the youngest present. He was tall, fit, and boasted a well-manicured moustache. If any sort of reputation preceded him, it was limited solely to the world of journalism. However, he was the only man present who bridged the gap between all those in the fellowship. There was not a man or woman here who did not know him.
“I cannot, Mr. Sinews,” he replied, “I wish that I could, but I’m afraid that is the sum of it. Then again, I don’t think it’s relevant but I suppose I should mention, I’m a journalist by birth, not by interest. My father was a journalist as well, and he now owns and operates Grimmer And Sons Literary Agency and Printing Press.”
“Sons?” Mr. Sinews asked.
“Sounds better than Grimmer and Son, I suppose.”
“You ought to have been called Grimmer and Grimmer,” said Mr. Sinews.
Mr. Grimmer laughed. “At any rate, I’m an only child. Anyway, he mainly prints newspapers and cheap horror stories: penny dreadfuls and dime novels. Nothing of real literary or journalistic merit. Still, I’m to take over the business when my father retires.”
Sinews nodded. Once again he returned his attention, briefly, to the drink in front of him. He took another sip, not paying it much attention, and discovered he’d already emptied his glass. He raised his hand for the waiter.
“And Dr. Tidkins, that leaves only you,” said Mr. Sinews, turning his attention to the newcomer while he waited for his drink. “I’m afraid that Dr. Tidkins and I have not previously been acquainted. Perhaps an introduction is in order.”
“Forgive me for contradicting you, Parson, but you are quite wrong on both accounts. First, you have yet to explain your own interest in the matter. Second, we have in fact met before, on two separate occasions. Our first meeting was brief. It was in Paris. You and I had attended a performance of Hamlet and later happened to meet at the same gentleman’s club. You criticized the performance, calling it the most ‘singularly disappointing performance of Hamlet that you had ever had the displeasure of witnessing.’ I disagreed, calling you an impudent and ignorant swine, and informed you that you wouldn’t recognize a brilliant performance if it sprouted a cock and buggered you senseless.”
Mrs. Hatton nearly spilt her drink at that, as she made a show of pretending to faint.
Tidkins continued, while Grimmer supported the lady as she fluttered a paper fan in front of her face.
“Our second encounter was more recent but equally brief and just as infuriating. It was at the opera; I was not performing, of course, but attending as a member of the audience. Apparently an acquaintance of yours had spilt a glass of wine in your booth, and mistaking me for servant, you demanded that I clean up the spill. When I informed you that I was not working but attending the opera with my friends and associates, you insulted my wardrobe and offered me a couple of coins to clean the booth just the same.”
Sinews smiled throughout the entirety of Dr. Tidkins' speech. When it was concluded, he replied, “Please forgive me, Dr. Tidkins. My memory increasingly fails me as I grow older. I’m terribly sorry to say that I have no recollection whatsoever of either incident, though I’m sure you have the right of it. That does indeed sound like the old me. I must tell you, however, that my manners have been greatly changed over the last few months. I’m sure you’ll find my manners considerably less—”
“Deplorable?” said Grimmer.
“Condescending,” Sinews suggested, amiably.
“Mr. Sinews has met a woman,” Mrs. Hatton explained.
“Not just any woman, mind you,” Sinews added.
“Love changes a man,” Mrs. Hatton said, “It is love, isn’t it, Parson? I can tell, just by looking at you, that you’ve changed. You’re less—”
“Smug,” Grimmer suggested.
“Sarcastic,” said Mrs. Hatton, “Less insincere.”
“Unfortunately,” Sinews admitted, “Yes. It is love.”
“Unfortunately?” Mrs. Hatton exclaimed. “What is that supposed to mean, exactly?”
The waiter finally arrived. After filling the glass half full with absinthe, he placed a cube of sugar onto the perforated spoon atop the glass and slowly filled the rest of the glass with ice cold water, allowing the sugar to dissolve into the drink as he poured. When he finished, Mr. Steen shouted for him to do the same with his own glass.
“I’m all for romance,” said Mr. Sinews, “It’s love I’m against. Love makes moths of us all. None are safe from its flames.”
“Yes, yes,” Mrs. Hatton murmured, “And we are all bound to get burned. Poppycock. You haven’t lived if you haven’t loved, I say.”
“Whatever your romantic or philosophical inclinations,” said Mr. Sinews, “My point is that love is not a choice. It is a feeling, and one that is impossible to ignore, whether you’d want to or not. At any rate, Dr. Tidkins, to answer your question, my interest is purely recreational. You see, I consider myself a sort of collector.”
“What sort?”
“Much like our friend the detective.” Sinews indicated Mr. Steen, who had already swallowed the best of his newly filled glass of absinthe, and who objected to Sinews’ use of the word ‘friend’ to describe their relationship. “I have a fascination with mysteries, though I have little interest in the literary sort. I prefer true stories. Any mystery will do, so long as it is particularly perplexing, sufficiently bizarre, and above all -”
“Grotesque,” Grimmer finished.
“Quite right,” said Sinews, and he muttered, “Though I wish you would give me leave to finish my own sentences.”
“The world craves the grotesque,” Grimmer said, in perfect imitation of Mr. Sinews’ earlier remarks.
“That’s why we’re here, really,” Sinews said, “All of us. Despite what we might claim. That we wish to vindicate ourselves of accusations of murder; that we are pursuing a quest for vengeance; that we are investigating a story as a journalist; a crime as a consulting detective. The truth of our interests could not be more plain. We share an interest in the morbid, the grotesque, the macabre.”
Mrs. Hatton harrumphed at this suggestion, and Steen righted himself from his slouched position in his chair and launched another verbal tirade against Mr. Sinews. When the speech was concluded, he slumped back into his seat, closed his eyes and appeared to sleep.
“Whatever you say, Parson, I shudder to think that your disposition has been improved by the love of a woman. What sort of man does that imply you must have been previous to the amelioration?”
“You find me cynical, Dr. Tidkins?” Sinews asked.
“Disgustingly so.”
“On the contrary,” Sinews argued, “I am quite optimistic. I have the utmost faith that we will find exactly what we are looking for."
“Death, grotesqueness, and morbidity, you mean?” muttered Tidkins.
“In abundance,” he said.</Text>

The sound of Parson Sinews’ leather shoes on cobblestone was louder than might have been expected from a man who walked with such grace and poise, an effect of reverberation. It was also an effect of perception, an auditory illusion caused by the relative loudness of footsteps against the otherwise still air.
There was a stillness in the air, interrupted only by the dance of shoes on stone, and with that stillness came the sensation that if Parson were to merely pause in his perambulation and to listen, he would hear nothing but the sound of his own blood pulsing through his veins.
Accompanying the rhythm of his steps was the occasionally tap of Parson’s walking stick, an accoutrement carried not as a medical necessity but as the must-have fashionable accessory of the modern London gentleman.
As such, Mr. Sinews did not lean heavily upon the cane but used it to accentuate the rhythm of his gait and to disturb the unnerving quiet as much as possible. Of all the things worth enduring, silence did not rank high on Parson’s list. Not merely in the auditory realm, Parson craved the chaotic and the voluminous. This silence disturbed him.
He quickened his step, increased the force with which he tapped his cane upon the ground, and abandoned the street in favor of a nearby alley.
The alleyway quickly brought him to his fiancé’s residence. He knocked on the door.
It seemed only a moment later that the door swung open. At first, he thought it was Camille. She had the same beautiful brown eyes and caramel-colored skin, her hair pulled into neat cornrows, just like her sister.
“Bonsoir, Rachelle,” he said.
They looked so much alike that Sinews had often gotten them confused, and Rachelle found it amusing to play little jokes on him, planting kisses on his cheeks and calling him sweetheart. He’d learned to recognize their subtle differences since then. The way Camille held her hand on her hip when she was angry, the way she pouted when she was sad, the uninhibited way she laughed. There were physical differences too, but those were less obvious.
“Où est-elle?” he asked. Where is she?
“Suivez-moi,” Rachelle replied. Her French had the same Haitian accent as her sister’s, but her voice was colder than Camille’s.
He stepped through the threshold of the door, and walked into that familiar household with its smells and sounds that brought memories rushing back violently. The smell of coffee beans from the kitchen. The scent of lemon that always seemed to permeate the hallway for whatever reason. The smell of Camille’s perfume from the stairway.
He did as instructed and followed Camille’s twin up a flight of stairs, then down a dimly lit hallway and into the bedroom.
A wave of nausea struck him like a kick to the gut.
There was Camille, standing in the center of the room, dead.
She had a mask sewn to her face made of a jumbled mass of animal and human skin, fur and bone. A pair of dog’s ears replaced her own. Both arms were connected to her shoulders by a system of pistons and winches. The mechanical parts ran straight through her, replacing her skeletal system with machinery. With the grinding of clockwork gears, she raised her arm and waved. The gesture was so delicate, so human, so familiar, that he wanted to gag and choke. He tried to wake up. He was dreaming. He had to be dreaming.
As the grinding of gears continued, she lowered her arm and smiled.
As had been done to her arms, her legs had been altered as well, severed and reattached in the same manner. But it was not merely her own legs that had been sewn back on. She’d gained a few new pairs as well, making her a hideous parody of Arachne. Eight bare legs, each pair different from the other, and each one covered in scars and stitches from thigh to toe. It was clearly the work of the Resurrection Man, Anthony Tidkins.
He wanted to look away, he had to look away. There was nothing in the world he needed quite so much as to avert his eyes, but he could not. He felt sick, but still he found himself drawing closer to this woman that had been Camille.
He drew closer still, until he was standing close enough to touch her. He was near enough to look into her eyes, those eyes that were still hers but which were dead. He laid a hand on her face, as gently as he could.
There was a clicking sound, followed by that same grinding of gears, the whirring of mechanical parts, and the nauseating sound of dead flesh creaking as it moved, reanimated by the automaton beneath her skin.
The sound was tinny and unclear, but the voice was unmistakably hers, and there was pain in her voice. He could hear her voice crack with every tear she fought back as she spoke to him.
“Wake up, Parson,” she said, “it’s just a dream. You need to wake up.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene 21</Title>
            <Text>“You think I’ll make it so easy for you?” Parson Sinews shouted back.
The sleet and fog blurred Jonathan’s vision. He couldn’t be entirely sure what he was seeing, but Sinews was a blur of motion, in one place one moment, in another the next. The policemen opened fire, the gunshots echoing along the empty street, but Sinews was too quick.
Jonathan’s breath escaped him as a policeman flew ten feet into the air and landed hard upon the pavement, unmoving. He hadn’t even seen Sinews hit him, but he must have been hit hard.
Another officer cried out, and a cloud of blood shot out of his neck like perfume from a bottle. His body fell to the gutter, and Sinews practically flew from him to the next man, a blur of motion and surgical precision. More blood hit the gutter. Necks snapped.
Jonathan remembered what Sinews had said about the absinthe: if he thought that absinthe didn’t cause hallucinations, he was drinking the wrong kind of absinthe. Was he hallucinating? Sinews seemed to be everywhere at once, a trail of ghost images where he had been a tenth of a second before.
There were bullets flying, and as fast as Sinews appeared to be, even he couldn’t outpace bullets.
Blood painted the street crimson, and suddenly, there was Parson Sinews again, no longer a blur of motion. Just a crumpled form on the ground, heavily wounded. Drenched in his own blood, Jonathan could hear him laughing, and suddenly he was sure he was hallucinating.
Sinews carried on laughing, even as the remaining policemen cuffed Sinews and carted him off into a black maria. In a few moments, they had rounded up their dead and wounded and were off again.
The street was empty, save for Jonathan and Mr. Ocelot. Stunned into silence by what he’d just witnessed, he wandered out of his hiding place and came to a halt on the sidewalk. Blood ran along the cobbles, the rain washing the streets clean, red lines spreading out like veins. In a matter of moments, the street was washed clean, and any evidence of what had just happened was gone.
“You still think your friend is innocent?” Jonathan asked. His version of events might have been colored by hallucinations, but he was sure that Sinews had indeed been arrested.
Ocelot’s massive shoulders heaved in a sigh, confirming this.
“Believe it or not, Mr. Grimmer,” he said. “Yes. I do still believe Mr. Sinews is innocent in this.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene Six</Title>
            <Text>Once she’d managed to convince Mr. O to sit down and not to touch the liquor cabinet, Miss Monday stepped outside the cabin to speak with the captain.
“How are we looking?” she asked.
The Captain turned his attention away from the steering wheel for a moment to answer her. “Might not make it all the way back to the city,” he said, “But we’ll land this bird no problem.”
She nodded, but she was more relieved than she let on. She’d been afraid the damage would be more than the ship could handle, and that they might be going down in flames.
“We’ll be alright,” said the Captain. “Won’t be easy though. We’ll start by emptying the ballasts.”
“Ballasts?”
The Dreadful had been built with some amount of redundancy in mind, given that it was made for combat. It was heavier than necessary, for example, so that in the event of an emergency, the ballasts could be released, dumping a substantial amount of water to the ground below. All this had been explained to Captain Merrick by Dr. Simms, but he provided Miss Monday with a simplified explanation. “Professor Ashcroft can handle that aspect; I’m not really sure how it works myself,” he said, turning his attention from her to provide the professor with instructions via the speaking tube.
“Not sure that’ll be enough on its own though,” he confessed. “Anything else we can dump?”
“Well, there’s the liquor cabinet,” she suggested.
Captain Merrick looked at her with a bewildered expression on his face. “Don’t be dense,” he said. “How about the cot in the engineering cabin?” he suggested.
She nodded.
“We’re also wasting too much of the ship’s power on her wings,” said the Captain. “But apparently they can also be powered manually. Provides better lift that way too.”
Miss Monday nodded. “Manually?” she echoed.
“I guess Lockwood will have to cover that aspect,” he said, as he explained. Apparently the ship’s wings, relying on the clockwork mechanism for their rotation, were also hooked up to a stationary bicycle, which could provide kinetic power to the wings. “Take a seat and start pedalling,” said Captain Merrick, addressing Lockwood through the speaking tube.
“Right,” said the Captain. “Now we just have to hope for a favourable amount of wind blowing in the right direction.”
Miss Monday thanked him for his time and his expertise, and excused herself to return to the passenger’s cabin, where she found that Mr. O was already dipping into the liquor cabinet despite her warning against the idea.
“So that was your contingency plan? A harpoon gun?”
“Honestly, I didn’t expect that to work. Blind luck though, what can I say. Anyway, that’s why I had two contingency plans, the second of which was a parachute. So,” he said, ignoring her disapproving frown and changing the subject. “What’s the status report?”
“Captain says we’ll be alright with any luck,” she told him, taking a seat.
“Good,” he said. “We haven’t got any time to spare.”
Not that she disagreed, but she looked up at him at that. “What do you mean?” she asked.
“Something I’d better tell you,” he said, drawing a sheet of folded paper out of one of his pockets. He winced, even with the pain-numbing power of intoxication.
“What’s that?” she said. She ought to have been concerned about his pain, but she had done that already and he’d refused her attentions, so she was done playing nursemaid.
“A letter,” he said.
“From whom?”
“I’m no longer certain,” he said. “Supposedly, it’s from Queen Victoria.”
“Supposedly?” she said. She frowned. She didn’t like the sound of that. “I supposed you’d better read it,” she said.
He nodded and unfolded the page.
“My dear Mrs. Grimmer,” he began. “You cannot conceive how happy you have made me, by attending my tea party this Saturday, as I am very fond of pleasant society, and I had been for these last three weeks immured within the old palace, and I longed sadly for some gaiety. However, I must, with your permission, bring your attention to some most distressing news.
While I am sure you will recall that we had recently discussed the unfortunate circumstances under which your Agency came under military scrutiny, I had left you with the assurances that the wisest course of action would be that The Agency remain under the private sector in order to prevent the Unliving threat from becoming public knowledge. However, I have been unable to sway Sir Henry and his men entirely to my point of view.
I have, on the other hand, managed to convince them to at least consider the Agency as a viable alternative to allowing the Unliving to fall under the jurisdiction of the military. Their decision will depend on two factors.
First, if the Agency is to remain in the private sector, it must remain privately funded. I trust that you are able to take care of that minor detail.
Second, while I remain convinced of your Agents’ competence, Sir Henry still requires further convincing.
With that end in mind, he has asked that your Agents complete a test of his own devising. The only requirement of the test will be the extermination of one of your insect specimens, mutated by Lazarus and additionally outfitted with twin mitrailleuses. The Beast may be vanquished in any way that your Agents are able. Sir Henry will supply the specimen, using the sample of the Virus you were able to provide.
I am compelled to ask that your men remain in ignorance of the true nature of this challenge, lest they be otherwise noncommittal; this is another of Sir Henry’s stipulations. As he says, ‘In order to adequately assess The Agency’s competence, their Agents must be fully committed to the endeavour. Otherwise, their likely failure can be explained away as a result of their disinterest.’
I wish the best of luck to you and your Agents with this dreadful mission, should you consent to the challenge.
Your affectionate friend,
Queen Victoria”
Miss Monday listened attentively while he read the letter, then reached out and took the letter from him. She read it through for herself, alternating between glaring at Mr. O and skimming through the letter.
“You complete and utter bastard,” she said. “You let me believe this might be related to our business with Lord Connor’s safe. You nearly got yourself killed. This wasn’t even a real mission.”
She got up out of her seat and fished a cigarette out of her pocket. She pressed it to her lip.
“You can’t smoke in here,” he said.
She shook her head and laughed. She took the cigarette and flicked on the floor. Crushed it beneath her foot.
“I didn’t know you smoked,” he said.
“Only when I’m angry,” she replied. “And since when are you the voice of reason?”
He nodded. “Fair enough,” he said. “You’re angry. You have every right to be. But let me explain.”
“Suck a lemon,” she said. Even for her, it was immature. She regretted it almost immediately.
Be the better woman, she thought. She walked away from him, made her way to the back of the cabin, and found the necessary tools to brew herself a cup of tea. She made just one cup, though she’d offered one to Mr. O earlier and had not made good on that promise. She had no intention of doing so now.
“My Agents have been dying,” said Mr. O. “Not just Lord Connor. Some of the names you’ll have seen on the doors in the basement of the Agency, and more. Men that I have known and loved. Dear friends. They have been dying or going missing. I’m not telling you this in the hopes that it will move you to sympathy, but because aside from Mr. Palmer and myself, there was no one else.”
She sipped her tea and made no answer.
“I truly believed that the very existence of this Agency depended upon the success of this mission. And the success of this mission depended upon your cooperation. Would you have agreed to accompany me if I’d told you the truth?”
Again she drank her tea in silence. She had to admit that no, she wouldn’t. But she made no admission aloud. Just stared back at him with that fierce look in her eyes. What did it matter that the Queen of England had insisted that he lie? What did it matter if she might have refused to help him? He ought to have told her the truth.
“I might not have believed this was a real mission—not at first, anyway -but that didn’t make it any less important,” he said. “What do you suppose would have happened to our pursuit of Dr. Bernhard and the Society of Immortals if the Agency were to be shut down by the monarchy?”
“What did you mean,” she asked finally, “When you said that you’re no longer certain the letter was from the Queen?”
“As I’ve mentioned before and as this letter explains, the Agency and its mission to protect the public against the Unliving threat are sanctioned by the Crown,” he began by way of explanation. “Her Majesty is aware of us and understands the importance of our operation. As do a few key figures in the British military and the London police force. My mother really did attend the Queen’s tea party. And Sir Henry is among those who know of our Agency and its activities. Sir Henry has been rather vocal in his opinion that the Agency’s mission should be taken over by the military. So this might very well have been written by Victoria herself. I had no reason to doubt its authenticity. Not until I saw the Beast in person.”
“What do you mean?” she asked. “It was as the letter said it would be, was it not?”
“The letter suggested that the beast would be outfitted with twin mitrailleuses, which it was. But I rather expected the guns would be attached via a set of straps or perhaps ropes. Something of that sort anyway.”
She nodded. It had been the surgically attached guns that had convinced her of Dr. Tidkins' involvement as well. She was beginning to forget to be angry at Mr. O. When she remembered, she crossed her arms, setting down her cup of tea.
“Furthermore,” he continued, “If I didn’t know better, I’d wager that Beast was once a cockroach. In all of the tests we conducted, cockroaches were among the insects that did not have any reaction to Lazarus.”
She took a moment to consider this. “It does seem like Dr. Tidkins' handiwork,” she admitted, “But how would he have known Mrs. Grimmer had attended Queen Victoria’s tea party?”
Mr. O shook his head. “I’m not sure,” he confessed. “It is possible The Society of Immortals has its fingers in more pies than we realised. I really can’t say for certain. But what I do know is that that beast could not have been created by the Lazarus Virus alone. It was bigger than anything I’ve ever seen. Deadlier. More resilient. More aggressive. The metamorphic properties of Lazarus are impressive, to be sure, but that Beast went well beyond its limitations. And beyond that, there is the technology used in surgically attaching machinery to unliving tissue. Not the sort of thing I would expect from the British Crown. It’s got Tidkins' signature all over it.”
“So, if this thing was sent by the Society of Immortals and not by the monarchy, are we to assume this was another attempt on our lives?”
“No,” said Mr. O. “There are better ways to kill people than this.”
Miss Monday snorted. “That’s what I said when you suggested they were trying to use Connor to kill me,” she said. “Anyway, this time they nearly succeeded.”
“Nearly,” he said with a shrug. “Horseshoes. Hand grenades.”
“So, let me get this straight,” said Miss Monday. “Because I’m not entirely sure I follow your logic. The Society that has already made numerous attempts on our lives send us on a wild goose chase, set a zombie cockroach the size a cathedral on us, outfit it with two machine guns, and leave us for dead…and you don’t think that was an attempt to kill us?”
“Exactly,” said Mr. O. “I mean, I’m sure they would have been pleasantly surprised if the beast had put us down for good. But Dr. Tidkins is familiar with my abilities in the field, as he is with yours. He would have known the Beast would have been nothing more than a distraction,” said Mr. O.
“A distraction,” Miss Monday repeated.
If his hypothesis was correct, what was the Society trying to accomplish while she and Mr. O were otherwise occupied?
“That’s why we can’t afford any further delays. They’ve been killing my agents. And now they’re sending us on false missions. This might not have been an attempt on our lives, but it was certainly an effective way of getting rid of us. We need to get back there, now.”

            <Text>If he’d not been driving expertly before, he certainly took the next few turns with the precision that came from years of experience. He took streets Miss Monday was certain she’d never even seen before. Eventually, he took them down a narrow alleyway that would not allow the passage of the larger carriage which followed them.

[Add more detail]

At last, they’d lost their followers. Miss Monday sat back up in her seat, and willed her heart to resume its regular pace. When her nerves finally began to calm, she opened her picnic basket and peered inside with renewed curiosity.
She wondered if she should not tear open the envelope and look inside before delivering the package to her employers. Had she not earned that right, after what she’d been through? She could seal it again before dropping it off, and they would be none the wiser.
“Hyde Park, miss,” said the driver, interrupting her thoughts.
She opened the little door she’d been pushing coins through, and asked him to drive her to the stables. He responded with a nod, and drove into the park.
A few minutes later, he’d dropped her off at the public stables.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Roderick and Inspector Taggert attempt to fend off the undead aristocrats at Lord Connor’s mansion.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Roderick hated to get blood on his feet, but he put his discomfort aside and stepped forward to put his fingers on the fallen policeman’s neck. He felt for a pulse.
“He seems quite dead,” Roderick announced.
“God!” said Taggert, “Nichols…he was just a boy, really.”
Roderick thought of what the man had said before he died. From downstairs Roderick could hear voices. Inhuman moans, which resonated through the floorboards.
“The dead are waking up,” he repeated the dead policeman’s words. “It seems evident that the dead were not dead at all. Merely unconscious.”
“What?” exclaimed Taggert, not following. “Never mind. What could have done this to him?”
“The recently awoken dead, I’d wager. You said that our witness saw the Resurrectionists spreading poison gas, which seemed to kill its victims in a matter of minutes.”
Taggert nodded. “Seemed to?”
“Unless you believe they are the resurrected dead. No, I think it more likely that those who inhaled the gas did not actually die; they became sick. This sickness caused paralysis, rendered them unconscious, and brought on a death-like state that looked rather convincing.”
He glanced down at the police officer whose neck had been torn out, quickly forming a hypothesis.
“When they woke up, they were no longer themselves. This sickness—whatever it is—seems to cause abnormally aggressive behaviour. Well, it did so in at least one of the afflicted, I should say.”
“Whoever attacked Nichols, you mean?” Taggert asked.
Roderick nodded.
“Let us assume for now that this condition affects everyone equally, however, and shut the door,” he said, looking at the wounds in Taggert’s neck with worry. “If my assumption is correct, we may be in imminent danger.”
Roderick could hear footsteps now, amidst the sound of moaning voices. The sounds gradually drew closer, up the stairs. Roderick could smell the rotten stench of this sickness, growing stronger as the sick approached.
“Quickly now. A barricade!” Roderick shouted, spurring the policemen into action.
As the door had been kicked in and it had not yet been repaired, it would not shut properly. Furthermore, it had no lock. The best they could do was to build a makeshift blockade, by dragging furniture into the doorway. They had to move the fallen officer’s body out of the way. Some of the officers had fallen into a stunned silence; evidently the death of the officer was shocking. As for Roderick, he could hardly care less. There was a much more pressing concern.
Already, the sick were banging on the door, even as Roderick and the detectives slid the furniture into the doorway. The infected were surprisingly strong, given their condition, and Roderick feared the door would not hold.
“What now?” asked Roderick.
Taggert looked at him with astonishment.
“You tell me!” he exclaimed. “You’re the genius, aren’t you?”
Roderick’s eyes went wide.
“I’m an artist!” he cried. “You’re a policeman.”
Taggert didn’t argue. Neither did he offer a suggestion of their next move, but continued to look to Roderick.
“I may be educated, observant, and incredibly well dressed, but that hardly means I’m the one to turn to in a crisis!” He swallowed. “Then again, being pragmatic, better to trust myself to get us out of this than you lot.”
Taggert snorted. For a moment, he looked like he was forming a retort, but apparently he thought better of it.
“Ammunition,” Roderick said, suddenly energized as he assessed the situation aloud. “How much do we have between us?”
“Ammunition?”
“What do you do with rabid dogs, Mr. Taggert?”
“Put them down,” Taggert replied, stammering, “But these aren’t dogs.”
The door rattled fiercely, drowning out Roderick’s reply. The wood began to splinter as the sick began to pry apart the door, seizing hold of its weak point where it had already been kicked in. The makeshift barricade began to shake as the door banged against it.
Roderick bent down next to the fallen policeman and began to loot through his pockets.
“What are you doing?” said the officer with the distinctive moustache.
Roderick withdrew a revolver and a fistful of bullets. He loaded the chamber as reply. The officer nodded. At least, thought Roderick, one pragmatist amongst them.
“They might as well be dogs,” said Roderick. “They tore open the throat of your fellow officer, and I imagine they’ll do the same to you given half the chance. We don’t know what sickness afflicts them, or if a cure exists, but I’m afraid we won’t have a chance to find out if we don’t defend ourselves.”
Taggert had been edging closer to the door, trying to peer through the cracks and to see what loomed on the other side. He jumped back suddenly.
“This door won’t hold,” he said.
“No,” said Roderick. “Be ready. When the door comes crashing down, you mustn’t hesitate.”
“Roderick!” Taggert exclaimed, interrupting him.
Roderick whirled around. Nichols, the wounded officer, had already awoken. The sickness had taken him, and he was inches from Roderick, his mouth open, moaning hungrily. Already, he seemed transformed by the sickness, no longer human, stinking like something rotten, moving with a clumsy, lumbering gait.
Roderick stumbled back.
“Shoot him!” he cried.
The officers hesitated to shoot one of their own.
“For god’s sake!” Roderick shouted, drawing his own weapon, and firing it at him.
Nichols stumbled backward, then a moment later, regained his stride. Roderick shot him again, twice, in the chest. Nichols’ step faltered with the impact of the bullets. But only for a moment. Then he resumed his pace, staggering towards Roderick as if the bullets through his heart were no more irritating than the buzzing of a fly.</Text>

            <Notes>He fished a bit of cocaine out of his pockets, taking some for himself and offering some to the policemen.
"Cocaine, Roderick?" Taggert exclaimed, "Really?"
"I find it helps with the nerves," Roderick said, taking a breath. He shrugged. Taggert raised an eyebrow, but eventually declined the offer. "Your loss."
The officer with the moustache look looked like he might accept, but Taggert warned him off with a steely glare.</Notes>

            <Text>“Allow me to explain,” said Mr. Sinews, taking yet another sip of absinthe, “And please forgive me if I dredge up details with which you are already familiar. This will all go more smoothly if I make the assumption of your ignorance.
“The truth of the doctor’s origins are widely disputed. As Grimmer can surely tell you, most newspapers would have you believe that he was initially hired as a military scientist, charged with the responsibility of creating war-winning soldiers whose very bodies and minds were both chemically and surgically altered. This operation was crown-sanctioned but under the direction of the doctor, quickly got out of hand. The doctor was relieved of his position and was sentenced to be tried for his crimes. There are certain discrepancies among every report you’ll read, but the truth, as far as I can surmise, is that Doctor George Allen was merely the scapegoat for an operation which went exactly as planned.”
Mrs. Hatton objected loudly, and Steen suggested that Parson be hanged for treason for the suggestion. Sinews ignored them both and continued.
“A penny dreadful by the name of The Horrors of Allen’s Street, claims that the doctor was rejected from the gates of hell and sent back to practice experimental surgical procedures on unwilling participants.
“What the newspapers, the urban legends, and the penny dreadfuls always agree upon is the result of his experiments. His subjects – victims, if you will – were displayed publicly, like trophies, at various landmark locations, laid out at night and left to be discovered the next morning. The fact of their public exhibition is of course the exception to my hypothesis, that everything went according to plan. Why Allen felt the need to display his experiments publicly is a matter of speculation. One theory, and the one to which I had until recently subscribed, suggests that Dr. Allen was nothing more than a pawn in a grand scheme, his experimentation went against his principles, and he felt compelled to expose his manipulators, divulge himself of his hideous secrets and atone for his heinous sins.
“However, I have come up with another theory. As I said, Dr. Allen was tasked with creating an army of superior soldiers, using both surgical and pharmaceutical technologies. When I began my research into Dr. Allen’s activities, I stumbled across a subject that at first seemed to bear no relevance to the case, but which upon further consideration I realized was absolutely critical in understanding Dr. Allen’s motives.
“Mr. Ocelot, are you familiar with the term houngan?”
“Yes,” said Ocelot, “A houngan is a sorceror, a practitioner of dark magic.”
“Hm,” said Mr. Sinews, “I have heard it said that occasionally science is indistinguishable from magic.”
“You’re saying…?”
“The story I read about a particular houngan, living in Haiti, apparently involved bringing a man back from the dead. However, when the man returned to life he was subject to the whims of the sorceror—forced to do his bidding. The resurrected man, according to the man who penned this particularly interesting article, was not under a vodou spell, but had been poisoned with a particularly potent powder: a concoction involving the neurotoxins of a pufferfish, which can induce a death-like state convincing enough to fool even the most scrutinous of doctors. The other ingredients in that powder were behaviour-altering drugs. Pharmaceutical powders which could induce susceptibility to suggestion, cause delirium and cause memories to vanish from the victim’s mind.
“After reading the article, I wondered, perhaps this was the sort of thing Dr. Allen had been experimenting with. Would not a zombie make a perfect soldier? A man with no memories and no free will of his own, a soldier who would blindly follow the orders of his general?
“I hypothesized that not only had Dr. Allen concocted such a drug, but that it, or something like it, had been used on the doctor himself. After refusing to continue with his heinous experimentations, he was slipped enough of the drugs to cause compliance. However, his behaviour was also altered. He became something quite unlike his former self. Something inhuman. He began to conduct his experiments again with renewed interest and enthusiasm, even going so far as to display his accomplishments proudly and publicly.
“At any rate, whatever his reasons were, his subjects were most grotesquely vivisected and given all sorts of unusual prosthetics. Limbs would be severed from the bodies and surgically reattached using a highly sophisticated system of brass and copper mechanisms: cogs and gears, levers and pulleys. Often, even the patient’s head would be detached and later reassembled with pistons and springs in place of a neck. The face would be surgically altered as well, sometimes with animal bones and parts sewn on to the victim’s face; the dreadful’s horrific climax depicts one occasion during which the beak of a falcon was sewn over the victim’s mouth and a pair of clocks was lodged in the sockets of the victim’s eyes.
“In each case, huge sections of skin would be stripped to reveal in place of human organs a complex machine. At the slightest provocation – a light touch, or even the stirring of the breeze caused by a curious passerby’s proximity – there would be a whirring of gears as the clockwork abomination came to life.
“The victim, dead and smelling of formalin, would open his mouth or in some cases beak and play back a message, using the technology of Thomas Edison’s phonograph.
“The message would be recorded onto a wax cylinder, its crank turned by clockwork machinery, the phonograph’s horn hidden within the subject’s flesh. Using a system of winches and pistons, the automaton’s mouth would be animated like a puppet, choreographed to move synchronously with the recorded message. The impression, of course, is that the victim has come back to life to deliver a message from beyond the grave.
“According to legend, the messages are clues; each message has been transcribed in the police records kept at Scotland Yard. The writer of the Penny Dreadful to which I alluded earlier was somewhat inventive as to the contents of the messages and suggested they were musings of the demonic leader of a satanic cult.
“In truth, the messages led the police to the discovery of the killer’s identity, that of Dr. Allen. Unfortunately, they also discovered that Dr. Allen was a pseudonym, that the original documentations and qualifications provided to the army upon hiring him for his scientific expertise were entirely falsified, including but not limited to the doctor’s actual address. He had provided his own age and name as his address – 44 Allen’s Street. To add further insult, it was soon discovered that Allen’s Street did not appear on any map; officially, Allen’s Street did not exist.”
“And yet, here we are,” said Mr. Tidkins.
“On a street that doesn’t exist,” said Mr. Sinews, “Yes. Some say the story is merely a folk tale, concocted by mothers hoping to dissuade their children from wandering down unknown streets. ‘Careful,’ they say, ‘Wander off, and you may end up on Allen’s Street.’
“As you know, Doctor Allen has yet to be found. And many of the details of the story may be embellished if not entirely fabricated. And yet a great number of points are entirely verifiable facts. At the very least, we now know that his street does indeed exist.”
“A chilling story, Mr. Sinews,” said Mrs. Hatton, “Absolutely chilling. You have such a way with words. You ought to be a writer.”
“Alas,” said Mr. Sinews, “If only I had the imagination.”
Mrs. Hatton laughed, but Sinews remained stoic. As the hour was growing late, it was decided that the group would convene again at a later date. For the moment, they began to collect their umbrellas and their coats and say their goodbyes.
Mr. O lingered a while longer, in order to have a brief word with the hostesses.</Text>

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>Throughout the entirety of the first meeting of the Vigilance Committee, their hosts had remained elusive, swooping in and out of the shadows with a cup of tea with barely a word spoken and hoods drawn up over their faces. On the other hand, it was possible that Jonathan had simply failed to notice them, as he routinely did with the domestic staff. This time, by contrast, he noticed them straight away. It was difficult not to, given that the Tea House was otherwise empty.
The hostesses, a trio of robed women, bickering and gossiping amongst themselves as Jonathan and his crew entered the tea house, had the appearance of sisters. Each had the voice of someone whose lungs had been subjected to a lifetime’s worth of cigarettes, but they chattered amongst themselves excitedly like children. At last they noticed that Jonathan and his entourage had entered the Tea House, at which point they quieted and offered up an empty table. After taking their orders for tea, they disappeared, leaving Jonathan, Miss Monday, the Professor and the Captain, as well as Mr. Lockwood and Mr. Palmer, to their own devices.
They centred themselves around a long wooden table, leaving several seats open for their expected guests. Jonathan kept a wary eye on their hosts while they worked. He sensed that there was something unusual about them, a mystery to them as deep as that surrounding the Resurrectionists. Then again, the mysterious aspect that surrounded them might very well have been affected, given that the sisters also maintained a business of reading fortunes. At any rate, Jonathan had more than enough on his mind as it was, without worrying about them. He wondered, though, if they should have chosen a different, more private venue in which to discuss things.
He turned to Mr. Palmer.
“I’ve been wondering,” he said. “If the Lazarus Virus is airborne, how do the Resurrectionists intend to protect themselves from infection?”
By way of answer, Abraham held up his mask. He passed it to Jonathan, who turned it over in his hands. Inside the beak-like protrusion of the mask was a rubber seal. A network of tubes, a filter. The plague mask was not merely symbolic of the Resurrectionist connection to crows, it was also a means of avoiding the plague.
“A gas mask,” said Jonathan, handing it back.
Abraham nodded. “Why do you think I held on to it?”
“So, what is it with the Resurrectionists and crows?” asked Miss Monday.
Abraham shrugged. “Certain animals possess a natural immunity to the virus. Carrion birds, for example.”
Just then, the door swung open with a jingling of bells. A middle-aged woman swept into the room. The gentlemen stood up.
“Mrs. Hatton,” said Jonathan. He introduced her to the rest, and invited her to join them at the table.
“How do you do, Mr. Grimmer?” she said.
Jonathan winced. “Mr. O, if you please,” he said, gesturing meaningfully at the Moirae. “Best to stick with our assumed names, lest we be overheard, don’t you think?” 
“That reminds me,” said Miss Monday. “Where does your pseudonym come from?”
“My middle name is Oliver,” he said.
She smiled, showing her dimples at him. He frowned, feeling as though she was having a laugh at his expense. He returned his attention to Mrs. Hatton, who he knew only from their brief introduction at the previous meeting of the Vigilance Committee. He really didn’t know what to make of her interest in Dr. Allen.
It was not long before the now-familiar sound of the bells announced the entrance of Edward Steen and Henry Charles Ocelot, who joined them at the table, after another round of introductions. Finally, the small talk drawn to a halt, as Mrs. Grimmer stepped into the little Tea House.
“What is she doing here?” Miss Monday demanded. She was on her feet in an instant, staring daggers at Jonathan’s mother.
Mrs. Grimmer looked at Abraham Palmer.
“You didn’t mention I’d be joining you?” she asked.
Palmer shrugged. “If I had, I don’t think she’d still be here.”
Jonathan had to agree. He wasn’t entirely sure even he would still be here. Mrs. Grimmer was still his mother, sure, but she had a long way to go towards regaining his trust, if that was ever something he had with her. Nurturing, warm, maternal, not words that described Mrs. Grimmer, and Jonathan’s relationship with her was not close. Even to say that she’d raised him was a stretch. Jonathan had been raised by servants, really. Honestly, he wouldn’t have put it past her to have sided with the Resurrectionists, so long as there was money involved in the proposition. He regarded her cautiously.
She wore a scowl on her face, her most constant expression. She turned to Jonathan, attempting to soften the expression into what she must have thought was a smile.
“Son,” she said.
“Don’t you son me,” Jonathan retorted.
“Very well,” she said, abandoning her attempted facial expression in favour of the tried and true scowl. She took a seat at the table, and Mr. Steen shuffled his chair away from her. “Let’s skip the small talk.”</Text>

            <Text>When he finally released her from his iron grasp, she took the opportunity to try again with the umbrella, swinging it with all the violence of a cornered animal.
But to her dismay, he quickly brought his cane up to defend himself with the deft movements of a man trained in cannes de combat or bartitsu.
Whichever his martial art of choice, Miss Monday forced herself to be relentless. If she could shatter this first man’s skull with her umbrella, she might have a chance to fish her revolver out of her vest in order to escape the other man. She lashed out again with her umbrella, aiming this time for the man’s gut. He parried her thrust, but only just.
Moving in, she swung again, striking at his feet. Quickly, he shifted his feet, avoiding her blow, but he stumbled over a fallen branch that lay upon the ground. She seized the opportunity, kicking at him with a hard-soled boot that caught him in the gut.
He keeled over, his top hat slipped from his head, so she grasped her umbrella with both hands and struck him with full force on the cranium.
He crumpled hard to the ground.
She was about to strike him again, triumphant though she was. She didn’t wish to give him the opportunity to recover himself and gain the advantage, especially given that she expected his accomplice to come to his aid momentarily. But he rolled onto his back, raising his hands to defend himself, and cried out in protest.
“Stop! Stop!” he cried. His voice was familiar.
His face too, she recognised, now that she had the opportunity to look at it.
“Mister O?” she said, startled.
She whirled around, casting about for the other man who’d been chasing her. Apparently, the thug had vanished during her fight with Mr. O.
“Good afternoon, Miss Monday,” he said, clutching his wounded head and groaning.
She let out a growl of frustration. Then she sighed, as she realised she’d better help him up. She extended a hand to him, which he declined.
“I’m fine,” he insisted, slowly getting back on his feet. “I’m not bleeding, am I?”
“I’m afraid you are,” she said, looking with only mild embarrassment at the bloody gash on the crown of his head. She ought to apoligise. But then again, he was the one who’d been stalking her all afternoon, wasn’t he? And he must have hired that thug who’d nearly frightened her to death.
What was he expecting to happen when he was stalking a woman he knew to be dangerous? Truly, he only had himself to blame.
“What is the meaning of this?” she demanded.
“I’ve been hoping to speak with you,” he said, rubbing the wound on his head and complaining like a child with a bruise. “You know, that really hurts,” he said.
“Serves you right,” said Miss Monday.
“Hmph,” said Mr. O, by way of reply.
“Well, I’ve had quite enough of your behaviour,” she said, talking to him as if she were scolding a small child, “It’s gone on long enough.”
“Whatever are you talking about?” he asked.
“Pursuing me all morning across the streets of London? Hiring thugs to capture me?” she said, withdrawing her pistol and aiming it at him. “What is it that you want from me? Spit it out, then kindly get back into your carriage and leave me to my business.”
Mr. O shook his head. “You are quite mistaken, Miss Monday,” he said, “You see, I travelled here by airship.”
He gestured above their heads, and Miss Monday spared a glance at the sky. There was the same airship he’d shown her at Lord Connor’s, floating above their heads.
Miss Monday looked at the airship, then back at Mr. O again. “You mean…” she said, frowning severely, “You mean to say that you were not stalking me this morning?”
“I’m sorry to disappoint you,” he said, tipping his hat in an ironically gentlemanly gesture.
Miss Monday lowered her weapon. “What game are you playing, sir? If you haven’t been following me, then who has been? That enormous thug who was chasing me? If not one of your thugs, then who was he?”
“I did warn you that your life was in danger,” he replied with one of his customary shrugs that had come to aggravate Miss Monday to the utmost degree.
“And if you did not follow me here,” she said, “Am I expected to believe that it is coincidence that led us both to Hyde Park Stables this morning?”
“You’d have to be a fool to believe that,” he said. “No, I found you here because, as I said when we first met, my business is information. I expected you would come here, and I was right. This is where you meet your clients, is it not?”
She narrowed her eye at him and looked straight into his face as if to deduce whether or not he was telling the truth.
“Well,” she said after a long, drawn-out sigh that seemed to indicate her willingness to hear him out in spite of her better judgment, “Now that you’ve found me, what is it that you wanted to tell me?”</Text>

            <Title>Scene Two</Title>
            <Text>To Jonathan it seemed as if everything had started with the letters in his father’s drawers. Were it not for those letters, he would never have attended Lord Connor’s party, never met his assassin Mr. Monday, never ventured to attended Mr. Sinews’ Vigilance Committee meeting, never witnessed his arrest. One thing led to another, but Jonathan had come full circle. Out of leads, he had returned to his father’s office to see what else might turn up.
Truthfully, it had begun with his father’s death. If his father were still alive, he’d never have turned up the letters. But Jonathan still wanted to avoid thinking about his father’s death. Instead, he pried through the old man’s belongings, picked through his office until his eyes hurt and eventually fell shut.
He slumped in the old Mr. Grimmer’s chair and awoke with drool on his face. He wiped his chin on his sleeve and sat upright, shaking his head as if to rouse himself.
The almost-musical clang of the printing press resonated down the hall to his office, signalling that the day’s operations had already begun. Connor’s letters were sitting on the desk. He’d been up so late, he couldn’t recollect having taken them from his coat pocket, but he must have been reading them again, searching for something he’d missed.
But there was nothing. For however many times he’d studied each and every syllable, there was nothing new to be gleaned, from the letters or from the contents of this desk.
Then again…
He was reaching to open the desk drawer again, clumsy from having just woken up, and had banged his arm on something that shouldn’t have been there. He got out of his seat and knelt down to see what it was. A lever. He reached beneath the desk, took hold of it, and pulled. There was a ratcheting sound and a distant boom as the room began to reveal his father’s secrets.
Jonathan’s mouth fell open. Along the edge of the red carpet, there was a circular groove notched into the hardwood floor. It began to twist open. A section of the floor began slowly to rise up with the heavy sound of wood grinding against wood.
Jonathan got out of his seat to get a better look at what was happening, and peered into the gap in the floor as the single circular section of the floor continued to rise. He caught flashes of steel and brass, turning cogs and winding pulleys.
“What on god’s green earth?” he muttered.
He could hear the sound, loud even against the din of the printing press from down the hall, of enormous gears turning from somewhere well below. It was almost like the sound of a clock tower, or the turning wheels of a locomotive. The mechanical clang of an enormous machine coming to life.
“A secret elevator,” he realised, as it rose up to fill the the gap in the floor.</Text>

            <Title>it had felt so real. He’d looked into her eyes. He’d</Title>
            <Text>Parson Sinews woke up violently, sitting up abruptly and gasping for air as if he hadn’t been breathing. He sat there panting for a moment, sweating as he caught his breath. “It felt so real,” he said, trembling. “It felt so real.”
He’d looked into Camille’s eyes. He’d heard her voice, seen her lips moving, smelt her perfume. But Camille wasn’t dead. She was alive and well, and she had dragged him to this hell hole.
“Resurrectionist bitch,” he muttered.
“Are you awake?” said a voice.
He turned toward the sound. His head ached. He knew he’d been drugged, but he tried to fight off the effects, blinking rapidly to maintain focus. Most of the past few—what? Hours? Days?—had passed by in a fog. He could scarcely remember where he was, let alone how he’d gotten there.
It was a prison cell, with iron bars as walls, a thin slot in the door for food to be slid through. His bed was a slab of wood barely enough to accommodate his height, with a mattress thin enough he swore he could feel the splinters in the wood beneath it. He had no pillow to speak of, but he did have blankets, and he’d folded them up into a pile and used them as one. No wonder he was so cold. He had the vague memory of being locked in a cell in the Resurrectionists’ lab, but he knew this wasn’t the same cell. He was somewhere else.
The cell beside him was too dimly lit to make out the shadowy figure from within, but he could see that there was someone in there.
“Who’s there?” he said.
“Ah,” said the voice, as the shadow moved toward him, “You are awake. You know, you talk in your sleep. Makes it difficult to tell if you’re awake or not.”
Finally, the man’s face appeared between the bars, and Mr. Sinews could make out his features. He was old, but he’d been able to determine that from the quality of his voice, so the wrinkled visage and the purplish bags beneath his eyes were not unexpected. He had a gentle disposition, if the look of a man could give any such indication. There was a kindness in his eyes, and the hint of a smile on his face, which struck Parson as sincere.
What sort of prison was this?
“Parson Sinews,” he said.
“Ah,” said the old man, broadening his smile, “Isn’t that interesting? A parson and a priest, side by side. Father Pieres, at your service. Though the guards seem to know me as ‘The Mad Priest.’ A little joke they have.”
Parson laughed bitterly. “I suppose that makes me Edmond—” He stopped suddenly. “This is Chateau d’If,” he said, “That’s where I am, isn’t it? They said they were going to take me here.”
The priest nodded.
“How did you end up here?” Parson asked.
Pieres shrugged. “Saw something they didn’t want me to see.”
“Who didn’t want you to see?”
“Ah,” said the priest, “Isn’t that obvious?”
“Resurrectionists,” Parson muttered. He got out of bed and stretched his neck as he moved toward the iron bars that separated their cells. The floor swayed beneath his feet as if he was at sea. Perhaps he shouldn’t have stood so quickly.
“What sort of prison is this?” he asked.
“Ah,” said Pieres, scratching his beard as he talked, “It’s a very special kind of prison is what it is. You and I have both seen things we weren’t meant to see. That knowledge makes us dangerous to them. They send us here so we don’t interfere with their agendas.”
“And why not just kill us?” he asked. “They’re obviously not above killing.”
“I like to think they haven’t killed me because I’m more valuable to them alive.”
Parson snorted. “Somehow I don’t find that thought altogether comforting.”
He thought about Camille. He had fallen for her charms, fallen head over heals into a love that was inescapable, bordering on obsessive. Even now, the thought of her made him weak. He wondered if there had ever been a moment where she’d sincerely loved him back, or if she’d been plotting against him all this time. She must have loved him. It was the only thing that explained why he was still alive. If this was a Resurrectionist prison, he could only assume that Camille had used her influence to have him sent here instead of letting him be killed. Sentiment was her weakness, just as it had been his. She should have just killed him.
When he got out of this cell, he would abandon whatever feelings he still had for Camille and replace them with vengeance. There would be no mercy for her.</Text>

            <Title>Scene Three</Title>
            <Text>When all but Parson Sinews had departed, they emerged from the darkest corner of the room.
“Did you find everything to your satisfaction?” asked Atropos, her voice painfully harsh and raspy, like the voice of a sick person.
Dressed in old-fashioned dark, billowing robes with a hood that obscured most of her age-wizened face, Atropos was almost nun-like in appearance. It was difficult to get a good look at her face, the way she positioned herself as if deliberately avoiding the light.
“Of course he did,” said Lachesis, not giving Sinews the chance to answer for himself. “We’ve plied him with alcohol, and waited on his friends hand and foot.”
Like Atropos, Lachesis seemed to dwell in the darkest parts of the room. Turning away from him momentarily, she began to dim the oil lamps and blow out the candles that lit the room. She too was dressed in robes, though hers were white. Her face, when he caught a glimpse of it, was wrinkled with age as well, though not as severely as was her sister’s. Likewise, her voice was grating and sickly, but not to the degree of Atropos’.
“Let the man answer for himself,” said Clotho. “How was everything, Parson? Did ya have a good time? Not really the best of company, eh? That Ocelot guy. Gives me the heebie jeebies.”
Clotho, who was dressed more similarly to Lachesis, in white robes, likewise avoided the light parts of the room, and covered her face with her hood, but when Sinews did catch a glimpse of her face, it did not seem at all altered by the effects of time. Her voice, unlike that of her sisters, was melodious and clear and almost jubilant by contrast with the sombre tone of Atropos and the middle tone of Lachesis.
“Thank you,” he said, addressing the eldest sister by way of respect, “We do appreciate you keeping your shop open to us after hours. Everything has been perfect.”
“Then why do you linger?” asked Atropos. “Your friends are gone. You have nothing about which to complain. There must be something else that you want.”
“Oh, you don’t think he just fancies our company?” said Clotho.
“You are very astute,” said Mr. Sinews. His usually cool demeanour, his sardonic smile, faltered in the presence of the three sisters. All of his useless aphorisms, honesty is a dreadful thing, love makes moths of us all. It suddenly seemed like foolish nonsense. Suddenly he questioned his foolhardy mission. Capturing the nefarious Dr. Allen, was he serious? The others, they all had their reasons, but Sinews, he was just a rich man with a fascination with the macabre. All of his ridiculous expostulations on the identity of the killer, it was just showboating, wasn’t it? It was his overbearing egotism, his arrogance, hubris even.
Suddenly he realised that he’d been looking into the eyes of Atropos. Without his noticing, she’d removed her hood. She’d held his gaze without blinking. He quickly looked away.
“It’s just…” he began. “Can I really do what I’ve promised? Can I really track down this Dr. Allen? To be entirely honest, I haven’t the slightest idea of where to begin.”
“That’s not really what you’re asking though, is it?” said Atropos.
“I suppose not,” said Mr. Sinews, “Can you tell me—”
“No,” said Atropos.
“No?”
“The answer to your question,” said Atropos, her voice as cold as a metal pole on a winter’s day, “Is no.”
“Oh, let him ask it,” said Lachesis.
“Ask, ask,” said Clotho, “We’ll tell you.”
She indicated her sister, Lachesis, when she said this, excluding the eldest from the arrangement. There came, as she spoke, a hissing noise from beneath Lachesis’ robes.
“Quiet,” she said.
Mr. Sinews looked down, toward the source of the noise, but seeing nothing, returned his attention to Atropos, even though she’d already answered the question he had yet to ask.
“If you can truly see what fate has in store for me,” he said, “If you can see my future, why can’t you tell me?”
“You want to know how you die?” asked Clotho, suddenly excited.
“Would you care to know the manner of your demise?” Lachesis echoed. The hissing came again from her robes. “Alice, Dorothy, be quiet,” she urged.
“No,” said Atropos.
Clotho frowned. Lachesis merely shrugged.
“It’s not so simple as telling,” said Atropos, “No man should know his fate, and knowing it won’t change it. The adventure is in living.”
“That’s true,” Lachesis conceded.
“But it isn’t,” said Clotho, turning so that Parson could see just a bit more of her face. She was smiling, he could see that much. And there was something crawling on her skin. A spider, he thought. “We should tell him. He so badly wants to know.”
Alice and Dorothy hissed in agreement.
“Shh.”
“No,” said Atropos.
“At least,” Clotho persisted, “Let us read for him.”
“Palms?” asked Lachesis.
“Bones,” suggested Atropos.
“Tarot,” Clotho replied, almost shouting in her excitement, “Tarot is so much more in keeping with the times.”
“That’s true,” said Lachesis.
“Fine,” said Atropos, “We’ll read your cards, Sinews, but that’s as far as we’ll go.”
“Well,” said Clotho, as if to suggest that they would go further.
“What now?” Atropos demanded.
“We should give him the recipe,” she said.
Alice and Dorothy hissed. A spider crawled on Clotho’s hand. Sinews was certain it was a spider now. He could see it spin its web and dangle from her robed hand, lowering itself toward the floor.
“Which recipe?” he asked, following as Atropos let the way to a dark corner of the room. A small table with four chairs stood against a curtained window. An oil lamp hung above the table, its flame all but extinguished. He sat down even as Atropos drew a deck of cards from within some hidden pocket in her robes.
“Which recipe?” Lachesis echoed, taking a seat across from Sinews.
“The one with the blood,” said Clotho, choosing the seat to the left of her sister and the right of Mr. Sinews.
“Be more specific,” said Atropos. She sat down to the right of Lachesis, directly across from Clotho.
“Absinthe,” Clotho hinted.
“No,” said Atropos.
“But,” said Clotho, “Origins are my domain.”
“Yes,” said Lachesis, “That’s true. The past tense is Clotho’s.”
“We won’t show him how they die,” she promised.
Atropos growled. “Let me think about it,” said Atropos. “But first, the cards.”

            <Title>Scene</Title>
            <Text>A few minutes later, the horse let out a huff of exertion as it cantered up a winding, gravel driveway. The entrance to the driveway was marked by a wooden sign, which hung smartly from a tall signpost, set between two tall statues of horses. Grimmer and Sons Printing Company, the sign read in a plain font carved into the wood.
Annabel had chosen to follow her hunch. She knew that the Grimmer company owned several newspapers, as well as a number of imprints for penny bloods, society papers, and magazines, a number of which had their own offices. This was the company’s head office, and it was here, she suspected, that she would be most likely to find Mr. O.
She thought of what he’d been wearing at Connor’s ball—a well-tailored suit in the latest fashion. She considered his manners, and the fact that he had received an invitation to Connor’s ball in the first place. She thought of his airship. That he had been entrusted with the company airship suggested he held one of the top positions at the company. He was someone important, then. In all likelihood, therefore, he worked at the head office. It was possible he was one of the heads of the newspapers, which would mean that he probably worked at one of the smaller offices. But she figured this was still the best place to start looking.
She hopped out of the hansom, paid the driver, and sauntered up the driveway. The Grimmer Company building was a broad, stern-looking building, all geometric lines and rigid, unshakeable brick. A broad staircase of white marble led to the front door. Annabel noticed a couple of tall, rectangular windows, which looked out onto the wide courtyard. She could see the printing company's employees working at typewriters and hauling stacks of books and newspapers through the windows. She wondered if she might spot Mr. O just by looking through the window.
She straightened out her dress, feeling suddenly self-conscious, having worn one of her best dresses for the visit. Annabel had a number of aliases aside from Miss Monday—including, of course, Mr. Monday—but she'd chosen to stick with her usual persona for this occasion. It would be odd for a woman of a lower class than Mr. O to inquire after him, but for the well-to-do Miss Monday, it should be somewhat acceptable. She should have a chaperone, but Annabel wasn't terribly concerned about gossip.
She climbed the stairs and let herself in the front door.</Text>

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>He awoke late in the afternoon to a cacophony of crows cawing. He had slept in the attic, as he had been doing for the past few nights and would do for a few days more. Until the plan had been brought to fruition, it was too risky to stay overnight in his own home or even at the laboratory. This was the safest place for him now. His sleep had been almost catatonic. Last night when he’d laid down in bed, he had fallen into an instant slumber. And when he awoke, it was with vigour and excitement. With a rush of manic energy.
The sound of crows filled him with a deep joy that could not easily be explained. The sound might have been perceived as shrill and bothersome by another man, the birds seen as pests. But to him, the birds were miraculous. Crows, he’d always believed, were surprisingly intelligent, and though they were scavengers they were every bit as majestic as any bird of prey. So the sound of their voices did not bother him. They roused him.
He climbed out of bed, craving the chance to repeat yesterday night’s activities. The girl in the flower dress. If he could just bring her back, he could kill her all over again. Watch the life leave her cheeks. Smell the sour miasma of rot begin to overtake her. Feel her skin turn cold and pale and dry. See her limbs become stiff, her eyes turn white.
Death, he thought. Death is the cure for life.
And he was the doctor, administering the prescription. He would do it again. He needed to. But not now. Now, he needed to focus. There was still work to be done.
He descended the staircase and heard the voices of the others. They had gathered in the café for tea and biscuits while he slept through the day, sweet dreams filling his head. Their chatter was animated, but it hushed to a whisper as he descended.
He felt all eyes upon him as he entered the parlour. Only gentlemen present, excepting their hosts.
There was a man on the table. Dead. Not unliving, but dead. He could tell at a glance that the man would transition shortly, but he was strapped down, so there was little cause for concern. The gentlemen were drinking tea, not paying the dead man any heed.
“Who is he?” he asked.
One of the gentlemen looked at a sheet of paper to be sure. “Rémy Mills, maybe? One of Mr. O’s men anyway. One of the last. How did it go?”
He nodded. Yes. He’d done it. He’d killed someone.
“Yes,” he said. “It went well. Very well.”
He didn’t have to kill. They had others amongst them whose skills and interests were perhaps better suited for the task. And thugs were a dime a dozen. That wasn’t why they’d tasked him with the murder.
They wanted to know that his conscience could handle it. That he would not back down when the time came. They were going to unleash the plague on London. If he couldn’t handle a simple murder, how could he handle that? And they couldn’t afford to have anyone back down. As Lord Connor had.
He could sympathize. He hadn’t been sure he would be capable of it either. In fact, he’d been sure he would fail. It had gone better than expected. Much better. Not only had he done it; he’d revelled in it. But he kept that part to himself.
“Good,” they said. “Well done, Anthony.”
He smiled. It felt good. The plan was coming together. Every day now fewer and fewer obstacles stood in their way.
“What happened on the Thames?” he asked.
They were about to answer, but there was a knock at the door. The door opened and a man hurried through it. A giant of a man, with a rough face and dull, unintelligent eyes. Not cleanly shaven, not in the least handsome. The scars of a fighter marked his face.
He was dragging another man behind him. He shoved the man into the café so that he stumbled into the crowd of gentlemen who were drinking their tea and chatting civilly.
“Help me,” he cried when he saw them. “Please, this ruffian—” He broke off when he saw the body lying on the table. “Rémy,” he said quietly.
“Ah, that settles that then. We weren’t quite certain of his identity.” The gentleman checked the list again. “That must make you…” He ran his finger down the page. “Bartholomew White.”
He didn’t answer. Just stared at them, open-mouthed, as the giant closed the door. “What is wrong with you people?”
Anthony smiled at him, but he kept his silence. He turned his attention from Mr. White to the dead man called Mr. Mills. His eyes were open now. They’d been shut just moments earlier. Not one else seemed to have noticed, so he turned back to Mr. White.
He offered him a gentle smile, reached out with his hand, and said, “Let me help you.”
He took the gentleman by the hand, though he struggled, and dragged him across the room as Mills truly began to wake. Without warning, Mr. White drew a knife that was tucked into his trousers. But he’d played his last card too soon.
“None of that,” said Anthony, taking the knife from him.
He pressed it against White’s throat, letting it nick his skin. It drew just a few beads of blood, which sent Mills into a frenzy. Anthony frowned. He hoped the unliving man’s straps would hold. The smell of the blood seemed to be driving him absolutely mad. He writhed, kicked, and fought against his restraints. But the straps held tight.
Mills bared his teeth, slobbering like a rabid dog as his prey approached. Anthony dragged his captive across the floor, letting the knife dig into Mr. White’s skin whenever he resisted.
When they reached the table, he pressed the knife hard into Mr. White’s neck, spilling blood on the floor. He gave a hard shove, sending the man sprawling toward the table. He stumbled hard, his hands grasping his slit throat and choking up blood as he ran into the table.
Mills twisted violently upon the table, forcing his straps to their limit, as he reached out and seized his prey. White’s blood-thick screams were cut short as Mills tore into his throat, ripping out his trachea with sharp incisors.
Still, the gentlemen drank their tea. Some of them clapped politely as if witnessing a scene in a particularly gruesome opera. Anthony smiled and took a bow.
“They were both unharmed,” said one of the gentlemen, abruptly.
Anthony was high on the thrill of the kill, his good mood barely soured by the news. He ought to feel guilty. He’d always believed that every human life was precious. But that was what this was all about, wasn’t it? Saving lives? If Mr. O and his men wanted to interfere with that cause, they would pay the ultimate price. And Anthony refused to feel guilty about that.
But it was strange. It wasn’t merely a lack of guilt that he felt. It was rapture. Utter, unbelievable ecstasy. What had happened to him? What was he becoming? Whatever it was, it didn’t matter, he realised. All that mattered was the plan.
“But they took the girl. They took her body with them when they fled. They will get the message,” said the gentleman.
Anthony nodded, blood on his hands. He wiped his hands on his pants and put Mr. White’s knife down on a nearby table.
“Well done, Anthony,” said the gentleman.
“Thank you,” said Anthony, over the sound of the cannibal corpse, “Father.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene Two</Title>
            <Text>Annabel settled back into her seat. It was an effort to sit still, being in the same room as the horrible old woman who’d shot her with a tranquilizer dart laced with the Lazarus virus. Even if Annabel did seem to be immune to the virus, it wasn’t a risk she’d wanted to take. So it was for Mr. O’s sake and his alone that Annabel resisted the urge to strangle his bitch of a mother.
“This should be good,” she said sarcastically.
Mrs. Grimmer’s crinkled the corners of her lips upward and squinted. Annabel thought she might have been smiling. A moment later, the expression melted away.
“Thank you all for coming,” said Mrs. Grimmer as the tea arrived. She took a sip of it and scowled appreciatively. “You must be wondering why I’ve asked you all to meet here. To make a long story short, my late husband, Mr. Grimmer, was the founder of a top-secret agency known as The Hunting Society. The Hunting Society had one purpose: to protect the city of London from a deadly creature known as a zombie. A creature, once human, that now feeds on the flesh of the living.”
“Ah, hell, must’ve had too much to drink again. I could’ve sworn you just said that there are zombies roaming the city, eating the living,” said Edward Steen.
Mrs. Grimmer nodded. “I did,” she replied.
Edward Steen swallowed. He looked down at his drink.
“Shit,” he said, and took another swig.
“Now, just hold on one minute,” said Mrs. Hatton. When the room quieted to listen, she seemed at a loss for what to say.
Mrs. Grimmer sighed. “I knew we should have begun with small talk,” she said.
“Why was this virus kept secret?” Annabel wanted to know. “Shouldn’t the general populace be warned about the existence of these creatures so that they might be better prepared to deal with them? Wouldn’t the police be better equipped to deal with the Resurrectionists?”
Mrs. Grimmer nodded in her direction. “There are Resurrectionists within the police force. Members of parliament, even the monarchy. The Resurrectionists have planted their seeds everywhere,” she said. “As for alerting the general population, that would have been ideal. However, it was Mr. Grimmer’s belief was that if man discovered anything sufficiently deadly, he would find a way to use it as a weapon. Electricity, fire, even gravity can be used as instruments of war. Disease is no exception. Disease can, and has, been used to great effect as weapon. The British Army had used it when they gave blankets contaminated with smallpox to the Native Americans. And during the times of the Black Death, plague corpses were used in warfare. Throughout history, there have been instances of contaminating wells with the diseased remains of infected animals. But this disease, this virus, if it were to be used as a weapon, as my husband feared, the devastation it would unleash would be beyond what anyone could imagine. Virulent in its effects, highly volatile, and incredibly contagious, the Lazarus Virus is unlike any other disease known to man.”
“By god,” said Mr. Lockwood.
“Is that what’s happened then?” said Mr. Ocelot, somehow one step ahead of the conversation. Given the extent of their social circles, it was surprising that their paths had never before crossed, but Annabel had of course heard of Henry Charles Ocelot. He was notorious. And now, she could see why. He was perceptive. “The Resurrectionists are planning to use this virus as a weapon?”
“That's what we thought, at first,” said Mrs. Grimmer. “They've been searching for a cure. My husband believed their plan was to unleash the virus, then sell the cure.”
Mr. Ocelot nodded intelligently. “But now you believe differently?” he said. “What are the Resurrectionists really planning?”
Mr. Palmer took the lead here.
“An experiment,” he said. "They call it Project Dead London. An experiment intended to test the hypothesis that the infection rate for the virus is not one hundred percent. They believe there are certain people who are actually immune.”
“That cannot be all,” said Mr. Ocelot.
Squeezing a bit of lemon into her tea, Mrs. Grimmer answered the question. “The idea is that if immunity is possible, it might be possible to replicate it.”
“If they can find people with immunity, they can create their cure?” Annabel summarized.
“More than that. The Lazarus Virus literally kills its hosts, before bringing them back, so to speak. But zombies are still dead. If the virus can then be cured, the lucky individual will technically remain dead, and yet, they will regain control of their higher functions. Unable to age, to be afflicted by sickness, unable to die. No longer be zombies, yet no longer living. Essentially, they will have beaten death.”
“By god!” Mr. Lockwood exclaimed again.
Annabel had to agree with that sentiment.
“They're trying to cure death by killing millions of people? Bloody lunatic boffins," she muttered.
“I have been working, in secret, along with Mr. Palmer, to undermine their efforts to put the Dead London project in motion, but my efforts thus far have proved fruitless. I believe a direct approach has become necessary, which is why I have organised this meeting. We must confront the Resurrectionists and put a stop to their plan.”
“In that at least, we agree,” said Mr. O. “The problem is that we don’t know their plan. Or rather, we know that they wish to spread the Lazarus Virus, and we now know why. What we don’t know is how.”
Mrs. Grimmer tilted her head and made a gesture with her hand as if to say, “Well…”
“Ah. We do know,” he said with an apprehensive smile. “Well, then I suppose all we need is a counterstrategy. Or do you have that worked out as well?”
Mrs. Grimmer repeated her hand gesture and gave an apologetic shrug.
“Of course you do.”
Much as Annabel disliked the woman, she had to give the woman a certain amount of begrudging respect. At least she was resourceful. The problem, of course, was that Annabel couldn’t believe a single word Mrs. Grimmer had to say. Annabel kept that thought to herself, however. She had put her trust in Mr. O, and if he wanted to trust Mrs. Grimmer, then she was willing to do the same, albeit cautiously.
It was Mrs. Hatton, to Annabel’s pleasant surprise, that voiced her concerns as to Mrs. Grimmer’s intentions.
“That is all very well and good,” she said. “The problem, Mrs. Grimmer, is that you are asking us to believe quite a lot on faith. And as we have only very recently become acquaintances, how can we be certain that what you are telling us is the truth?”
Mrs. Grimmer glared at Mrs. Hatton. The two of them made quite the pair. They were of an age. Mrs. Grimmer was tall and thin, while Mrs. Hatton was petite in stature but with a curvaceous figure. The both were dressed in skirts and petticoats, with pearls about their necks, and wide-brimmed hats trimmed with lace atop their heads. They could have been sisters, or cousins perhaps, but while Mrs. Grimmer wore a constantly furrowed brow and an arrogant sneer upon her lips, Mrs. Hatton had a pleasing facial expression. Evidently, the shorter, plumper Mrs. Hatton was sharper than she let on.
“Honestly,” Mrs. Grimmer replied coldly, “We don’t have time for this. I leave it entirely up to you. It seems I was wrong to expect you all to trust me, but I wonder, can you live with yourselves if it turns out that I was telling the truth and you did nothing to stop the Dead London experiment? When every man, woman, and child is a walking, hungry cadaver, will you not think to yourself, if only I had listened?”
Mrs. Hatton was not to be deterred. “I hardly think that what I’m asking for is unreasonable,” she said.
“What are you asking for?” asked Mrs. Grimmer.
“Answers,” said Mrs. Hatton. “The society you described, which your husband founded. The Hunting Society, I believe you called it. They hunted zombies. But how did they discover these zombies in the first place?”
Mrs. Grimmer looked at her son. Her mouth was still set in that condescending expression of hers, but in her eyes there was a hint of something more. Sadness, perhaps.
“It’s a long story,” she said.</Text>

            <Title>Scene Two</Title>
            <Text>Having finally surrendered to the notion that she was not likely to shake Mr. O without first hearing him out, as well as to the somewhat more unsettling fact that her life was in danger and that therefore she was likely safer in his presence than on her own, Miss Monday had chosen a bench in the shade, which overlooked the Serpentine.
Her umbrella, somewhat dented by her recent altercation, was unfurled in order to act as a parasol; though it was not pretty and delicate as a parasol ought to be, Miss Monday did not want to take any risks. Her complexion was fair, and she was liable to burn even in the shade. The gloomy weather had cleared somewhat, allowing an unexpected glimpse of the sun, which crept through the trees and cast shadows about the park. Shadows which continued to catch Miss Monday’s eye and which caused her to constantly check to see that she and Mr. O were still alone.
“Tea?” she offered, opening up her picnic basket and withdrawing a canteen as well as two small teacups, luckily unbroken during her fight.
“Seriously?” said her companion.
“I never go anywhere unprepared,” said Miss Monday. “And besides, it’s a beautiful day for a picnic, is it not?”
She filled a cup for herself, and after a nod from Mr. O, filled the other one as well.
“No lemon in mine, thank you,” he said.
Miss Monday laughed, remembering the last time they’d taken tea together.
“Now, what was so important that caused you to fly all the way over here to meet me?” she demanded, once she’d confirmed that they were alone.
“The package you took from Lord Connor’s safe,” he said, looking at her in a way that was surprisingly gentle. “Do you know what it is?”
Miss Monday shook her head. “Of course I don’t,” she said with mild annoyance. “I don’t concern myself with those kind of details.”
“But aren’t you curious?” he asked, leaning just a bit closer to her. She shifted in her seat, moving away from him, and he apologised. “I’m sorry,” he said. “I don’t mean to pry into your business.”
She raised an eyebrow.
“Well, alright,” he conceded, “I do mean to pry. But only in the interest of public safety.”
“You keep saying that,” she said.
She blew on her tea to help it cool, and took a sip.
“Well, it’s true,” he said. “How much do you know about the men who hired you? Lord Connor was a good man, and you were willing to kill him, based on their word.”
She snorted. “A good man? I thought your business was information, Mr. O,” she said. “I vetted him. I spent every night this week following him as he slinked out of his house in disguise. I pursued him as he patrolled the streets of Whitechapel until he managed to find a victim who suited him.”
Mr. O took a sip of his tea. He winced. “Hot,” he remarked. He set the cup down on the bench. “Monsters,” he said. “Lord Connor was hunting monsters.”
“He worked with you, you mean?” she asked.
Mr. O nodded. “So. How much do you know about your clients?”
“Not much at all,” she admitted. “My clients like their anonymity, as you can imagine. That’s part of what makes me so popular. I don’t ask too many questions. I never meet them face to face. We have a system, which we use to pass messages back and forth. The man I’ve been dealing with is called Francis Langtry. A pseudonym, of course.”
“Langtry?” he repeated.
“Is the name familiar to you?”
He shrugged. “Only in regard to the actress, Miss Lillie Langtry,” he said. “But the name Francis is common enough. For example…” He paused mid-sentence, to laugh at himself. He shook his head. “Is that not the first name of Varney?”
She was familiar with that name, of course. Who wasn’t, really? Like Sweeney Todd and Spring-Heeled Anthony, Varney the Vampire had charmed his way into the imagination of Londoners with his diabolical misdeeds. Yes, she thought, it was Francis Varney. But that had nothing to do with Langtry.
She suppressed a sigh. “Do you know what’s in the package?” she asked, trying to keep him on track.
“I have an inkling,” he admitted.
“But you’re not sure?” she asked.
“No,” he said, “But if my suspicion is correct…”
“What?” she said, leaning in closer to him now.
“Never mind,” he said, “We won’t know until you open it.”
She reached into her basket, and finding the parcel, drew it out. She gazed at it with mounting curiosity. She had very little reason to trust Mr. O, but his point was no less valid simply because she didn’t trust him. And he’d been the one to provide her with the combination to the safe in the first place.
The truth was that she had just as little reason to trust her employers. They’d convinced her of Lord Connor’s vileness. They’d told her to follow him to Whitechapel, knowing she’d catch him bludgeoning men and women to death in dark alleyways. And knowing what conclusion she would make upon witnessing these acts. But if what Mr. O said was true, that Connor had been hunting monsters, the question was, had her clients been ignorant as she had? Or had they set her up?
If that were true, she had every reason to open the package and find out exactly what it was that she was delivering. Still, she hesitated.
“I’m sorry, Mr. O,” she said, “I can’t.”
“I understand,” he said, “Although I wish you would reconsider.”
She shook her head. “As a matter of professional pride, I would never violate the privacy of my clients. Not without knowing…”
Mr. O nodded. He sat quietly beside her, his eyes fixed on the gently lapping waters of the Serpentine before them. A mother duck and her ducklings paddled along the shore of the murky waters. His eyes followed them, though his thoughts seemed elsewhere.
“You’re a thief with principles,” said Mr. O. “How quaint.”
Miss Monday bristled in annoyance. “A thief can’t have principles?”
“I just wish you’d keep your story straight,” he said with a shrug. “Yesterday, you balked when I suggested your past might weigh heavily on your conscience. Today, you’re a thief with scruples.”
“Let me be clear, then,” said Miss Monday. She looked him straight in the eyes. “I do bad things, Mr. O. I do bad things, and I laugh at all the money I’m making. I laugh because I used to be a scared little orphan girl, stealing just to stay alive, and now I steal because it’s fun. But for all that, I’m not stealing from the working class. I’m not running amok, killing innocents willy-nilly. I’ve killed, yes. And I’ve stolen—oh, the things I’ve stolen, you’d hardly believe it if I told you. But if you’re looking to lay a guilt trip on somebody, you’ll have to look elsewhere.”
“Very well,” he said with a shrug.
Miss Monday folded her arms, hardly disguising her annoyance at the casual way in which he’d managed to dismiss everything she’d just said.
Mr. O took a sip of tea. A gentle breeze stirred the willows around them. Cherry blossoms floated on the wind, becoming entrapped in the weeping willows, like moths caught in a spider’s web.
“I’m taking a substantial risk in telling you this,” said Mr. O, breaking the idyllic calm. “But I’ve already said more to you of the nature of my business than I would tell just anyone. Ordinarily, I believe it is my task to keep secrets, rather than to reveal them. But in this instance, I believe my secrets will do more damage if I keep them than reveal them to you.”
Miss Monday found her curiosity deepening in spite of herself. “And what secrets do you have to reveal to me, Mr. O?” she asked him.</Text>

            <Title>The Mad Priest's cellmate was talktative, which was</Title>
            <Text>Three Years Earlier

The Mad Priest’s cellmate was talkative, which was both a blessing and a curse—a blessing because he’d been wanting for company, a curse because he was beginning to feel that Parson Sinews enjoyed talking simply to hear his own voice.
“Before you woke me,” he said, “I dreamt that Camille was dead. What do you make of that, Father? Wishful thinking?”
“Who is Camille?” Pieres asked.
“My fiancé,” came the reply from the darkness. “It was her that dragged me to this hell on earth, you know. Resurrectionist bitch. Now that I’ve seen her true colors, I wonder if she ever loved me, or was it all just to see what I knew about their organization? I was something of an expert on the Resurrectionists. I helped the police with uncovering the identity of Anthony Tidkins, their leader. I predicted their Dead London Project, but I was powerless to stop it.”
“Dead London Project?” the Mad Priest repeated.
His fellow prisoner laughed darkly. “Oh yes, I suppose you’ve been locked in here long enough that you wouldn’t have heard. The Dead London Project was an experiment. The Resurrectionists believed they could cure death, if they could only test their hypothesis on a large enough test population. They decided the population of London would suffice and began spreading a virus called Lazarus throughout the city. Those exposed to the virus experience a death of the body but remain animated. The Resurrectionists hoped to find a means of curing the virus’s side effects—namely, an intense hunger for the flesh of the living—but first, they needed to unleash the virus. I was locked up in their laboratory when the experiment was ongoing, so I didn’t have a chance to see the results.”
The Mad Priest let out a sigh he’d been holding for the last two years. A long, tired sigh. He lingered by the bars that separated his cell from his fellow prisoner’s. He stood there for a while without speaking.
“That’s what I saw,” Father Pieres said eventually. “That’s why they put me in here. I saw a man who’d been infected with this virus, the result of a Resurrectionist experiment. I ran to summon a policeman; instead, I found a Resurrectionist. I’ve been here ever since.”
He caught another glint of green eyes as a flash of lightning from outside lit his prison mate’s face. A moment later, thunder followed lightning.
“How will you escape?” asked the priest, changing the subject.
“How did you know that’s what I was thinking about?”
“Every prisoner imagines escaping,” Pieres answered. “It wouldn’t be a prison if the prisoners were content to stay put. After all—” He broke off at the sound of the guards making their rounds.
“Don’t look in this one’s eyes,” one of them was saying.
“Why not?” said a second voice.
“Orders,” said the first guard.
“Orders? From who?”
“Same person that dragged him here. Dr. Karnstein.”
The small metal door slid open and a tray of something vaguely resembling food was shoved into his cell. His stomach growled, and he scooped the plate off the floor.
“What is this?” Parson Sinews demanded.
“You were expecting tea and crumpets?” asked the guard. He laughed and marched onward.
Pieres, for his part, sat on the bed and ate hungrily. Cold porridge with a few dark brown chunks of dried fruit. “Was that name familiar to you?” he asked between bites. “Dr. Karnstein?”
“An alias of Camille’s. All of the Resurrectionists use aliases, usually from penny dreadfuls and gothic novels. Camille’s was Mircalla Karnstein, from Carmilla. So, what you were saying before…about escape…”
“Yes,” said Pieres, “well, merely that I’ve been here for something close to two years already. I’ve lost track of the days. Yet every day I’m confined in my cell, do you know what I think of?”
“I can imagine,” Sinews answered.
He grunted appreciatively as he ate his meal, while his new friend struggled to keep his down. Finishing his meal, he set down the empty, metal plate.
“I imagine that after two years in this place, you have come up with some ideas?” Sinews asked.
Pieres nodded. “It will take patience,” he said.
“I can be patient,” Sinews answered.
“And dedication,” Pieres added.
“I can be dedicated.”
“And when the time comes…”
“Yes?”
“Take me with you,” Pieres pleaded. “Promise me you’ll take me with you.”
“We’re in this together, old man,” said Parson Sinews, green eyes twinkling. Against his better judgment, the priest believed him. “Now, tell me, what is your plan?”
The Mad Priest stood up from the bed and hobbled over on his cane. “First, come over here. There’s something you need to know about this prison.”
His cellmate did as bidden and came to stand at the edge of their cells. The priest directed Sinews’ attention to the window in his cell, a narrow gap that stood above his bed.
“There’s no window in your cell, so we’ll need to find a way to get you from your cell into mine. Once we’ve managed that—”
“It looks wide enough to climb through,” Sinews interrupted, “and there are no bars on the window.”
“Yes, well, that’s true. The problem, though, is what’s on the other side of the window.”
He thought he saw understanding finally dawn in the prisoner’s green eyes. Sinews was clearly intelligent, and he’d obviously felt the floor shifting beneath him, but even so, his first guess was probably wrong. “We’re not at sea, if that’s what you’re thinking,” said the priest.
“Where are we?” Sinews asked, standing on the tips of his toes for a better look.
There were thick black storm clouds raging outside, and periodically, flashes of lightning followed by deafening thunder. But if his prison mate could get a closer look, he’d have seen that the clouds were beneath them.
“A thousand feet above the ground,” he answered. “So…now you understand why no one has ever escaped Chateau d’If...it’s an airship. The Resurrectionists use other, smaller ships to refuel and bring supplies aboard without ever needing to land. We’re adrift aboard a castle in the sky, and the only chance of escape is to jump.”
He watched as the full weight of reality set in to Parson Sinews’ expressive, jade eyes. The Mad Priest’s pity slowly gave way to an unsettling feeling. His cellmate’s lips stretched into a deranged parody of a smile, and he began to laugh.</Text>

            <Title>Scene Four</Title>
            <Text>Withdrawing a deck of ancient-looking cards from a paper box, she spread them out upon the table. Seventy-eight cards in all, Sinews counted.
“You want to find Dr. Allen,” said Atropos, “You want to know if you can find him, and you want to know if you will find him. More than that, you want to know how your lives are intertwined. In what way are your fates connected. Does he kill you? Do you kill him?”
“Do you fall in love and live happily ever after?” Clotho suggested.
Atropos scowled.
Ignoring the younger sister, Sinews nodded. “That about sums it up.”
“Good,” said Atropos. “I want you to focus on those questions, and while you are doing so, I want you to pick three cards.”
Sinews did as instructed. “Those three,” he said, pointing at each one in turn.
Clotho grinned, that hideous grin of hers that said she knew something that Sinews did not. Alice and Dorothy hissed beneath the table, but when he checked beneath it, he couldn’t see a thing in the dark lighting.
Clotho turned over the first card.
Lachesis turned over the second.
Atropos took the third card in her bony hand and looked at it herself. For a moment, she was still. Then, at last, she placed the card on the table beside the others.
“The first card is past,” said Clotho, pointing to the card.
“The second card is present,” said Lachesis.
“And I suppose you can guess what the third card is,” said Atropos.
“I suppose I can,” said Parson, “But what do they all mean? I’m sure I’ve never seen any of these cards before.”
“You’ve had tarot readings before, then?” asked Clotho.
“Yes,” he said.
“Though never have you had a tarot reading by the Moirae,” said Atropos.
“This is our own special deck,” said Lachesis.
“The whore,” said Clotho, pointing to the first card, a naked lady lying on a bed of gold coins.
Atropos coughed.
“The harlot,” said Clotho.
“Sins of the flesh?” asked Mr. Sinews.
“No,” said Clotho, “She represents compromising one’s ideals for the sake of money, power, and so on. Twisted ambition, selling one’s soul to the devil, and that sort of thing.”
“So, in the context of Dr. Allen?”
Clotho shook her head. “Well,” she said with a sly smile, “That is for you to determine. I’m just telling you what the cards mean.”
Lachesis pointed to the second card, a man walking about with his eyes closed.
“The blind man?” he asked.
“The somnambulist,” she said.
Sinews nodded. “What does it mean?”
“It means you only have to open your eyes and you’ll see.”
“Well, that certainly helps,” he said.
“It means you are a willing participant to your own deception,” she said, “You’re being lied to; you can see that, but you don’t want to.”
Sinews felt a bit sickened by the card. What was he missing? How was he being deceived? Sinews had always prided himself on being able to determine when someone was lying to him. He’d done it earlier in the evening, with Mrs. Hatton.
“Then again,” said Lachesis.
“Yes?”
“It is also possible,” she said, “That the somnambulist is Dr. Allen. According to your theory, he was robbed of his free will by a drug that he concocted. Turned into a zombie, you said. I suppose, if this is true, the card indicates that the power to regain free will must come from within; Dr. Allen must open his own eyes.”
“And the last card?”
“The Five of Tentacles,” said Atropos.
“Is it not usually pentacles?” asked Mr. Sinews.
“It is,” said Atropos, “But as we said, this is our own, very special deck.”
“And what do tentacles represent?”
“They represent being caught up in something,” said Atropos, “In this case, caught by a hideous tentacled beast.”
“So, entanglement?”
“Yes,” said Atropos, “Capture. Imprisonment.”
“So, I don’t kill Dr. Allen? I capture him?”
Atropos shook her head. “What makes you so sure it’s Allen who is to be captured, and not yourself? And besides, the cards aren’t usually quite so literal as that. Entanglement is analogous with obsession. It could represent your inability to let go of this quest for answers in a mystery that quite honestly should have nothing to do with you. The fact that your fate is intertwined with that of Dr. Allen is your own doing. That’s what tentacles mean.”
“What about five?” he asked, “Why the five of tentacles?”
She gestured to the card itself. It depicted a diverging path: on one side, darkness, and on the other, five writhing tentacles. “Five is usually a card of balance, change, and choice. In this case, the choice is clear: the tentacled beast on one side.”
“Darkness on the other,” Sinews finished.
“No,” said Atropos, “Not darkness. The unknown.”
Sinews looked up at Atropos. Again he made the mistake of looking into her eyes. Those terrifying eyes. He had never felt so exposed as when he looked into those eyes of hers, those eyes that could see his very soul if she only stared long enough and hard enough.
“You wonder, if what we say is true, that we hold dominion over past, present, and future, why we would show you a card that presents you with a choice,” she said.
He managed to look away, at last. A cold sweat had broken out upon his brow. His heart was beating like a hammer inside his chest.
“Fate is not set in stone, Mr. Sinews,” she told him.
“It’s set in string,” said Clotho, a pair of spiders dangling from her robes, inching their way toward the floor. He felt the urge to point them out to her, but he was not entirely certain the spiders were not visions induced by la fée verte.
“The length of your life is determined,” said Lachesis.
“And the nature of your birth.”
“And your death,” said Atropos.
“But string is flexible,” said Lachesis, that hissing sound coming from beneath her robes again. “You make your own path, Mr. Sinews. You make your own choices.”
“And you live with them,” said Atropos. “But tell me, Mr. Sinews. You have a bride-to-be. The love of your life, isn’t she? You said she made a moth of you, that you could not resist the flames of love, isn’t that right?”
Mr. Sinews nodded.
“Then what are you doing here, with us, trying to track down a deranged surgeon? Why aren’t you with your love?”
Atropos turned the cards over, shuffled them back into the deck, and then, much to Mr. Sinews’ surprise, turned on the oil lamp above them. Almost instantly, there was a whirlwind of motion within Atropos’ robes, and the sound of scurrying, fluttering. From her sleeves and from her billowing hood, there was an eruption of moths. Hundreds of them. Large yellow moths, which took to the air in a flurry of motion.
Some of them were snapped up by a pair of tentacles which emerged from within Lachesis’ robes. No, not tentacles. They were snakes. The rest of the moths flitted about the oil lamp. Burnt and dead moths began to litter the floor and the table.
“Must be,” he said, “A very potent bottle of absinthe.”
“Go home, Parson,” said Atropos, “Give up this business with Dr. Allen. Love awaits you.”
Mr. Sinews shook his head and dared not make eye contact with Atropos. Somehow he was more afraid of her and her moths than he was of Alice and Dorothy, the snakes between the legs of Lachesis.
“Look,” said Atropos, “Not all of these moths are dead. Love is a risk. I can’t say that it’s not. But there is hope. This business with Dr. Allen will bring you nothing but pain.”
“I thought you weren’t going to tell me my future,” he said.
“I wasn’t,” she said.
“What about the recipe?” asked Clotho.
“No,” said Atropos. She looked at Sinews with sadness in her eyes. “It’s time you took your leave, sir.”
Sinews spared one last look at the trio, and felt with utter certainty that they were indeed the Moirae, that they did indeed have domain over past, present, and future. Birth, life, and death.
He put on his coat, retrieved his cane, and opened the door. As he was about to leave, he turned around and spoke into the shadows, into which the Moirae must have disappeared.
“Alright then,” he said, “I will cease my investigation into Dr. Allen.”
He closed the door behind him, its bells jingling as he stepped out into the rain.
“Mr. Sinews,” said a voice.
“Yes,” he said, looking into the face of a police officer.
“You are under arrest for the murder of Rachelle Vincent,” said the police officer.
Sinews felt as if he’d just been stabbed in the chest.
“No,” he said, tears coming unbidden to his eyes. He collapsed to his knees, drenching himself with rain water and mud. “No!” he cried, latching on to the word like an infant who’s learned his first word. “No, no, no.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Synopsis>Finally, Annabel confronts Dr. Simms, who reveals that Jack was the bastard son of Dr. Allen and Mrs. Grimmer, while Jonathan was also born of an affair and is not truly Mrs. Grimmer’s son. Jack’s Dead London plan was concocted to save his dying father, and Mrs. Grimmer was complicit because Jack is her son and Dr. Allen was her lover. She hated Jonathan because he was not her son and reminded her of her husband’s unfaithfulness and the fact that she’d given up her own son while he’d not done the same.

Following this revelation, Annabel and Abraham run into Jack. Annabel puts a bullet in his skull, while the unliving begin to fill the halls of the underground.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Annabel turned to Abraham.
“Did you know?” she demanded.
“Know what?”
She lowered her pistol, but kept a firm grip on the scientist, and kept the other boffins in her sight. Threat lingered in her eyes, and the kept their wary distance. These were doctors, not soldiers. Even if they were brainwashed, they seemed likely not to intervene so long as she retained the upper hand.
“She must have known,” she said to Abraham. “I knew not to trust that wretched woman.”
“Mrs. Grimmer?”
“She knew,” Annabel insisted. “She knew we’d be too late, counted on it even. She led us to straight to the sites where the Lazarus Virus was to be spread, either to divert our attention or in the hopes that we’d be exposed. She led the pair of us straight into the den of snakes. She has been with them all along.”
Abraham shook his head, speechless though there was something in Annabel’s words which must have stopped him from disagreeing. Perhaps a part of him had always suspected Mrs. Grimmer.
“But she wasn’t brainwashed,” he said at last. “Why would she…?”
“Are you sure she wasn’t? How can you tell? Would her brain have been scrambled like Dr. Simms’?”
“Hey, watch how you speak about your elders and betters!” Dr. Simms objected.
“Elders, yes. Betters, my left tit!” Annabel scoffed.
She looked to Abraham for an answer.
“Memory loss is one side effect, but not everyone seems to display that symptom. There are other, more obvious side effects to the drugs, however,” he said. “Look here. Notice these red marks on his skin?”
He gestured to the doctor. She could see the marks, like little red freckles that dotted his skin. “So, why would Mrs. Grimmer be in on it, without being brainwashed. It goes against everything her husband had stood for.”
Annabel didn’t have an answer for that. But she did have an idea. She raised her pistol once more, pointed it at Dr. Simms once again.
“What happens to a man who dies of the virus, supposing he is cured?” she asked, directing her question not to the mad boffin but to the room. “Does he come back to life?”
“Not exactly,” said one of the scientists.
“Explain,” she said, gesturing with the gun.
“Well, he would still be dead, technically, and yet not. He would likely regain his higher brain functions, his body would not rot. But as he would technically be dead, he would not age. He would be unbound by the ravages of time. That’s why this is so important,” he explained, his passion increasing as he spoke.
He moved closer, edging around the writhing bodies of the zombies while he talked. Annabel warned him off with the gun.
“Important enough to risk killing every man, woman, and child in London?” she exclaimed. She shook her head as if to clear it, like a dog shaking rain from its fur. “So that’s why Mrs. Grimmer agreed to this? Immortality?”
She paused, straining to think, despite now knowing that there was no stopping the Dead London Project, that even as they spoke, the city was being destroyed by the virus. She pushed that thought aside and forced herself to think about Mrs. Grimmer. Think about why she would betray her son, betray the memory of her husband. Could she truly be so desperate for eternal life as a corpse?
“No, there has to be more to it than that. It can’t be as simple as immortality, at least not for herself. For someone else, maybe, but…”
“Jack,” Dr. Simms muttered, his voice barely a whisper.
Annabel leaned forward. “What was that?”
He repeated it, once, then again, and added as clarification, “And his father, Dr. Allen.”
Annabel paused. She looked at Abraham, then back at the doctor again, forgetting to hold him at gunpoint. She looked him straight in the eye.
“Dr. Allen wasn’t Jack’s father,” she said. “He was his mentor.”
Dr. Simms had an odd expression on his face, as if for the first time he was capable of looking at her and remembering exactly who she was to him. The expression faded, and he returned to his usual bewildered self. Then, in another moment of brief clarity, he blurted out a reply.
“Jack was Dr. Allen’s bastard. His mother was a married woman, so she was forced to give him away. The family that got him had been trying to have children of their own but couldn’t. A doctor and his wife. They took him in. Then the mother died, and the father grew to resent the boy. So he sent him away to live with his real father, also a doctor. He told the boy it was because Dr. Allen was a renowned surgeon, but the truth was that he simply didn’t want the boy.”
“How do you know all this?” Abraham demanded, startling the doctor.
Annabel shushed him, putting a gentle hand on Dr. Simms shoulder.
“Who was the mother?” Annabel asked. And when he continued to look confused, she added, “The real mother, I mean. The married woman that gave him away.”
“Elizabeth Grimmer,” he said. Then his eyes seemed to go blank. When they refocused, he was smiling. “Such a pretty lass. What’s your name, my dear?”
Annabel looked at Abraham and gestured for him to follow her lead. Keeping her eye on the scientists, her gun trained on them over Dr. Simms shoulder, she backed towards the door, bringing the doctor with her. When she reached the door, she let him go, stepped into the hall, and closed the door.
“Dr. Allen was gravely ill,” she told him, as she pulled a pin from her hair and used it to tamper with the doorknob, ensuring that the boffins were locked inside. She could pick a lock easily enough; it was a bit harder to break one in order to lock it from the outside, but not impossible. “Infected with the virus.”
“If he was a former lover, the father of her child, that could explain why she would go along with Jack’s scheme.”
“True,” she agreed, continuing to work at the lock. “But how could she choose Jack over Jonathan? How could she choose one son over another?”
Abraham offered a shrug. “Maybe Jonathan wasn’t really her son.”
“You think Charles Grimmer might have had an affair of his own, that he kept his child born out of wedlock, while Elizabeth Grimmer was forced to give her own son away?”
She finished with the lock.
“It’s possible,” she admitted. She stood up, turned to head back down the hallway in the direction from which they’d come. But when she pivoted on her heel, she nearly collided with a man. She jumped back in surprise. How he’d crept up on her so silently, she hadn’t the slightest idea, but she recognised him immediately. Her recognition did little to calm her.
His mask still strapped to his head, but pulled up to sit upon his forehead instead of his face, he stood before her. Jack. Anthony Tidkins. The Resurrection Man. Scientist, leader of an underground society, bastard son of Dr. Allen and Mrs. Grimmer, to Annabel he was an estranged father figure. To the city of London, he was a scourge.
“Is it really too late?” she asked him.
“For London, or for us?” he wanted to know.
“For London,” she replied. Careful not to let her emotion show, she looked him in the eye and with careful inflection, she told him, “You and I are most definitely finished.”
He nodded.
“Fair enough.”
Perhaps she was mistaken, but she thought she detected a hint of regret in his pale red eyes, a note of sadness in his voice. Damn him, what did she care of his sadness, mass murderer that he was? She felt sick to think of what he had done.
“As is London,” he added.
Her stomach clenched. She knew why he’d done it. Jack had always had such endearing respect for life. Every life, precious, every single one. Even hers. That’s why he’d saved her all those years ago. Now he was trying to save his father, trying to stop death from coming to his door. Instead, he’d opened the door, invited death inside.
Her hand was trembling, her vision unclear. She steeled herself. Before she could put further thought into it, she raised her pistol. Point blank, she aimed its muzzle at her oldest friend and put her finger on the trigger. His eyes widened, and without another word, without another thought, she put a bullet in his skull.
She gasped with relief and regret and anguish as his blood spattered across her cheek, hot and wet. It seemed to sting as it struck her skin.
Beside her, Abraham gasped in surprise, but Annabel’s attention was focused on Jack’s body. His eyes and mouth wide with surprise, a gaping hole through his left cheek, his body lay still on the floor.
Annabel’s knees threatened to buckle, and tears formed in her eye, but she kept herself upright, thrust her weapon into its holster, and turned away from the body.
“We’ve got to go,” Abraham was saying, as Annabel recovered her nerves and steadied herself.
He was gesturing towards something off in the distance. She blinked the tears from her eyes and looked. The zombies were staggering down the hall towards them.</Text>
            <Notes>Where to begin? For starters, try to find a way to portray Abraham Palmer as the betrayer in their midst. He was playing both sides, pretending to be on Annabel’s side only to get her out of the way until the plan could be put in motion.

Reveal that Dr. Simms’ memory loss is not indicative of the serum’s effects. The only clear symptom is a physical sign - a discolouration of the skin. This means it’s possible for people to conceal that they are brainwashed. In other words, Palmer may have lied.

Can I still also reveal that Jack’s father was really Dr. Allen? Can I reveal that Mrs. Grimmer was his mother? Not sure if possible.</Notes>

            <Title>Hoist the sails!</Title>
            <Text>“Unfurl the sails!” roared Jonathan Grimmer, even as his grip tightened on the railing and his stomach churned.
The command was echoed by the deck hands, who busied themselves with carrying out the task. The Penny Dreadful’s sails unfurled beneath its hulking gondola, catching the wind beneath the ship. Propellers whirred on all sides, while above, affixed to the steel beams that surrounded the blimp, vast wings of canvas spread and retracted. The sound of the ship’s wings beating like those of an enormous bird, the whir of the ship’s propellers, the mechanical clang of clockwork machinery, the wind in the sails, and the hiss of steam pumped out a rhythm which became calming as it became familiar.
They had circled London several times over, and until now, there had been no sign of the abomination. Now, they had spied the wreckage left in the wake of some enormous beast. The trail led east, then disappeared, as if whatever had caused the wreckage was airborne.
“Adjust course!” Jonathan shouted, knees still shaking. He knew the crew could handle the ship without him playing at captain, but he wasn't going to get any better at this by slinking away to the ship's lounge and drinking till he forgot he was a mile high, as he usually did. “Plot a course due east.”
There was a lurch as the massive airship adjusted its course and began to head east. Jonathan's stomach settled somewhere in his throat.
“It can’t have gone too much further outside the city,” he muttered, clutching the railing with white knuckles. He managed to let go with one hand in order to peer through a small handheld telescope. After several years of expeditions aboard the airship, Jonathan still felt that sickening gut-wrenching vertigo whenever he flew. He’d inherited the Dreadful from his father. He hadn’t asked for it. He tucked the telescope away and held on with both hands.
“I wouldn’t be so sure.” Kasumi approached from the cabin, sword slung over her shoulder, jet black hair dancing in the wind. “If this thing really is a Resurrectionist experiment, there’s no telling how fast it might be.”
Jonathan shuddered. He’d seen Resurrectionist experiments before, the Dead London Project being the worst among them. The once-glorious city lay in ruins behind them, the zombie-infected city quarantined within an enormous wall that encircled its perimeter, all thanks to the Resurrectionists. Infectious gas drifted through the city like fog. Any survivors who might once have been lingering within the quarantine zone had surely fallen prey to the zombies by now, or had joined their numbers. Aside from the Resurrectionist stronghold, rumored to be somewhere deep underground, safe from the gas and the dead, London belonged to the dead. It was a Resurrectionist experiment gone horribly wrong, and word had reached the Dreadful crew that the Resurrectionists had unleashed another experiment. Jonathan’s face paled as he considered Kasumi’s point.
“I suspect you’re right. How did it go, by the way?”
“Never gets easier,” Kasumi replied. “Had to put down one of the living. A boy. He’d been bitten.”
This was nothing new, but Jonathan’s eyes softened. He’d had to do the same himself more than once. Kasumi was right. It never got any easier taking a life. It was one thing to kill a zombie. Jonathan could do that without a second thought. Killing the living though, that was different. Jonathan remembered a time when he’d hesitated to make the hard choice to pull the trigger, and it had cost the life of a fellow soldier. Sometimes killing was necessary. He knew that. Then again, sometimes it wasn’t. “He might have been immune. You didn’t wait to find out?”
“Trust me, he wasn’t. He was already beginning to turn.”
Jonathan pocketed his telescope and put a hand on Kasumi’s shoulder. “You did well, Kas,” he told her.
She snorted and shrugged his hand away. “No disrespect, Captain, but I don’t need you to tell me that. I know how I did.”
Jonathan nodded. Should have known better than to try to console Kasumi. The girl was even more hot-headed than Annabel. Couldn’t take a compliment if it would save her life.
“We’re in for a spot of turbulence,” Ollie called from his post at the helm. Oliver Lockwood was Jonathan’s pilot and had worked for Thomas Grimmer before Jonathan inherited the ship. Jonathan had come to rely upon his expertise as a pilot and to regard him as a dear friend. “Suggest you two take shelter inside. Miss Hattori, we could use your expertise in the engine room. Been having a bit of trouble with the pressure gauge. Could use your eyes on it.”
“Aye, sir,” Kas said. With a smart salute, she turned and headed through the hatch.
Jonathan followed with a hasty word of thanks that was lost in the wind. He followed Kas into the cabin and, as was his habit, continued on into the lounge. The lounge, which housed a fully stocked bar and employed an expert barman, began to rattle violently.
Ollie’s voice, thin and distorted, came through the speaking tubes which ran throughout the ship. “This is your pilot speaking. We are experiencing some turbulence. Nothing to worry about, but please return to your seats or find something to hold on to.”
“Glass of whiskey, if you please, George?” Jonathan said to the barman. He clutched the countertop as it shook, and tried to appear as if he was not about to vomit.
The barman, for his part, had steady hands, which he proved by managing to pour Jonathan's drink without spilling even the slightest drop.
“Much obliged,” said Jonathan, taking the drink and heading for a seat.
Kas had already disappeared down the hall toward the engine room, so Jonathan was left to his own thoughts. He downed the drink in one swallow, and allowed his thoughts to wander. Not for the first time, he thought of Annabel. Where was she now, he wondered.</Text>
            <Comments>Hoist’ = to raise. 
Cried Captain Merrick’  is technically okay but sounds weak.  I’ve never met this character.  Would he give the order as a cry?  Or would he bellow, or shout, or roar?  Let me know something about him just by the way he transmits his orders. 
Are they sails or wings?   Or are they being generically called ‘sails’ because it’s a ship, even though they’re actually wings.  (Or are there both???)
-- I missed that order—or did the airship adjust its own course?  Orders are a good place to add dialogue and let people get to know your characters. 
“It can’t have gone too much further outside the city,” said Jonathan Grimmer, clutching the railing with white knuckles and peering through a handheld telescope. After several years of expeditions aboard the airship, Jonathan still felt that sickening gut-wrenching vertigo whenever he flew. 
 
-- Good character note, but the moment you mention ‘white-knuckles on the railing’, I envision both hands.  Then when he’s peering through a telescope, I wonder how he’s holding it.
-- I liked this, but you may want to use her full name or, at least, Kasumi, as this is an intro. 
where is she headed, to the cabin or the engine room?
I think it could be tightened up a bit by putting in some more of Grimmer. The opening reads more like a screenplay than a novel to me because it is far more concerned with setting a scene rather than introducing a character. As a reader, such as opening usually indicates to me a weak narrative. I'd rather see this all through Grimmer's senses and get his reaction to what he's experiencing.
As a reader, I never really did connect with any of the characters in this chapter. I understand that most readers will be bringing their relationships with them from the previous book, but as a new reader, they all felt very distant to me. Personally, I'd like to see some more reaction from them. For example, Grimmer shudders when thinking of the possibility of their prey being a Resurrectionist experiment, but as a new reader, I don't know why this possibility should elicit such a reaction. However, a bit later, when Grimmer is talking with Kass about putting the boy down, his reaction is very flat, and it makes him seem a little inhuman to me. I like that Kass has a reaction, but she's not the focal character.

            <Title>Annabel tore down the pier</Title>
            <Text>Annabel tore down the pier, pushing people out of her way as the enormous zombified insect let loose another inhuman screech. It flew low to the ground, and as it approached, Annabel began to make out details. The creature was not entirely organic. As with her mechanical arm and clockwork eye, metal fused with flesh to make a creature that was part machine, part animal. There were men sitting inside it behind thick panes of glass. There were portholes along the insect’s sides, like those on a ship. The men were Resurrectionists by the look of them; they wore plague masks on their faces. She didn’t flatter herself that they were here for her. She was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.
She reached the end of the pier and dove beneath the cover of the harbormaster’s shack, just as the Resurrectionists opened fire. Annabel heard screams beneath the rapid rap-rap-rap of bullet fire. An onslaught of bullets ripped through flesh as men, women, and children were mercilessly gunned down. She turned and saw Bill running to join her behind the shack. It was hardly sufficient cover. Bullets continued to rain down from above, ripping apart everything in their path.
Bill wore a look of horror on his face. He was wide-eyed, pale, his eyes attempting to follow the barrage of bullet fire and wincing as he watched his fellow dockworkers dying. Annabel figured she’d seen worse. She’d seen London fall.
“We’ve got to stop them,” she said, shouting to be heard over the din. “Ye’ve gotta get a hold o’ yourself.”
“They’re killin’ everyone,” he shouted back. “Why? Why would they do that?”
“’Cause they’re insane, Bill,” she answered simply.
Tears began to well up in the man’s eyes. He turned back to the pier, muttering, “I’ve got to help them.”
Annabel stopped him. “Ye tryin’ to get yerself killed?” she barked. “You can’t go out that way.”
She ducked as a bullet pinged off the metal roof of the shack. Bodies began to pile up on the pier and along the shore.
“Are you armed?”
Bill shook his head. Annabel swore. Without some sort of weapon, there was nothing Annabel could do but stand there cowering behind cover. She wanted to fight back.
“I’ve got a gun in me room up the street,” she said. “I’m gonna make a run for it. You can either come with me or—”
Her words were cut short by the sound of cannon fire. She risked a look beyond the shelter of the harbormaster’s shack. The Resurrectionist airship was no longer facing the civilians on the ground. It had turned around to point its weapons at another airship. This ship was familiar to Annabel.
“Is that—” she began. Then she saw the letters painted on the ship’s blimp and realized it was. Penny Dreadful.
Jonathan, she thought. She turned to Bill.
“Go,” she said, pointing at the wounded bodies on the pier. “Help them.”
“What about you?” he asked before turning away.
“I’m going to help them.”
She gestured to the airship in the sky. It was taking heavy fire from the insect ship. If she didn’t help them, they’d go up in flames. She wasn’t sure how she could help, but she had to try something. Bill nodded and took off with another word. Annabel did the same, tearing off in the opposite direction.</Text>
            <Comments>(What sort of masks?  Bio masks?  Costume masks?  Let us know)
(End of Annabel in this chapter.  I suggest you toss in another scrap near to the end of her searching for a weapon or helping the wounded or something simple/dramatic to tie the beginning and end of the chapter together.  From her position on the ground she can look up and react to the on-going battle.)</Comments>

            <Text>“I was still new to my profession. Until very recently I’d been picking pockets and stealing things that were of very little worth to anyone. That all changed when I met a man who wanted to steal something more valuable. His name—when I met him—was Jack Bernhardt. I had met him previously, and he had been kind to me. I began to see him more regularly, and he would occasionally buy me lunch. Sometimes, he would bring me a clean dress or a new hat. Simple enough presents that might not have meant much at all to an ordinary person, but I was a street girl. An orphan. To me, it meant the world. I came to think of him like an older brother. He looked out for me, and he asked nothing in return. So, when at last he did ask something of me, you can imagine my answer.”
“What did he want you to steal?” Jonathan asked.
“Research.”
“Why? What sort of research?” asked Mr. Palmer.
“Bernhardt was a doctor. A physician. Although he was somewhat of a Jack of all trades—no pun intended. Eventually I learned that he had been conducting scientific experiments—of all sorts. He also enjoyed tinkering with rather whimsical inventions. Clockwork dolls and such things. He was something of a genius, and had apparently been a child prodigy, too. According to some of his friends, who I met through my association with him, he never spent a single day in school. I’m not sure if that’s true, but that’s what they said. He learned it all from books, and from his mentor. But his real talent was people. He understood people, was quick to recognize their talents and their weaknesses, and to apply their strengths to his own ends. He often collaborated with other scientists, or hired them to work on his projects. And when others refused to work for him, he would use me.”</Text>

            <Synopsis>Jonathan follows his mother to his father’s office and finds a secret elevator. Annabel surprises him, and he decides to bring her with him, down into the basement. As the elevator descends, they kiss.</Synopsis>
            <Text>After sending Mr. Lockwood to visit Parson Sinews in prison, he’d wanted to pay a visit to the other attendants of the Vigilance Committee, but they’d parted with the understanding that another meeting would soon follow. Therefore no addresses had been exchanged, and while Captain Merrick’s knowledge of the city was vast, he couldn’t be expected to know everyone in London.
Locating Edward Steen or Marianne Hatton proved impossible. Tidkins’ name was obviously a pseudonym, which left only Parson Sinews and Henry Charles Ocelot. He’d already spoken to Ocelot and was reluctant to bother him again so soon, and Parson Sinews’ whereabouts remained unknown.
So Jonathan had returned home for a bit of sleep, and when he’d found that sleep would not come without horrid nightmares that left him breathless, he’d called for a hansom to take him to the Printing Company.
Now, Jonathan paused to stand before a long, winding driveway, which led the way through several neatly planted evergreens and a well-tended garden of chrysanthemums, rhododendrons, and hyacinths, towards a huge building of red brick. The entrance to the driveway was marked by a wooden sign, which hung smartly from a tall signpost. Grimmer and Sons Printing Company, it read in a plain font carved into the wood. Grimmer and Sons was the publisher of a number of literary magazines and newspapers, their most successful enterprise being the penny dreadfuls they published.
Jonathan made his way up the driveway to the entrance of the building, an unimaginatively decorated structure of brick, square and impressive only insofar as it was large.
As the hansom pulled out of the driveway, Jonathan climbed the small flight of stairs and stepped through a tall, white door. 
The almost-musical clang of the printing press resonated down the hall, signalling that the day’s operations had already begun. Jonathan swept through the lobby, giving a brusque nod to the receptionist as he headed into the hallway.
A familiar voice resonated as he rounded the corner. Jonathan’s mother, Mrs. Grimmer, was still part owner of the company, and worked as its financier. But she was not discussing finance.
“- Lord Connor,” Jonathan heard.
Whatever else she was saying, it was drowned out by the mechanical thrum of the printing machines. But that single name was enough to capture his attention. He hurried down the hall to catch up. Her voice began to grow louder; she wasn’t moving away from him, as he’d thought, but towards him. Judging by the sound of her voice, she was about to round the corner. He ducked into an alcove, just as she did, and her voice became more clear.
“They’re leaning hard on all the newspapers, not just the Weekly Gazette,” someone was saying, “If we go public with the truth, we’ll blow our cover.”
“So what are we supposed to do? Just keep quiet? You and I both know that Dr. Allen was not arrested,” Mrs. Grimmer replied in hushed tones.
Her voice was getting closer. Jonathan backed as far into the alcove as space would allow. He hated to be caught eavesdropping, but she was headed his way.
“You know this stinks of The Resurrectionists,” she continued.
Suddenly her voice stopped, as if she’d realised her conversation was being overheard.
Jonathan took a breath. He waited, but the conversation did not resume. Ten seconds, fifteen, twenty. He stepped out of the alcove. His mother was gone, as was her accomplice. They must have disappeared into one of the offices along this hallway, he realised.
He hurried down the hall, guessing which one they might have gone in. He had a strong idea of which one it might be. He came to a halt before a door of solid oak with a brass nameplate. Charles Grimmer, Director.
He opened the door and was surprised to see that the office was deserted. The lamps were lit, however, and it was clear that someone had been in here. He stepped inside and shut the door, his mouth wide.
He’d been in this office at least a dozen times since his father’s death, and countless times before that. But now there was a wide gap in the floor where a red and gold carpet normally lay, and a tall structure of steel and brass rose up out of it.
“What on god’s green earth?” he muttered.
A tall metal cage, cylindrical, with the missing section of the floor as its roof, beneath which was a dark shaft that must have led to the building’s basement. A cable ran down the shaft from the top of the metal cage, seeming to operate on a pulley system. The cable was running even now, the pulley revolving as the machine worked.
He could hear the sound, loud even against the din of the printing press from down the hall, of enormous gears turning from somewhere well below. It was almost like the sound of a clock tower, or the turning wheels of a locomotive. The mechanical clang of an enormous machine in operation.
“A secret elevator,” he realised, even as it descended.
The metal cage disappeared into the floor, filling the missing section of the floor with a hiss of air. The crease in the floor was just barely visible, and only then because Jonathan knew what to look for.
He put his hands on the floor, running them along the length of the crease. There was no latch, no dial, nothing to indicate how to turn the elevator on.
He looked around the room. There had to be a switch somewhere, even it was hidden. He scrutinized his father’s old office, exploring each inch first with his eyes and then with his hands, picking up this item and putting it down, then picking up that item, looking behind it and putting it back where he’d found it again. He was beginning to think that he’d imagined the elevator, but no, there was the crease in the floor where it was hidden. But where in the blazes was the switch? He growled in frustration, fruitlessly picking up books in order to check the wall behind the panel, just as one book suddenly stood out.
A Penny Dreadful publication called Tales of Dead London. Its author was unnamed. If Jonathan recalled correctly, it had originally been published serially, each issue appearing in a periodical magazine, with a number of different writers continuing to write the stories after its original author passed away. Later, the stories were collected and reprinted in a thick paperback volume of nearly four hundred pages.
Unusually, most of the books on the shelf had been collecting dust. The air was filled with dust, now that Jonathan had disturbed the books. But Tales of Dead London was not the least bit dusty. Which meant that unless it had only recently been added to his father’s library, the book had recently been handled. Jonathan picked it up now. As he did, the heavy mechanical sound of revolving gears and gyrating pulleys announced that the elevator had started up again.
He looked to see the floor begin to separate once more, the hidden panel lifting up to reveal the hidden cage into which the elevator would soon rise. In his hand, the book refused to lift from the shelf. It was affixed to the shelf, connected to a lever with little brass screws sticking into its spine. The book was no book at all. It wasn’t even made of paper, he realized with surprise.
Finally, the elevator finished its ascent, and Jonathan let go of the book. It snapped back into place with a slight clicking sound.
Jonathan opened the door of the cage, and stepped nervously into the elevator. He looked around the inside of the cage for some sort of lever that would operate the machine, and eventually found it. He reached up to pull the switch, just as the office door swung open.

A red-haired woman stepped into the office. She closed the door behind her and swaggered across the room, her dress swishing noisily, until she stood face to face with Jonathan. Pretty, but dreadfully disfigured on one side of her face, the woman wore a clockwork monocle on her right side, a long thin scar running down her cheek. She wore a white blouse and black gloves trimmed with lace, and a dark green skirt. There was something incredibly familiar about her, but Jonathan couldn’t think who she might be. He quickly tried to think of an explanation for what he was doing in a cage in his father’s office.
“Mr. O,” said the woman.
He felt the breath knocked out of him. There was only one person who would know him by that name.
“Mr. Monday,” he breathed.
“Miss Monday,” she replied, with a grin.
“Yes, I see that. Since when are you a woman?”
“My whole life,” she replied, not without humour. “I was wearing a disguise when we met. I apologize for the deception, but I felt it was necessary.”
“Some disguise,” he remarked honestly. “How did you find me?”
“I told you. You really have no concept of clandestine operations. Your airship has the name of your company printed right on it.”
He sighed. Splendid. He might as well have given the assassin his calling card and left his front door open while he slept.
“Are you here to kill me?” he asked. “Might as well get it over with. I’m unarmed.”
She rolled her eyes. There was a whir of gears from her right, as the ocular device rotated.
“Didn’t I tell you I’m not an assassin? I’m not here to kill you.”
“No?” Jonathan raised an eyebrow. “Then what do you want with me?”
The lady assassin was equally suspicious.
“What is this?” she demanded, indicating the elevator. “Why don’t you come out of there so we can talk?”
Jonathan opened the door of the cage. He was about to step out, when he thought better of it.
“I’ve got a better idea,” he said.
He pressed his back up against the cage in order to make room for Miss Monday to enter. There was hardly enough space for the two of them, but she squeezed herself inside, and allowed him to close the gate behind her.
She looked at him with suspicion in her eyes. He had the unnerving feeling that she was somehow looking through him, with that monocle of hers. Its gears rotated and its lens telescoped forward, aiming in his direction. At last, the lens retracted, and she stepped inside. She let him close the gate.

He pulled a lever, and Miss Monday gave a start as the elevator shuddered and began to descend. There was a ratcheting sound from above and a thunderous boom from deep below.
“You were right. Lord Connor was a Resurrectionist. You remember how I said that Connor was sick, by the way? I figured out what with.”
Jonathan raised an eyebrow.
“Yes?”
“It’s a virus,” she said. “It’s called Lazarus.”
Jonathan frowned. This was news to him. Even Sinews hadn’t mentioned anything about Lazarus. He had to hand it to her. The woman was resourceful.
“The crow-faced men, Resurrectionists as well, I presume—they took whatever was in Connor’s safe. They were the ones that hired me, but it was a setup. Bastards knew Connor was infected, probably infected him themselves. Said they hoped I’d be infected too. They tried to intimidate me. I refuse to be intimidated.”
“Very good,” Jonathan encouraged. “Give them what for. Just leave me out of it.”
“Leave you out of it, Mr. O? I hate to tell you this, but in case you hadn’t noticed, you’re already in it. You’re in it deep.”
Jonathan sighed.
“I know,” he admitted.
But he was in over his head. He’d just wanted to catch the man who’d killed his father. Perhaps he should have just left that to the police. Miss Monday was right. He wasn’t cut out for all the cloak and dagger.
“Listen, I intend to learn everything I can about the Resurrectionists and take these bastards down. I need your help.”
“You—what?” Jonathan stammered. “Take them down?”
“Remember, my entire livelihood is at stake. These Resurrectionists, in betraying me, have sullied my reputation as a professional.”
“Your…reputation? You’re a criminal!” Jonathan protested.
“I need your help,” she repeated, holding on to the sides of the elevator for balance.
Jonathan swallowed.
“Alright,” he said cautiously, “What you said before, when we first met. We’re in this together. You’ll understand if I’m not interested in saving your reputation as a thief, I’m sure, but I share your goal of uncovering information on the Resurrectionists. Can I ask you something?”
It seemed as if the floor was rising, moving up with surprising speed with the grating sound of grinding metal and slowly revolving gears. Miss Monday nodded.
“Why were you dressed as a gentleman?”
She snorted.
“Never mind that. What are we doing? What’s down there? What does this have to do with them?”
“That’s what I want to find out,” Jonathan replied.
As the elevator shuddered and rattled and the floor continued to rise, he told her about his escape from Connor’s mansion, about his meeting with the Vigilance Committee and the arrest of the false Dr. Allen. And finally, his discovery of the secret elevator. Throughout his explanation, she glared at him as if she thought he was full of crap. Not that he blamed her. Even he found his story hard to swallow, and he’d lived it.
“I knew it was too good to be true,” she said at last.
“What was?”
“I read an article in the newspaper that mentioned Dr. Allen’s arrest,” she told him.
“Which paper?” he asked.
“The Weekly Gazette,” she answered.
One of the Grimmer Company’s newspapers.
“Why do you ask?”
“Just something my mother said,” he answered vaguely.
The floor rose up above their heads, and they plunged into near darkness, the only light being the gas lantern above their heads, and it suddenly seemed as if they were descending into Hell. All that they could see was the cage-like walls of the elevator, and the machinery of its workings, which propelled them downward, toward the basement.
She put her arms on him, for balance, as the floor rattled beneath them, and he caught her. She leaned into his embrace, and though they were descending into the basement, he felt himself growing warmer. He put his hand against the back of her neck, leaned in close, and let his lips linger half an inch from hers.
After a moment, she leaned in and pressed her mouth against his. Her lips were warm, and soft, but she kissed him roughly. He kissed her clumsily, fumbling as he put his arms around her waist.</Text>
            <Comments>It may be necessary to delete this bit; may remove the Vigilance Committee plot in favour of an intimate meeting between Jonathan and Sinews.
Was Jonathan not concerned about the police or the resurectionists coming to his home?
Is Mrs.  Grimmer talking about the cover of the publishing company or was she meant to say “we’ll blow their cover.”?
I like having a book trigger the secret elevator.  It’s a cliche, sure, but it’s one of the best.  I’ve even used it, myself, right down to the clue of the book in question being less dusty.
- P. Aloysius Regnad
Would she be shocked to see the elevator?  I would indicate that Jonathan saw this as she addressed him.
This feels rather random.  There was no real buildup of attraction between these two characters to have the kiss seem natural and not forced.</Comments>
            <Notes>“The Grimmer Company owns that paper,” he told her. “My mother, she said something about wanting to print the true story, but she was concerned it would blow her cover. She might not be with the Resurrectionists at all. I think she might be working against them, from the inside.”

To Jonathan it seemed as if everything had started with his father’s letter.
“Dear Jonathan,” he’d said. “There’s not sufficient time for me to tell you everything, so I’ll say just this. Lord Henry Connor is dangerous.”
The rest of the letter was illegible, and it was clear that it was not finished. But if it had not been for that short letter from his father, he would not have paid such close attention to Lord Connor’s letter when sorting through his father’s office. If he’d not scrutinized that so closely, he would not have noted the matching penmanship with Francis Varney’s letter, and were it not for those letters, he would never have attended Lord Connor’s party, never met Mr. Monday. Never ventured to attended Mr. Sinews’ Vigilance Committee meeting, never witnessed his arrest. One event led to another. But now Jonathan had come full circle.</Notes>

“This prison,” he said, thinking aloud, “It can’t stay airborne forever, can it? Occasionally they’ll have to land somewhere for fuel and supplies and to keep the balloons full of hydrogen.”
“Of course,” said the priest, “You are right about that. But if you’re thinking that the best time to escape is when the ship is aground, I’m afraid you may be mistaken. The security is relaxed when we’re in the sky, because the guards know as well as we do, that even if you do escape your cell, there’s nowhere for you to go. But when we land, that’s when you’ll see a change in the guards, not just in their number, but also in the seriousness with which they take their jobs. No, your best chance of escape is when we’re airborne.”
“And what?” said Mr. Sinews, “Just fly out of here? Like a bird, I’ll simply flap my way down?”
“Something like that,” said the priest.
“Alright, Daedalus,” he replied. “We’ll just build ourselves a pair of wings and stick them to our backs with candle wax.” Mr. Sinews grinned. “Once again, living up to your name, Priest.”
“You mock,” said the priest, “But what if it could be done? Wouldn’t it be worth trying?”
“Yes,” Mr. Sinews consented.
“So,” said the priest, “As I said, it will take time and preparation. First, we’ll need to get our hands on the appropriate supplies.”
“And how will we do that?”
The priest winked, knowingly. “The guards are not all without religious affiliation. They bring me whatever supplies they can get away with bringing me. I absolve them of sin.”
Mr. Sinews returned the priest’s grin.
“And in the meantime,” said Faria, “I have books and wisdom to offer you, my friend.”
“I’m not sure about the books,” said Mr. Sinews, “But I could certainly do with some wisdom.”</Text>

            <Synopsis>The Moirae bind and gag Roderick and take him for a ride in their carriage. Then they let him go and drive off.</Synopsis>
            <Text>It would hardly have surprised anyone if Mr. Steen were to claim that vampires were real. If anything, his scepticism was surprising. Most people believed in them. Ghosts, vampires, werewolves. What reason did anyone have to doubt their existence? Really, it was only the upper classes and the highly educated that doubted such things, and Roderick was middle class at best.
His father had been a policeman, and an alcoholic. Edward Steen had made a decent salary as a detective at Scotland Yard, in spite of his inability to refuse a glass of whiskey when one was proffered. He’d retired young, if retirement was the right word. The truth was that he’d drank himself out of a job. He still pursued a career as a detective, but as a consultant for hire, not entirely unlike Roderick. Roderick hadn’t seen his father in years, and almost never thought about him.
Edward Steen was superstitious. He believed that murderers were possessed by devils, that sin was a gateway for demons to cross over into our world. Perhaps that was exactly why Roderick was so steadfastly logical. Perhaps this was also why he never let a drop of liquor touch his lips. Edward Steen had also always preferred cats to dogs.
But then, suppose an irrefutable fact presented itself, one which made superstition more logical than superstition. If truth must prevail, then Roderick was forced to consider that even myths have a foundation in truth.
In short, there was every possibility that the men in the alley were vampires. The notion was unsettling, even if the conclusion was entirely logical in light of the evidence. Still, the women in the Tea House presented an even greater unknown. And that unknown element was more frightening than the known.
But Roderick had wanted to wait for the opportune moment to make his exit. He’d hoped to leave without alerting them to his intention to flee, to run when they weren’t expecting him to do so. No such opportunity had presented itself, however, and so it seemed he’d squandered his chance. While they’d played their role as gracious hosts, offering him tea and information as if he was any ordinary customer who’d wandered into their Tea House, he’d known from the first moment he’d laid eyes on the spiders crawling on Clotho’s skin, that they would never let him leave voluntarily.
Now, his arms and legs were bound, his mouth gagged, his eyes blindfolded. They’d taken Bailey from him, or so he guessed, as he could no longer hear his companion’s breath or feel his soft fur brushing up against his leg. Then they’d dragged him outside.
With his eyes blindfolded, the only thing he could do was force himself to keep his breathing calm and quiet so he could listen for the dreadful moans of the undead. But the streets had gone quiet. Something had drawn the ghouls away.
He could hear the clopping sound of horses, and the rolling wheels of a carriage moving slowly along the cobblestone. It rolled to a stop, and one of the doors was pulled open. A Brougham carriage, he guessed, judging by the number of horses that pulled it, and by the distinctive sound of glass windows, which rattled when the door swung open.
He felt half a dozen hands, grabbing him. He was hoisted up, tossed roughly into the car. The strength of the hags was surprising. He landed uncomfortably, with his arms behind his back, his face slamming hard into the floor of the carriage. The door shut, and he tried to manoeuvre himself into a more manageable position, grunting with the effort.
The awful taste of the gag in his mouth, the rough cloth upon his tongue, made him turn more violently. He strained against his bonds, tried to wiggle in the tight space on the floor between the seats, until he could sit up. He picked at the knots that bound his hands. To no avail. He couldn’t undo the knots. The rope was thick, and as sticky as spiderwebs. He could not even manage to get into a sitting position. Eventually he realised that his struggles were only making things worse.
He was beginning to hyperventilate, breathing mostly through his nose, due to the gag in his mouth. The worst thing about it all though was the absence of his canine companion.
He ought to be embarrassed. Captured by a gang of old women. But he’d foolishly left the house without a firearm or even a pocket knife. For all his brilliance as a detective, he could be truly thick sometimes. But he was getting nowhere by scolding himself. He had to remain focused if he was going to get out of this somehow.
Two of the sisters sat on the rear-facing seat bench. This Roderick ascertained, or guessed rather, by sound alone. There was the most unusual noise coming from one of the sister’s robes. It might have been that his ears deceived him. He was disoriented, after all, by the blindfold over his eyes and the gag in his mouth. But he thought he heard the sound of hissing.
Lachesis then, he concluded, by process of elimination. He still had no idea what pets she kept beneath her robes, but it was neither spiders nor moths. And when he felt the disturbing itch of a spider crawling on his flesh, he knew that Clotho had taken the seat beside her. Which meant that Atropos must have taken the driver’s seat outside the cab. She cracked the whip, and the horse began to move.
He had a million questions burning in his mind. Where were they headed? What had they done with Bailey? What were they going to do to him? If they were planning to kill him, why had they not simply done so already? If they were in league with the Resurrectionsts, why had they denied it? They had no reason to lie. But with the gag over his mouth, he was forced to keep his silence.
“You’re wondering if we’re going to kill you,” said Clotho, as if reading his mind.
Already he’d learned to tell their voices apart. Though there was a similar rasp and a wheezing breathiness in each of the sister’s voices, Clotho spoke in the excited, rushed cadence of a young child, while Atropos spoke in a weary, bitter-sounding voice. Their was a coldness in her tone. Lachesis, meanwhile, had yet to utter a word, so he knew her by her silence.
“We’re not the villains here,” she said. Just as he was beginning to think she was a mute.
Roderick might have laughed, if not for the gag in his mouth. No, they’d taken his dog, kidnapped him, and were obviously collaborating with the Resurrectionists, but they were not the villains.
“I know how that must sound,” she said. “But we aren’t going to kill you. We just want you to stay on your path.”
“Shall I tell him?” whispered Clotho, excitement in her voice.
He heard Atropos’ voice from outside, rising above the wind and the rattling of the carriage. “Don’t,” she said. “Don’t you dare.”
How she’d heard Clotho’s quiet whisper from outside, Roderick couldn’t say, but Clotho merely laughed, delighted to have been overheard. Her whispered voice grew even quieter, so that even Roderick could barely hear her over the hissing sound of Lachesis’ robes. “Shall I tell him how he’ll die?”
The question hung in the air, unanswered, but Roderick could imagine that a silent conversation was taking place, the sort of words that could be spoken with a familiar look between sisters. Eventually, Clotho relented. “Oh, you’re no fun,” she said. “Well, Mr. Steen, it’s been a pleasure.”
The carriage rolled to a stop. A moment later, he heard the swishing rustle of cloth and the sound of footsteps on paving stones. The door swung open, and the blindfold was ripped from Roderick’s face.
Atropos stood before him, Bailey squirming in her arms. He took a moment to look around. The street was familiar.
Lachesis and Clotho climbed out of the carriage, and with the assistance of their black-clad sister, roughly ejected Roderick from the car. While Clotho bent down to loosen the knots that bound his ankles, Atropos set Bailey on the ground. He yipped happily, jumping up and slobbering on his master.
The moirae climbed back into the carriage, and with the crack of a whip, they were gone. Once Roderick had managed to work the ropes free from his hands, he was at last able to remove his gag.
“Well, that was strange,” he said.</Text>

        <Document ID="307">
            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>While Mr. O had arrived by way of airship, he had taken a bicycle with him, and had ridden that through the park after disembarking. Being averse to air travel, Miss Monday agreed to accompany him on foot, while he rolled the bicycle alongside as he walked. As absurd a device as it seemed, Miss Monday had to admit that the bicycle did have some advantages in its favour; for one, it wasn’t likely to defecate upon the street, like a horse. No need to feed it either. No worry about it getting sick, or tired. It would never be spooked and buck its passenger from its back.
Still, Miss Monday had heard that its seats were rigid and uncomfortable and that riding upon it was about as pleasant as lying on a bed of nails. She’d heard the term bone-shaker being bandied about, referring to the unpleasantness of riding the contraption. Of course, she’d never ridden one herself, so she would have to reserve her judgment until then. At least it must be better than riding in an airship, she thought.
Of course, the novelty of Mr. O’s shiny, brightly painted bicycle was only enough to distract Miss Monday for so long. Soon enough, her thoughts returned to Mr. O’s claim that her life was being threatened by a secret society that was targeting those with some connection to the unliving.
“Why me?” she said aloud.
“As I said before, I was impressed by your resourcefulness and your cleverness, and of course by your rather unusual resume. To be honest, I’d had my eyes on you even before our chance encounter at Lord Connor’s manor. And of course, I could not ignore the fact that you have been targeted by the Society.”
She blinked at this, startled by the revelation that she’d been under his watchful eye for longer than she’d realised. His network of information must have gone well beyond what she’d initially imagined; she ought to have been a phantom, a wisp drifting in the corner of one’s eye, a shadow moving unnoticed through the criminal underground, elusive and untraceable as the wind. To most, that’s what she was.
Still, “That’s not what I meant,” she said. “I meant why are they targeting me? In my experience—”
“People tend to be targeted when they possess knowledge they ought not to have,” he finished.
She nodded, pausing at the corner of the street, as they made their way out of Hyde Park. A few cabriolets went by, rolling quickly along the street, some of them turning toward the park. When the road was clear, she followed Mr. O across the street.
“I’m not sure why you’ve been targeted,” he said when they had crossed the street. He beckoned her to follow, as he headed east along the sidewalk. “But I suspect we will find out, in due time. You’re sure there isn’t something you’re keeping from me? Something to do with your ocular prosthesis, perhaps?”
She glared at him. “Nothing like that.”
“In that case,, it is likely a case of misinformation. They probably believe you know something they don’t want you to know.”
She hurried to keep up with his surprisingly quick pace, which he maintained in spite of the bicycle at his side.
“Still, I wonder…” he said, scratching his forehead thoughtfully. Eventually, he shrugged. “Hm. Never mind,” he said.
With that, Miss Monday fell silent as well. They navigated the streets of London, taciturn but deep in thought. They passed a few familiar landmarks as they followed Mr. O’s meandering route through London—the Royal Academy, a church, an inn, a pub, an entrance to the London underground—and Miss Monday began to wonder where he was taking her. Her feet began to tire.
“Too bad you didn’t bring an extra bicycle,” she said at last, breaking the silence.
He grinned. “I was under the impression that you weren’t a fan.”
“I’m not,” she admitted, with a hint of a smile playing on her lips. “Can I ask you something?”
He shrugged. “Ask away,” he said. “I’m an open book.”
“What does the ‘O’ stand for?”
He paused, mid-step, and stood stock-still. He tried to pass the gesture off as casual, as though he’d paused to avoid a crack in the sidewalk, but it was too late, as Miss Monday had already noticed it. Apparently the question had caught him off guard.
“Oliver,” he said, summoning up his customary nonchalance which bordered on arrogance. “John Oliver.”
She nodded silently, but she wasn’t quite sure she believed him. Barely a moment later, her doubts were confirmed, as they arrived at their destination.
Mr. O paused to stand before a long, winding driveway, which led the way through several neatly planted evergreens and a well-tended garden of chrysanthemums, rhododendrons, and hyacinths, towards a huge building of red brick. The entrance to the driveway was marked by a wooden sign, which hung smartly from a tall signpost. Grimmer and Sons Literary Agency and Printing Press, it read in a plain font, which was engraved into the wood.
“Family business,” said Mr. O with a wink and a smile.
The made their way up the driveway to the entrance of the building, an unimaginatively decorated structure made almost entirely of brick, square and impressive only insofar as it was large and boasted great square windows through which Miss Monday could glimpse the bustling activity of the Grimmer family’s printing company.
Another sign in the window bore the name of the company and the building’s address.
Mr. O parked his bicycle against the wall, and headed up a small flight of stairs, which led to a tall, white door. A bell tinkled musically as he opened the front door and held it open with a gallant sweep of his hand, gesturing for Miss Monday to head inside. She hesitated momentarily upon the steps.
“Family business?” she repeated, sarcastically, “I thought your family were the Oliver’s.”
Some open book he was, she thought disdainfully.
“Ah, well, no,” he said with a noncommittal shrug. “John Oliver Grimmer,” he said as if introducing himself for the first time.
She raised an eyebrow, expressing her doubt, but she swept through the doorway nonetheless.
Immediately she was overwhelmed by the sounds of the bustling employees of Grimmer &amp; Sons, the mechanical clamour of the printing press from an adjacent room, the clacking of typewriters, and the high-pitched and cheerful voice of the Grimmer Agency’s secretary, who greeted the pair with a smile and a curtsey.
“Hello, Mr. Grimmer,” she said as he followed Miss Monday into the lobby of his family’s business.
“Mrs. Fields,” he said, taking off his hat and hanging it on a rack next to her desk, “I have the distinct pleasure of introducing you to Miss Monday.”
“Very nice to meet you, Miss Monday,” said Mrs. Fields, beaming genuinely from ear to ear. “Will you be working here at the Agency?” she asked, clasping Miss Monday’s hands in her own as if they’d been best friends their entire lives.
Before she could respond, Mr. O interjected. “She is entertaining the idea,” he said. “I thought I would give her a tour, with the hope that seeing the Agency in person might help make up her mind.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene Two</Title>
            <Text>Mrs. Fields nodded enthusiastically, as if to say that she agreed wholeheartedly with Mr. O’s assessment. At last, she released her grip on Miss Monday’s hands, and reiterated how nice it was to have made her acquaintance.
Miss Monday nodded wordlessly, still taking in the sights and sounds of the bustling industry. It was true, that if it were her ambition to work at a printing company or literary agency, she might have found it difficult to refuse a position here. As it was, she hadn’t the slightest idea what she was doing there.
Mr. O led the way down the hall, taking on the role of tour guide as Miss Monday followed him into a room filled with row upon row of typewriters, which clacked noisily beneath the fingers of a dozen men and women. She wondered what they were all typing.
“I’m not quite sure I have the qualifications to work at a printing company,” she jibed.
“Not to worry,” he said, winking conspiratorially, “That’s all just a front for my real business.”
Exiting the room with the typewriters, they entered a long hallway, with doors along the way, each marked by a plaque indicating the name of the gentleman to whom the office belonged.
“Of course, none of them know it’s a front. As far as they’re concerned, the only things we do here are print and publish novels and stories, mainly penny dreadfuls. We also publish a magazine on a quarterly basis, but that’s hardly important. The point is, very few of our own employees are aware of the true nature of the business. And of course, the printing press is profitable; almost all of our expenses are made possible by the money earned by our front business.”
Miss Monday nodded to show that she followed.
“So, the real business…” she said.
“Ah, that,” said Mr. O with a sly smile. He’d paused outside the last door on the left of the hallway, a door marked with his own name and title.
Mr. Jonathan Grimmer, Director
He opened the door and beckoned her to follow him inside. He glanced up and down the hallway as she crossed the threshold into a large but unremarkable office. He shut the door behind them, while she took a moment to survey the small space.
Like most of the rooms in the Agency, it was scarcely decorated, plain and square. A red carpet lined the floor. A wooden desk sat atop the carpet, almost directly centered in the room. The desk was practically bare, as if it had seen little to no use. Miss Monday noted that there were no blotches of ink, no grooves or scratches in the desk, nor any other telltale sign that would suggest the desk had ever been used. The only objects on the desk: a small brass paperweight, an ink well, and a stack of untouched manuscripts. Behind the desk, a leather armchair that appeared to be collecting dust. A tall square window at the far end of the room was covered by a pair of thick, black curtains.
“The real business,” Mr. O announced, as he took a seat at the desk, causing dust to stir up and drift about the room like pale gray snow. He reached down with one hand and grabbed hold of a fixture that Miss Monday was unable to see from her present angle. There was a ratcheting sound as he pulled the lever beneath his desk. He gave her a triumphant smile, and watched as Miss Monday’s mouth fell open.
At the edge of the red carpet, there was a circular groove carved into the hardwood floor, which twisted open. The circular spot on the floor began slowly to rise up out of the floor with the heavy sound of wood grinding against wood.
Miss Monday found herself drawn to the spot on the floor, moving closer almost against her will, in order to see what was happening. Peering into the gap in the floor as the single circular section of the floor continued to rise, she caught flashes of steel and brass.
She could hear the sound, loud even against the din of the printing press from a nearby room they’d yet to explore, of enormous gears turning from somewhere well below them. It was almost like the sound of a clock tower, or the turning wheels of a locomotive. The mechanical clang of an enormous machine coming to life.
“It’s an elevator,” he explained as it rose up to fill the the gap in the floor. The machine was built a bit like a cage, its bars made of brass, a gate on the front, which Mr. O slid open once the elevator came to a halt. A system of toothed wheels on each side of the contraption allowed the elevator to move up or down, pulley-like, with the simple pull of a lever, cleverly hidden beneath Mr. O’s desk.
Miss Monday had heard of elevators, and knew that they were commonly used in mining, but she’d never seen one in person, and never suspected that one could be so easily hidden within the design of a building so that most of the building’s occupants would not even know of its existence.
“So this is how you keep your employees in the dark?” she said, as Mr. O stepped inside the elevator.
He shook his head though he was smiling. “No,” he said, and, ironically, reached up to light the gas lamp that hung from the ceiling of the elevator. “Not really.”
He pressed his back up against the cage in order to make room for Miss Monday to enter. There was hardly enough space for the two of them, but she squeezed herself inside, and allowed him to close the gate behind her.
He pulled a lever, and Miss Monday gave a start as the elevator shuddered and began to descend. It seemed to her as if the floor was rising, moving up with surprising speed with the grating sound of grinding metal and slowly revolving gears.
“Trapdoor and a set of spiral stairs wouldn’t do the trick?” she said with her customarily sarcastic tone as they headed down into the basement.
“Elevator,” he said with a shrug, “Much more stylish.”
Then, the floor rose up above their heads, and they plunged into near darkness, the only light being the gas lantern above their heads, and it suddenly seemed as if they were descending into Hell. All that she could see was the cage-like walls of the elevator, and the machinery of its workings, which propelled them downward, toward the basement.</Text>

            <Title>Annabel headed into Gravesend, past the Three Daws Public House</Title>
            <Text>Annabel headed into Gravesend, past the Three Daws Public House onto High Street. She raced down Crooked Lane, her feet slamming on the uneven paving stones until her knees ached and her lungs burned. The anguished cries of the wounded still reached her as she rounded the corner. She didn’t dare slow down. Cannons boomed. The rapid fire of the insect ship’s machine guns cracked like thunder.
Finally she reached the house she was lodging at. She pounded on the door with her right hand even as she fumbled to find her keys with her left. The door creaked open and the familiar face of her landlady appeared in its frame.
“Oh, thank god! Mrs. Miller!” she said. “I was worried you might’ve been down at the docks.”
“Wot’s goin’ on, girl?” the plump older woman demanded as Annabel pushed past her landlady and headed for her bedroom.
“No time to explain,” Annabel answered.  “Just stay inside until this all dies down.”
She dragged a heavy steamer trunk from under her bed. She didn’t bother with the key, but simply snapped the lock in two with her metal arm, and heaved open the lid. Mrs. Miller’s eyes went wide. The trunk was filled to the brim with weapons.
Annabel took out the crossbow, slung it over her shoulder, and reached back into the trunk. She needed something with enough range and power to hit the airship. She found a rifle she hoped would do the trick, and hurriedly loaded it with heavy ammunition.
She put a hand on her landlady’s shoulder. “Thank you for everything,” she said. “In case I don’t end up back ‘ere, consider this as thanks.”
She slipped her hand into her pocket and pulled out the stolen necklace. Mrs. Miller went wide-eyed. “But that’s…that’s…” she stammered, following Annabel as she hurried out of the room, “that’s worth more than I’ll make in a lifetime! Where did you get this?”
Annabel ignored the question and headed to the door. She turned back to Mrs. Miller one last time.
“I need a vantage point,” she said, holding up the rifle. “Somewhere high up, so I can get a good shot.”
“Well, there’s the clock tower,” the landlady replied, clutching the diamonds to her breast but looking frightened and flustered, “but tell me wot’s goin’ on, girl. You aren’t gonna shoot somebody, are you, love?”
“Goodbye, Mrs. Miller.”
Crossbow over her shoulder, rifle in hand, Annabel headed for the Gravesend Clock Tower. She could see the two airships still battling in the sky, and hear Mrs. Miller still shouting after her. She heard distant cries of pain. She passed a dozen people who were running towards the pier. Some of them tried to stop her to see if she knew what was happening, but she pressed on. She needed to get into the tower. All she could think about was Jonathan Grimmer, up there in the Penny Dreadful.
Finally, she reached the Clock Tower square, and ran toward the tall tower. She hoped it would give her enough of a vantage point to get a decent shot. A narrow maintenance door on one side of the tower was the only point of entry, and it was locked. Annabel turned a dial on her brass arm, and as the gears turned, her lock picking tools extended. There was no such thing as a locked door in Annabel’s world. The lock clicked, and the door swung inward.
It was dark in the narrow stairway, but Annabel grabbed the railing and blindly raced up the stairs. Her boots clanged on the iron staircase. By the dim light from the narrow slits in the tower, she could see there was a maintenance hatch in the ceiling. She figured that would get her access to the roof. It was locked. A moment later, it wasn’t.
She shimmied through the narrow hatch and climbed awkwardly onto the gothic-styled rooftop. A few pigeons flapped their wings and made way for her. Crouching between the arches and the weathervane, she set her crossbow down and readied her rifle.
She looked to the sky and caught sight of the airships. She was surprised to see that the tables seemed to have turned. The Dreadful was pursuing the enemy ship now, and the overgrown insect was headed in her direction. She couldn’t have planned it better. She aimed her rifle and waited for the ship to come closer. As they did, she spied the men inside the bizarre airship. The windshield was shattered, giving her clear access for a shot. She peered through the scope and looked into their masked faces. Resurrectionists.
Her jaw tightened as she ground her teeth. All this time searching for any trace of them, and now, they were headed straight for her. Under ordinary circumstances, she’d have preferred to take them alive. She wanted to question them about Chateau d’If, where she suspected Parson Sinews had been taken, along with Jonathan Grimmer’s mother. However, given that they were piloting a deadly giant insect armed with machine guns, it seemed more prudent to simply take them out. She counted just four of them. They were still one-hundred feet above her, but she believed that was close enough.
She waited, heart racing as they approached. Her fingers itched to pull the trigger. Still she waited. Finally, when the moment was right, she pulled the trigger.
Her first shot was a direct hit. The first Resurrectionist slumped over in his seat, and the others jumped. She grinned, enjoying their panicked reaction. They scrambled to find the shooter, as Annabel readied another shot. One down, she thought, aiming for the next of them. Again she pulled the trigger, and again, she hit her target. Blood painted the interior of the airship.
Suddenly, the two remaining Resurrectionists were pointing in her direction. The ship’s guns began rotating toward her.
“Shit!” she swore.
She needed to take out whichever of them was manning the guns before he had a chance to fire back. She didn’t know which of them was piloting the ship, though, and which was manning the guns. Her odds were fifty-fifty.
She chose her target and fired a third shot. The Resurrectionist fell over backwards, and just as suddenly, the Resurrectionist airship changed direction. The ship wailed, a high-pitched, painful sound. The guns fired, but the shots went wide. She had hit the pilot, she realized. The Resurrectionists were no longer in control of the creature; it was flying autonomously. She aimed her rifle again, but she’d missed her chance. The ship had changed direction too quickly, and she no longer had a clear line to the control room.
The boom of the Penny Dreadful’s cannons reverberated across the square, followed by the massive creature’s horrendous screech. The creature turned on the Dreadful. Its antennae lashed out, crumpling the thin metal shields and puncturing one of the airship’s ballonets. It shrieked, slamming down its massive limbs onto the ship’s gondola, splitting timber. Annabel watched in horror as the airship began to lose altitude and came hurtling down toward the ground much too fast.</Text>

            <Title>The Mad Priest awoke from another strange dream</Title>
            <Text>Three Years Earlier

The Mad Priest awoke from another strange dream, trembling violently with the memory. His head ached as if from a hangover. He was wasting away in this prison, all the meat on his bones turning to thin strips of skin that clung to his frail skeleton like wet rags. There were puncture wounds in his neck, but his memory had blanks. His skull throbbed when he tried to remember the night before. His prison mate terrified him, but he couldn’t say why. It had only been a week since Parson Sinews had moved into the adjacent cell. In that short time, the Mad Priest had begun to die.
He had visions of green ghosts dancing at the edges of his vision, phosphorescent images flitting in his peripheral like faeries. He climbed out of his bed, shaking his head as if to clear the visions. Occasionally, when he looked at Mr. Sinews, he saw wings at his back. Like the broken wings of Lucifer himself, his wings were broad, feathered. His feathers were a green so dark they might have been black. Other times, he saw Sinews as an ordinary man. He began to wonder which was the illusion—the man or the angel.
The memory of his dreams played out in his mind. His dreams were not his own.
He remembered the sound of Parson Sinews’ leather shoes on cobblestone, louder than he might have expected from a man who walked with such grace and poise. The sound echoed in the still night air. The quiet was interrupted only by the dance of shoes on stone, and with that stillness came the sensation that if he were to stop and listen, he would hear nothing but the sound of his own blood pulsing through his veins.
He shrunk back in his cell, remembering the dream as vividly as if he were still asleep. He saw green eyes in the darkness.
Accompanying the rhythm of his footsteps came the tap of Parson’s walking stick. He did not lean heavily upon the cane but used it to accentuate the rhythm of his gait and to disturb the unnerving quiet as much as possible. Of all the things worth enduring, silence did not rank high on Parson’s list. Not merely in the auditory realm, Parson craved the chaotic and the voluminous. This silence disturbed him. The Mad Priest felt Parson’s hatred running through him.
Parson quickened his step, increased the force with which he tapped his cane upon the ground, and abandoned the street in favor of a nearby alley. The alleyway quickly brought him to his fiancé’s residence. He knocked on the door.
“This prison,” said his fellow prisoner, startling him. “It can’t stay airborne forever, can it? Occasionally they’ll have to land somewhere for fuel and supplies and to keep the balloons full of hydrogen.”
Though the priest feared his fellow prisoner, he couldn’t help but respond kindly. He doubted himself more than he doubted his fellow man. His visions were a symptom of his own madness, not proof of his prison mate’s villainy.
“Of course,” he said. “You’re right, although the ship doesn’t land often. It can refuel in mid-air, and it is capable of generating more hydrogen even without landing. It does land, of course, but if you’re thinking that the best time to escape is when the ship is aground, I’m afraid you may be mistaken. The security is relaxed when we’re in the sky, because the guards know as well as we do that even if you do escape your cell, there’s nowhere for you to go. But when we land, that’s when you’ll see a change in the guards, not just in their number, but also in the seriousness with which they take their jobs. No, your best chance of escape is when we’re airborne.”
“And then what? We just fly out of here?”
Why not? You’ve got wings. He almost said it aloud, but instead he kept his mouth shut.
“First things first, we need to get out of our cells. How do we do that?”
“Bonsoir, Rachelle,” he heard Sinews’ voice saying.
At first, he had thought it was Camille at the door. She had the same beautiful auburn eyes and caramel-colored skin, her hair pulled into neat cornrows, just like her sister’s. How the Mad Priest knew that, he didn’t know, but he knew that they looked so much alike that Sinews had often gotten them confused. He knew that Rachelle had found it amusing to play little jokes on him, planting kisses on his cheeks and calling him sweetheart. Sinews had learned to recognize their subtle differences since then. The way Camille held her hand on her hip when she was angry, the way she pouted when she was sad, the uninhibited way she laughed. There were physical differences too, but those were less obvious.
“Où est-elle?” he asked. Where is she?
“Suivez-moi,” Rachelle replied. Her French had the same Haitian accent as her sister’s, but her voice was colder than Camille’s.
He stepped through the threshold of the door, and walked into that familiar household with its smells and sounds that brought memories rushing back violently. The smell of coffee beans from the kitchen. The scent of lemon that always seemed to permeate the hallway for whatever reason. The smell of Camille’s perfume from the stairway.
He did as instructed and followed Camille’s twin up a flight of stairs, then down a dimly lit hallway and into the bedroom.
A wave of nausea struck him like a kick to the gut.
“Priest?”
Pieres shook with the memory of the dream as he returned to the present. He was dying. This prison was killing him. He needed to escape as badly as his fellow prisoner did, but he knew somehow that only one of them would leave Chateau d’If alive.
“How do we get out of our cells?” Sinews demanded.
Camille had a mask sewn to her face made of a jumbled mass of animal and human skin, fur and bone. A pair of dog’s ears replaced her own. Both arms were connected to her shoulders by a system of pistons and winches. The mechanical parts ran straight through her, replacing her skeletal system with machinery. With the grinding of clockwork gears, she raised her arm and waved. The gesture was so delicate, so human, so familiar, that Pieres wanted to gag and choke. He tried to awaken from his reverie, but he couldn’t.
As the grinding of gears continued, she lowered her arm and smiled.
As had been done to her arms, her legs had been altered as well, severed and reattached in the same manner. But it was not merely her own legs that had been sewn back on. She’d gained a few new pairs as well, making her a hideous parody of Arachne. Eight bare legs, each pair different from the other, and each one covered in scars and stitches from thigh to toe. The Mad Priest wondered if this was a memory or a nightmare. Had Sinews really killed this woman or had he just dreamed it? Or was he just mad?
He wanted to look away. He needed to. He felt sick, but still he found himself drawing closer to Camille.
He drew closer still, closer, until he was near enough to touch her. Near enough to look into her eyes. He laid a hand on her face, as gently as he could.
There was a clicking sound, followed by that same grinding of gears, the whirring of mechanical parts, and the nauseating sound of dead flesh creaking as it moved, reanimated by the automaton beneath her skin.
The sound was tinny and unclear, but the voice was hers. “Wake up, Father,” she told him. “You need to wake up.”
His eyes snapped open. He looked into green eyes—and dreamed no more.</Text>

            <Title>Bailey wagged his tail when he recognized the shadowy</Title>
            <Text>Bailey wagged his tail when he recognized the shadowy figure in his master’s studio, and danced circles around the man. Roderick was no less excited to see his familiar face. He put his hands on Parson’s shoulders, looked into his intoxicating green eyes, and kissed him on the lips. Parson grinned. “It’s good to see you, too, Roderick.”
Sébastien coughed awkwardly.
Roderick stepped away from Parson, cheeks reddening. “I’m sorry, how rude of me! Parson Sinews, this is Sébastien Bilodeau, my, er, assistant. Sébastien, Mr. Sinews is an old, well, an old friend…”
Sébastien huffed. “An old friend indeed,” said the younger man, looking Sinews up and down critically.
If he was searching for flaws in Parson’s complexion, he would be hard pressed to find them. Still, Roderick felt that to say anything further would be akin to poking an irritated viper with a stick. Not a good idea. He turned away from Parson and flicked the gas lights back on, illuminating the gory scene that had taken over Roderick’s studio.
The two sisters lay sprawled out on the floor, their throats torn open. Parson’s clothes were stained with blood. Roderick shrunk back in disgust. He looked down at his own clothes and saw that they’d gotten bloody as well. Again, he regretted kissing Parson. It had been years since he’d last seen him, though, and although they’d long since broken off their romantic relationship, it was easy to fall back into old habits. Besides, he’d begun to think he might never see Parson again. After he’d been taken by the Resurrectionists to Chateau d’If…
“You’re the escaped prisoner,” he realized. “They were after you.”
“Yes,” Parson admitted. “I’m sorry for all the trouble they’ve caused you. I’d meant to get to them sooner. I had some difficulty tracking them, especially once I realized…” He stooped over to get a closer look at the women’s faces.
“Realized what?” asked Sébastien, still sulking.
“That they weren’t twins.”
“What do you mean? Of course they are. Look at them. They're identical!”
Parson shook his head. “No,” he said, putting his hand on one of the bodies. He turned her neck to get a closer look at a birth mark that was hidden at the nape of her neck. “This one is Rachelle. Her sister, Camille, and I were engaged to be married,” he said, and he turned to examine the second body, “before I learned that she was a Resurrectionist. Mircalla Karnstein. Carmilla. But this is not Camille. I’ve never seen this one before.”
“There’s a third sister?” Roderick asked, incredulous. “They’re triplets?”
Parson nodded. “Neither one of these bodies is Camille’s,” he said.
There was a layer of menace in his voice, a soft threat that unsettled Roderick. He’d forgotten how dangerous Parson could be. He’d just killed two women in front of Roderick, and although Roderick would be hard pressed to say they didn’t deserve it, he still should have felt unsettled by what he’d just witnessed. Instead, he felt a delirious sense of calm that he knew was brought on by his proximity to Parson. Roderick found Parson’s mere presence intoxicating. Most people did. That was what made him so dangerous.
There was a time when that very danger was what attracted Roderick to Parson. Now, after everything that had happened—the Resurrectionists wiping out London with the zombie virus, having to kill people he cared about in order to stop them from turning into zombies, being imprisoned by the Resurrectionists—danger was the last thing in the world he wanted.
“Camille is still out there,” said Parson.
“Do you think she’s here? In Paris?” Roderick asked.
“No,” Parson replied. “I believe she’s in London.”
“And you want me to come with you?” Roderick asked, despite Sébastien’s protestations.
“Yes,” said Parson, holding Roderick’s gaze with his eyes. “Will you?”
Against his better judgment, Roderick found himself nodding.
“Yes.”</Text>

            <Title>The distinctive ringing of metal sang out as Kasumi</Title>
            <Text>The distinctive ringing of metal sang out as Kasumi Hattori unsheathed her katana. She held her breath and rounded the corner, keeping her footsteps as soft and light as she could manage. Her quarry was only a few paces ahead and had yet to notice her presence. With a layer of putrid blood caked on her face and slathered on her clothes, she was all but invisible to the creature she was pursuing.
In the near distance, somebody was crying out for help. The creature quickened its pace, staggering around the corner. Though it was only a little past noon, it was nearly lost in the darkness. What little light crept beyond the imposing shadow of London’s Great Wall was filtered through a thick haze of fog. She hurried after the creature, while it pursued its own prey, unaware that it was being followed.
As she rounded the next corner, she took in the scene and raised her sword. The creature she’d been following was a woman, barely older than Kas, her hair wild and unkempt, her eyes lifeless, her teeth and chin stained with blood. The woman growled like an animal and reached out to grab the boy in front of her. The boy screamed, covered his eyes, and waited for the woman to tear into his flesh with her bare hands.
Instead, her head struck the ground with a dull thud and rolled across the cobblestones, still gnashing its teeth. Kas put her boot down on it with a satisfying crunch. She wiped her sword on a rag and began to slide it into its sheath. She stopped halfway.
“Were you bitten?”
The boy had been limping. He was injured, sickly looking, and exhausted. This was why the woman had been able to overtake him so easily and why he hadn’t been fighting to his last breath. He was pale, dirty, and his pant leg was stained and crusted over with what looked like dried blood. He smelt of death.
He shook his head. “No.”
She’d heard that lie a hundred times before. No one ever admitted to the bite. People knew what it meant to be bitten. A voice in Kas’s head protested, liar! She would have to see for herself.
She reached down and lifted his trouser leg, pealing away a layer of loose skin with it. He winced as she looked at his ankle. Bite marks. Deep. Nearly down to the bone. Black, necrotic flesh was already beginning to spread up his leg.
She unsheathed her sword again.</Text>

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>Roderick turned and fled. It was all he could do to keep himself from vomiting in the streets. And from thinking about the horrific scene he’d just witnessed.
Bailey, he thought in horror. Oh, god, Bailey.
Behind him, a dead man shovelled mouthfuls of meat and fur into his mouth, and Roderick could still hear him chewing. It was deafening. He lost his footing, fell to the ground, head-first. Slammed into the hard stone, but barely felt it. He scrambled to rise, but he hurt more than he realised. It was difficult to move.
He felt a warm tongue on his face and reeled back in panic. In a moment, he was back on his feet and was turning to flee. But as he ran, he looked back down at the ground where he’d fallen. Standing there, wagging his tail happily, was Bailey.
He blinked in confusion. He looked back at the undead man who still stood, noisily chewing, then back again at Bailey. Unharmed. Untouched.
“Good god, Bailey, you worried me!”
Confusion turned to relief. He reached down and scooped up his dog into his arms, cradled him like a child, and Bailey returned his affection as dogs do, licking the dirt from his face.
“Must have been a rat or a squirrel,” he remarked happily.
But there was little time to rejoice in their reunion. The dead man had finished his meal and had begun to advance toward the duo, mouth still bloody but clearly still hungry.
Roderick turned to flee, and nearly stumbled into another shadowy figure, which blocked his path and snarled.
He stepped back. An undead man in each direction. Bailey in his arms. And he was unarmed.
The dead men continued to close in, while Roderick continued to back up, inching further from one dead man but closer to the other. But as he moved through the dark, foggy alleyway, a door presented itself. The side door to some shop, or somebody’s house, Roderick wasn’t sure which.
He put his hand on the knob and tried the door. He swore. It was locked.
The wood was old, splintered, the doorknob flimsy. Perhaps he could force it open. Not with Bailey in his arms though. He set the dog down. The undead continued to move in on them.
“Stay,” he said, sternly.
Then he slammed into the door, putting his shoulder into it. It looked like the flimsy, structurally unsound sort of door that might cave in under a hard shoulder-check, but the door did not yield. He tried again, slamming into it with all his weight.
Bailey began to bark.
Again, Roderick slammed into the door, and again, it refused to budge.
Meanwhile, the dead men closed in, shuffling slowly on limbs stiffened by rigor mortis.
Bravely, Bailey tried to fend them off with his bark, yapping loudly to ward them off. Still, they advanced, paying him no mind, even as he nipped at their ankles. Roderick shouted at him to stay, but they weren’t interested in Bailey. Not with Roderick so close they could almost reach out and touch him.
“There’s a good dog,” he said. “Keep them busy, my friend. This is it. One last shot.”
He stepped back as far as he could and aimed once more for the door, putting everything he could into it.</Text>

            <Title>Mr. Lockwood joined Professor Ashcroft at the window</Title>
            <Text>Henri-Charles joined Jonathan and Dr. Sound at the window, and looked out at the fearsome beast. The men stared in silence at the beast as it approached Gravesend. Ollie’s voice from the exterior of The Penny Dreadful broke the silence. Jonathan hurriedly made his way along the short hallway to the crew cabin, Henri-Charles and Dr. Sound following in his wake. They made their way through the cabin, barely causing the crewmen to turn their heads, busy as they were with their own work, and pushed open the hatch. A powerful gust of air whistled and howled its way into the cabin.
“Ollie,” said Jonathan, bracing himself against the railing.
“Good god, Cap,” said the pilot, shouting over the drone of the ship’s engines. “I never imagined—”
“Nor I,” Jonathan replied. “Let's take up our battle stations. Ollie, would you summon Miss Hattori? That woman is deadly with a cannon.”
“That she is,” said the pilot, and he reached for his communication device, which carried his command through the speaking tubes. Given that Kasumi was even more proficient with a weapon than with a wrench, Jonathan had insisted she take on an apprentice. “Graves, take over for Miss Hattori in the engine room. Worthington, take up position at the port side cannon.”
The din of machine gun fire and the sound of screams reached them. The enemy had reached Gravesend.
“Good god! They’re firing on civilians!” cried Dr. Sound.
One of the crewmen, presumably Worthington, took up his position at the cannon, while Henri-Charles took up the maxim gun. A moment Kasumi Hattori joined them on deck, her katana strapped to her back. Though she’d been alternating between duties as zombie hunter and engineer, she didn’t show the slightest sign of fatigue. Her eyes were fierce and fearless. “Let’s squash this bug.”
Henri-Charles was already settling in at the gun turret. Hurriedly, he began loading it with what appeared to be a lifetime’s supply of ammunition. He aimed through the weapon’s scope.
“Fire at will!” shouted Jonathan.
The big Haitian didn’t need to be told twice. Jonathan hung by the doorway and watched as the crewman held down the trigger and unloaded a hundred bullets into the abominable cockroach. He whistled in appreciation of the weapon.
Bullets bounced off the creature’s hard shell, each round as insignificant to the magnificent beast as a mosquito bite to a man. All they'd done was alert the bug to their presence. The beast whipped its frightful head around and looked straight at the Penny Dreadful. Its flight was clumsy, its maneuverability awkward. But that was hardly cause for comfort. They could see the Resurrectionists in the ship’s cockpit.
“I think they see us,” Jonathan remarked.
It flew toward them.
“Oh, god!” cried Dr. Sound, his eyes widening.
Henri-Charles unleashed another barrage of bullet fire, but the result was the same. Nothing.
“Evasive maneuvers!” bellowed Jonathan. He shouted into the speaking tubes. “Unfurl the mizzenmast!”
The sound of the creature’s outrage drowned out his words. Shrill, ear-shatteringly loud, and utterly unnatural.
Jonathan felt the ship start to ease backward, heard the ship’s sail unfurl. Too slow.
The creature’s antenna struck the side of the ship. Its impact shuddered through the craft. Wood shattered into pieces, and the world seemed to turn on its side. The clouds seemed to tip over like clumsy white sheep. Jonathan grasped a railing and held tight. His feet lifted off the ground, and his hand slid along the railing. His grip was tenuous, but with a grunt of effort he managed to swing his other arm around and get a hold of the railing. Finally, the ship righted itself.
“Everyone all right?” he heard Ollie shout.
“Fine,” he replied, though he felt like he might be sick. He hated flying, but he hated showing any sign of weakness in front of the airship crew even more. He looked to Kasumi, who seemed unfazed.
“I’ll take the starboard cannon,” she said.
“I’d hoped you would,” Jonathan answered. “Thanks, Kas.”
Keeping a hand on the railing, she took a moment to survey the aftermath of the creature’s attack. Then she headed for the cannon. Worthington was already readying a cannonball at the cannon opposite her.
Ollie was strapped in to his seat, and though he’d lost his hat, revealing a mess of dark brown hair, he appeared otherwise unharmed. Henri-Charles had likewise lashed himself down; even his hat was still on his head. As for the creature, Jonathan had lost sight of it. He whirled around. How can a creature that size just disappear?
From beneath the ship, he heard the heavy mechanical clicking of an enormous gun being reloaded. The enemy airship suddenly appeared in front of them, rearing its ugly head from below.
“Get down!” he cried.
The crew hit the floor. Bullets whizzed by the pilot's head, only narrowly missing him.
Jonathan couldn’t see if Kasumi or Henri-Charles had taken shelter, but he could hear bullets ringing off the dirigible’s armor, which suddenly seemed dangerously frail. He knew the armor wouldn’t hold out for long. And if the armor that covered the ballonets was penetrated, the hydrogen-filled ballonets could explode with just the slightest spark, engulfing them in flames.
“Ollie!” he shouted. “The shields!”
“Aye, Captain! I’m a little busy!” Ollie shouted back.
After a moment, the pilot pulled a lever, and a wall of plate metal swung up to shield the balloons. Bullets pinged off the metal wall, ricocheting dangerously.
Jonathan took the opportunity to load his rifle. Jonathan’s father had once kept a sizable weapons collection aboard the airship, and since the fall of London, Jonathan had been doing his best to add to that collection.
“Dr. Sound,” he said, turning back to the scientist, who stood in the doorway. “I suggest you grab yourself a weapon. Whatever you think looks most dangerous, I suppose.”
“But I’m a scientist, not a soldier,” Dr. Sound protested.
“Yes, well, you’ll be a dead scientist if we don’t act,” Jonathan retorted. “Consider it an experiment. I hypothesize that if we put a whole lot of bullets in that thing, it will die. Now, let’s apply the scientific method to the situation.”
He grinned.
The sound of cannon fire deafened them both momentarily, but it was a reassuring sound. It meant that Kas was operating the cannon.
She was relentless, firing a second shot almost immediately after the first. The ship rocked with the boom of cannon fire. Her next shot managed to crack the creature’s chitinous shell, and the beast opened its fearsome maw and uttered its shrill, piercing cry.
Focus, Jonathan had to remind himself. Focus. While the monstrous beast appeared to have been wounded by Kas’s cannon fire, the Resurrectionists did not seem to care. The Resurrectionists were merciless as they continued to unleash a hail of bullets at the Dreadful and would probably do so until they ran out of bullets or took down the airship, whichever came first.
Jonathan watched as Ollie crawled along the floor, back to his position at the helm of the ship; bullets hailing around him be damned, he had a ship to operate. Jonathan had to admire that. Finally, the Resurrectionists let up.
It was the Dreadful’s turn. Again the ship shuddered as cannonballs launched at the abominable cockroach and punctured holes into its carapace, not stopping it but at least doing damage.
Jonathan was determined not to be the weak link in the crew, in spite of his fear of heights. With his belly full of liquid courage, he headed out onto the bow of the airship, wind whistling through his hair. He braced himself against the railing and raised his pistol. He emptied the chamber, hitting the mark with every bullet fired, but that was little cause for celebration. Nothing seemed to hurt the creature. Even the barrage of cannon fire from Kas and Worthington had barely slowed the thing down.
He frowned. As he’d always said, the way to win a fight wasn’t simply to hit your opponent harder than he hit you; you had to hit where it hurt most. This monster was just like any other zombie, though. They could hack off all of its limbs, tear off its wings, and it might not even notice. The only way to stop it was with a headshot. Which was easier said than done, considering that its head was entirely safe beneath its thick shell of carapace, much like the rest of its body. Its weak point, then, was not its head. Its weakness was the control room housed in its body. Protected only by a pane of glass, this was where they needed to hit the beast.
“Ollie, tell them not to aim at the creature!” he shouted.
Ollie turned around and put a hand to one ear, miming that he couldn’t make out what he was saying. Jonathan swore under his breath. Of course not. Of course he couldn’t hear over the sound of bullets hammering against the ship's armor, or the shrieking of the blustering wind as they tore through the air at high speed. There was nothing for it but to get closer.
The unfortunate thing was, there was a length of the ship that was not shielded by the ship's armor. In order to reach Ollie, he would have to pass through it. He would be completely exposed to any stray bullets that might come his way.
He reached the edge of the armored section. It was only about a meter from where he stood to the next sheet of armor near the captain’s perch. He spared a glance up toward the monster, shivering against the frigid air. The beast was still flying steadily after them, while the Penny Dreadful was flying in reverse, keeping just out of its range. The onslaught of bullets had ceased for the moment, but already the creature’s guns were whirring up for a second go at them. If the second onslaught lasted as long as the first, they wouldn’t survive it. The familiar mechanical sound of gears clicking into place spurred him into action.
He dashed across the open expanse of the ship’s prow, leaving both the safety of the railing and the protection of the shields. The wind rushed up around his arms. Bullets splintered the wooden deck around him. He pushed himself to keep running and not look back.
At last he managed to reach Ollie’s post, and gripped the railing in front of him. He repeated his message, and the pilot looked at him like he was barking mad.
“Then where should they aim?”
“There!” he said, pointing at the ship’s control room. “Take out the Resurrectionists and there will be no one to pilot that thing.”
The pilot nodded. “Good thinking,” he said. “Consider it done.”
He began barking orders at the crew through his communication device. Another barrage of bullets struck the Dreadful, putting dents in her shields and drowning out the pilot’s voice.
“We can’t hold out much longer, Captain,” said Ollie.
“Just keep at it, Mr. Lockwood,” Jonathan replied.
Ollie nodded. “Aye, Captain,” he said, turning the steering wheel with expert precision.
The Dreadful returned fire. The next cannon blast struck glass. The Resurrectionists inside the control room flinched, and a spiderweb began to crack along the glass.
“Keep that up!” Jonathan cried. “Hit it again!”
The enemy airship continued to fire back and didn’t let up. Their supply of ammunition couldn’t be limitless. They would run out of bullets eventually, but he knew they wouldn’t outlast it. The battle had turned into a punching match, but at least the Dreadful was punching back now. They needed to punch harder.
“Don’t quit now!” Jonathan roared. “Hit them again!”
The cannons boomed, and the glass splintered further. This time it was the Resurrectionists’ turn to take evasive action. The airship turned, but it was already too late. The next cannon blast shattered the windshield, raining glass down on the town below.
“After them!” Jonathan shouted. “We have them now!”
Again, Ollie pulled at the steering wheel, yanking on a lever to control the airship’s rudder. He barked an order into the communication device, and the airship changed direction, the crew heroically springing to action, hauling on the lines and relying on the wind in the sails to give them a surge forward.
“Sir!” a voice shouted from somewhere behind Jonathan. The wind played havoc with the sound of voices, but as he turned around, he spotted Dr. Sound at the doorway. He mouthed a few words that Jonathan couldn’t make out, then raised his hands to reveal what he’d found in the weapon room. A pair of hand grenades.
Jonathan nodded. “That will do!” he shouted back. “That will do nicely!”</Text>
            <Comments> "reached for his communication device, which carried his command through the speaking tubes. "  That makes it sound like some kind of hybrid system, and that's good  (Oh, but when you get to the mizzenmast command you say "He shouted into the speaking tubes".  A bit of a consistency issue.)
 (A Gatling gun is traditionally fed by a box or drum magazine. And was normally hand-cranked by the gunner with a loader changing magazines and helping the ammunition to feed into the gun.  If this is a fantasy,  ‘steam-powered’ Gat, you have lots of colorful description you can add.  Let us know.)

You’ve admitted to being unfamiliar with naval terminology, and it shows up here.  “Unfurl the mizzenmast!”  Uh, a mast cannot be unfurled.  Perhaps “Unfurl the mains’l!”?
(‘Evasive maneuvers would never be to try to slow and stop a multi-ton vessel’s forward motion.  Whether in water or air, stopping any mass like that would take waaaay too long.  He could ‘bring her about’ (ie turn around) which would be a rough enough maneuver in itself.  More likely they would change course in other random ways.)
(Problematical.  Is the captain incompetent?  Wouldn’t he know to put up the shields?  If he just had his hands full steering, let him say so or at least be cross that he’s being told what to do on his own ship.) 
If the airship has metallic shields, why wouldn't they already be in place?  Weight is an airship's enemy, so the mechanism(s) to deploy, or retract them would seem unnecessary..
I like your idea for having some retract, and some not.  It's a compromise, and I'm  a big fan of compromise.  I don't know how you actually see them, but I'm imagining something like the hinged metal shutters than close down over storefronts in big cities.  This is exactly how the shutters on the viewports on CR&amp;A's roverhome work in my stories.  Although, on an airship, they'd probably have to extend up, rather than down.
I really liked that line-  just had to say.
(location/position check here-  We left the captain ‘latched’ (lashed?) in his seat.  Also, you can say this with dialogue.  Let the Captain say,  “Gunfire be damned, I have a ship to steer!” or something like that.)
(A ‘chamber’ holds a single round, I believe you mean, ‘He emptied the cylinder,’) 
And more entomology.  Realizing that it's a zombie insect (which means the brain should be destroyed) was a great conclusion by Jonathan.  I had missed that, and he actually reminded me of it.  But an insect brain is pretty primitive.  Even if it could be shot in the head, it would probably need several hits before it realized it was supposed to be dead.  Shooting at the 'pilots' is good, but since the Penny Dreadful has machine guns, another good target would be the wings.  Enough damage there, and it would just fall out of the sky.  OK, I do think it works better the way you wrote it, and I think I get why it's better, but maybe a bit more to let a new reader know why would help.
(If he couldn’t hear—which is quite logical-- then he wouldn’t have turned around—right?) 
 (You specified the creature’s guns as ‘machineguns’,  Powered Gatling guns ‘whir’ machinegun’s don’t.) 
(You need to begin this with him taking off.)

            <Title>Scene 80</Title>
            <Synopsis>Annabel gets answers from Anthony Tidkins, and considers killing him. She puts her finger on the trigger and - someone shoots him. She sees the shooter and recognizes him.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The scientists were sounding the alarm, a deafening, undulating sound that Annabel had heard the last time she'd visited the Resurrectionist facility.
She returned her attention to Palmer, who was trying to get up. She kicked him in the back, and he grunted in pain. She looked again at Anthony Tidkins.
“Is it really too late?” she asked him, having to shout to be heard over the alarm.
“For us?” he asked.
Tidkins had taken off his mask, which he now held in one hand. His face was as familiar to her as her own. In all the time she’d known him, he’d barely changed in appearance. But his demeanor had changed. The way he looked at her now, he was a completely different person, a stranger. Part of her wondered, though, if he had really changed at all. Maybe it was just her.
“For London, I mean,” she said. Careful not to let her emotion show, she looked him in the eye and with careful inflection, she said, “It is most definitely too late for us.”
He nodded. “Fair enough,” he said, as the siren sound came to an end.
Perhaps she was mistaken, but she thought she detected a hint of regret in his pale pink eyes, a note of sadness in his voice. Damn him. What did she care about his feelings? He was a mass murderer. She felt sick just thinking about what he had done. And yet, at one time, she had thought of him like a brother. A part of her always would feel that way about him, she realized.
“It isn’t too late for London,” he said. “Once I find a cure—“
Her stomach tightened. “If you find a cure,” she said, “And even then it will still be too late. What about all those people who’ve been killed by your zombies?”
She thought about Rémy. She hadn’t really known him, but he’d seemed like a sweet young man. Innocent, and in love. And now he was dead. A victim of Dead London.
“It will be worth it,” he answered. “I will have cured death. No one else will need to die. Not ever.”
Annabel thought she might be sick. She couldn’t concentrate on Anthony Tidkins and on Palmer at the same time. She decided to simplify things. She slammed the butt of her gun into Palmer’s skull with her mechanical arm. He slumped to the floor, unconscious. Or dead, Annabel could hardly care less.
“You want to cure death so bad you’d destroy a city of millions? Why is this so important to you?”
“Because my father is dying,” he said simply.
It took her only a moment.
“You mean Dr. Jekyll?” she asked. “Not your real father.”
“Dr. Jekyll is my real father,” he said. “I was his bastard son. He and my mother gave me up for adoption. Dr. Jekyll’s wife wouldn’t let him keep me, and the mother was in a similar position. My adoptive parents were unable to have children of their own. When my adoptive mother died, my father came to resent me, as if it was somehow my fault. He sent me to live with Dr. Jekyll; he and his wife had divorced by then. My adoptive father told me I was to be Dr. Jekyll’s apprentice. Jekyll was a renowned surgeon, and my father wanted me to be trained by him. It was only later, much later, that I learned the real reason I’d been sent to Dr. Jekyll. Dr. Jekyll was my father.”
“And you thought you could save him?”
“I can save him,” Tidkins said with passion. He had tears in his eyes. “I have to save him.”
“Even if it costs the lives of millions?” Annabel asked.
“I’m sorry,” he said, and Annabel believed him.
At last, Annabel understood. Anthony Tidkins was insane. He was brilliant. But he was insane.
Her hand was trembling, her vision unclear. She steeled herself. Before she could put further thought into it, she raised the pistol. Point blank, she aimed its muzzle at her oldest friend and put her finger on the trigger.
Tidkins’ skull erupted in a spray of blood.
Annabel screamed.
Tidkins’s blood spattered across her cheek, hot and wet. It seemed to sting as it struck her skin. She heard Abraham Palmer gasp, but her attention was focused on Anthony Tidkins. His eyes and mouth wide with surprise, a gaping hole through his left cheek.
“No!” Annabel cried, even as Tidkins’ body collapsed to the floor.
Annabel stared at her gun and blinked in confusion.
“But I…” she gaped, “I didn’t pull the trigger.”
She’d wanted to. She had desperately wanted to put a bullet in his skull for everything that he’d done. But for all of her resolve to be more ruthless and less sentimental, she still hadn’t been able to bring herself to kill him. Even if he deserved it, she had to consider that Abraham Palmer might be right. Anthony Tidkins—Jack—might very well have been their best hope for a cure. Now it was too late.
She stared at the gun in her hand. It was still cold. Which meant she couldn’t have fired it.
Then who could have—?
She spun around, looking for the shooter, and found a familiar face staring back at her, gun still smoking.</Text>

            <Title>Scene</Title>
            <Text>As it turned out, Avery’s ribs were not broken, although they were bruised badly enough that he winced in pain whenever he stooped over or stood up too quickly. His household staff hadn’t been murdered, as he’d feared. They’d been rendered unconscious by the doctor’s brutish accomplice, but they had recovered well enough. Soon, the doctor’s visit was little more than a bad memory, and Avery was back to his usual routine, with one singular exception. Much as he resented the doctor for burdening him with the responsibility of tutoring Jack, he could not fault the boy.
In fact, his young apprentice was an admirable student, with a tireless work ethic, an aptitude and an eagerness to comprehend whatever lesson Avery was trying to impart, and the keen interest that only a child can have. Of course, he had spat on Avery’s face, but he had since apologized, and the act had been encouraged by Dr. Jekyl. Once away from the doctor’s influence, the boy’s behavior was considerably different.
He was quiet, patient, and intelligent. Avery soon came to feel that he had misjudged Jack. That cruel look he thought he’d seen in Jack’s eyes was imagined, more likely a result of Avery’s prejudice against the boy’s strange looks than anything else.
Jack was an avid reader, as Avery came to find out. He devoured Avery’s texts on clockmaking, but on more than one occasion, he had caught the boy reading penny dreadfuls. The Mysteries of London was his favorite—and he enjoyed pretending that he was Anthony Tidkins, the graverobber from the stories. The Resurrection Man.
In his spare time, Jack began to apply Avery’s lessons and those gleaned from the pages of his books to tinkering with little gadgets and inventions of his own devising. Avery saw no harm in letting him borrow scraps from his pile to devote to these side projects. Jack’s surgical knowledge, and his small, steady hands, proved useful in clockmaking, and Avery felt certain that given enough time, Jack would eventually surpass even him.
He showed him how to make a simple simple pocket watch, and Jack replicated it perfectly. He presented Jack with a broken clock and asked him to repair it. It was ticking away within half an hour.
After a while, Avery actually came to enjoy having the boy around, even if he was only there because of the doctor’s threats. As the days turned to weeks and the weeks to months, the doctor’s return loomed ominously on the calendar. Avery was saddened to think that he would lose his student.
Eventually, he decided to broach the subject with Jack. “Perhaps when the doctor returns, you could continue to study with me,” he said, “If you like.”
Avery wasn’t sure what he’d been expecting. Gratitude, perhaps? Eagerness? Instead, he received a cold look, the same deadpan stare that he’d first seen upon meeting Jack. He hadn’t imagined it, after all.
“I see little need for that,” Jack replied. “I’m beginning to feel I’ve already learned everything you can possibly teach me.”
Avery clenched his fist, his hand shaking violently. He reminded himself that Jack was just a boy, and that he’d had a rather queer upbringing. Perhaps with the right mentor, Jack could still learn to refine his behavior, his manners.
“I find that clockmaking shares a great deal in common with surgery, but it is much simpler, by comparison. After all, what are human beings if not incredibly complicated machines?” Jack continued. “Having mastered surgery, clockmaking seems beneath my skill. Any child could do it.”
Avery snorted. “You are a child,” he reminded Jack.
He would not stand here and have his trade so crudely insulted. Any hint of the patient, passionate boy Avery had come to know and love was gone, replaced with the cruel, arrogant brat who’d spat on his face. He recognized a duality in Jack, a duality he’d once seen in himself when the disease had taken hold of him. Avery was not the same man that had killed and eaten his family, just as Jack was not the same boy who’d spat on his face and who stood before him now. This version of Jack was someone different, a second personality that lay dormant within him.
All this time that Avery had been teaching Jack the art of clockmaking, the other Jack had been there, somewhere distant in the dark recesses of Jack’s mind. It wasn’t sickness that brought him forth, at least not a physical sickness. Perhaps a mental illness, or perhaps it was just that duality that exists in all men.
Avery took a deep breath. “You overestimate your own skill as a clockmaker,” he said, “And you underestimate the complexity of clocks. Your analogy is apt; people are indeed like complicated machines, but the tools used in clockmaking are vastly different from those used by a surgeon. We use calipers and die plates, rivet pliers, and turns, where surgeons use scalpels, bone saws, and forceps. We work with metal, where surgeons deal in flesh. What makes a clock tick is not the same as what makes a man tick.”
Jack raised an eyebrow. At least, Avery had his attention.
“Do you know what it’s called when a timepiece includes a feature  that goes beyond simply displaying hours and minutes?”
“Complications,” he answered.
Avery was hardly surprised that Jack already knew the answer. He would have read a dozen books on the subject by now.
“So far, I’ve only taught you simple movements. Perhaps that was my mistake. I’m not accustomed to having a student. No wonder you’re beginning to tire of horology. Why don’t we try something with complications?”
Jack smiled, and nodded enthusiastically. The other Jack was gone again. Like a leech sucking the bad blood out of an infected wound, it was boredom that drew out the other Jack. The doctor had warned him that Jack was easily susceptible to boredom. Only now did Avery grasp what that meant.
“It is my firm belief that clocks can be just as complicated as people, depending on the skill of the clockmaker,” Avery told him. “If man is made by god, and machine is made by man, suppose you could build a machine as complex as man. What would that make you?”
“God,” Jack answered.
Avery nodded. “Now, tell me. Are you still bored?”</Text>
            <Notes> At last, he showed the boy how to make a clockwork caterpillar, and Jack took what he’d learned but instead he made a butterfly, which flitted gracefully about the room.</Notes>

Occupation:		Heir to the Grimmer Publishing Company
 	

Physical Description:	Jonathan has dark hair swept back over his forehead in waves. His skin is white and freckled despite the darkness of his hair. Tall, broad-shouldered, and with an athletic frame, his very posture exudes confidence that borders on arrogance. He is immaculately dressed in rich tones of grey with hints of blue on his ascot, to match his eyes. His clothes are perfectly tailored but understated. He moves gracefully, and smiles charmingly when he does smile.

Personality:		Jonathan is highly determined; once he sets his mind to something, he will not abandon the endeavour even when he believes his efforts are in vain. Jonathan is suave, charming, and has a devil-may-care attitude. Impolite, rude, and brash, his intentions are good, though his attitude is bad.

Habits/Mannerisms:	Mr. O smokes heavily, drinks heavily, and has the bad habit of shrugging indifferently
 	

Background:		When Jonathan was just a boy, he contracted a virus that has come to be known as Lazarus. Only in its infancy in those days, the virus brought him back from the brink of death. It was curable, thanks to the efforts of the finest doctors his family’s money could buy, but highly contagious. The virus spread, and it adapted.

            <Title>Scene 79</Title>
            <Synopsis>Jonathan confronts Solomon Grundy</Synopsis>
            <Text>Jonathan crept along the dimly lit hallway, the undulating tones of the siren reverberating throughout the facility. Their plan had already failed, if the Resurrectionists knew they were here. He could have killed Palmer for his betrayal. If Roderick or Miss Monday ended up hurt because of it, he really would.
He needed to hurry, though. Abandoning stealth, he raced down the hallway toward the laboratory. As he rounded the corner, the siren sound cut off, and Jonathan nearly ran straight into a pair of Resurrectionists. He came to an abrupt halt and held his breath. They had their backs to him, but it was nothing short of a miracle that they didn’t turn around and face him.
He drew his gun just to be ready. Quietly, he doubled back around the corner, and positioned himself so that he could see them, but they could not see him so easily.
The one on the left was a woman. She had dark brown skin, and her hair was neatly braided into cornrows. Jonathan watched as she pulled her mask down over her face and looked out through the tinted glass of the mask’s eyes.
“Put your mask back on,” she said to her partner. “My fiancée’s gaze can be somewhat intoxicating.”
The man snorted. “I’m sure I can resist Mr. Sinews’ charms.”
Jonathan clamped his hand over his mouth to suppress a gasp. Parson Sinews’ fiancée was a Resurrectionist? He wondered if Sinews knew. No wonder she’d been at Lord Connor’s. Jonathan was hardly surprised to learn that Sinews’ taste in women tended towards the exotic.
“I wouldn’t be so sure, Mr. Grundy,” she replied.
Jonathan’s eyes widened. Of all the Resurrectionists Jonathan could have run into, here was Solomon Grundy, the man he’d first met at Lord Connor’s masquerade, along with Miss Lucy Marshall. The woman with Grundy now was not Miss Marshall, but another woman, who Jonathan didn’t recognize.
As they rounded the next corner of the hallway, Jonathan followed, gun at the ready. If they turned and spotted him, he would enjoy putting a bullet into Grundy’s arrogant face. As for Mr. Sinews’ fiancée, he wasn’t so sure. Could he really shoot an unarmed woman, even if she was a Resurrectionist? He was about to find out.
He followed them around the next corner, then came to a halt. The Resurrectionists stood in front of the holding cells. Jonathan could make out the shadowy figure of the prisoner in the cell. It was Parson Sinews.
“Hello, Parson,” said the woman. “My name is Dr. Mircalla Karnstein, and this is Solomon Grundy. We’re here to take you to Chateau d’If.”
Again, Jonathan’s eyes widened at what he was hearing. He recalled Miss Monday’s story about going to Haiti with Anthony Tidkins. They’d met with  a woman named Mircalla Karnstein. A dark-skinned woman who wore her hair in cornrows. It had to be the same woman. He remembered that Monday had learned Dr. Karnstein’s real name.
“Camille,” said Parson Sinews. “Did you think I wouldn’t recognize you?”
“Darling,” she said, soothingly.
“Mircalla?” he said with a sneer. “A clever alias, I grant you. A pseudonym within a pseudonym.”
“So you’ve read, Carmilla?” she asked.
“The name suits you. Carmilla was a deceptive whore.”
“Time to go, Mr. Sinews,” said Grundy, interrupting the lover’s quarrel.
Jonathan wondered how Mr. Sinews had guessed Dr. Karnstein’s identity so easily. Was her voice so familiar to him that he could recognize it despite the strange distortion of the gas mask? Or were her movements and mannerisms so distinct that he could recognize her despite her face being covered? Then again, maybe it was the cornrows that gave her away.
Jonathan watched as a couple of guards appeared, opened the door of Sinews’ cell, and led him from it. Jonathan stepped out into the hallway and raised his pistol. Sinews saw him first, and ducked to avoid being shot.
Jonathan fired, hitting one of the guards in the shoulder. The Resurrectionists cried out in surprise. Though Sinews was bound at the wrists, with his arms tied behind his back, he leapt into action. He twisted his arms, with a sickening pop as his shoulders dislocated, to get his arms in front of him. Then, grabbing the second guard around the neck, he used the ropes that bound his wrists to begin strangling the man.
Jonathan fired another shot, putting yet another bullet into the first guard. Meanwhile, Solomon Grundy managed to grab the guard’s gun out of his belt. He leveled it at Jonathan and fired, missing narrowly. Jonathan ducked back around the corner as another bullet struck the wall he’d been standing in front of just a second ago. The smell of cordite filled the air.
Grundy fired another shot as warning, forcing Jonathan to stay put. He wondered how Sinews was faring, and risked sticking his head out to look. Grundy nearly took his head off with another bullet. Jonathan sucked in a breath, and retreated behind the wall again.
If he’d known what type of gun Grundy carried, he might have been able to count his ammunition, and mount his counter-attack while Grundy was reloading. As it was, he had no idea how well-fortified his adversaries were. He couldn’t risk firing without seeing what he was looking at, or he’d be just as likely to hit Parson Sinews as to hit the Resurrectionists. And he couldn’t risk stepping out without being fired upon himself. For now, the Resurrectionists had the upper hand. There was nothing he could do but wait and be ready.
He heard Grundy’s voice, distinct only in that it was deeper than Dr. Karnstein’s. “Take him. I’ll deal with Mr. Grimmer.”
Jonathan grinned. Outnumbered, the Resurrectionists had the upper hand. But given the chance to fight Grundy one-on-one, Jonathan would take his chances any day. He still had four bullets in his pistol, more than enough to take out Solomon Grundy.
“Come out and face me, Jonathan,” he called out arrogantly.
Instead, Jonathan waited. He would fight Grundy, but he would do it on his own terms. He didn’t need to risk a fair fight.
“Solomon Grundy,” he shouted back, taunting, “Born on a Monday, christened on Tuesday.”
“So, you know the rhyme?” Grundy shouted back, his voice drawing nearer. He fired pistol, shattering bits of brick only inches from Jonathan’s face. “Married on Wednesday.”
“Took ill on Thursday,” Jonathan replied, sticking his arm out to fire back at Grundy.
“Got worse on Friday,” Grundy sneered, firing again, getting still closer to Jonathan, the bullet ricocheting loudly.
By the sound of Grundy’s voice, the angle of his gunfire, Jonathan had formed a picture in his head of where Grundy was standing, and where his gun was pointed. He only hoped he was right.
He stepped out into the hallway.
“Died on Saturday,” he said as he fired the first bullet.  He put two more in Grundy’s chest. “Buried on Sunday.”
He watched as Grundy hit the ground and lay still. The two guards lay dead by the door to Sinews’ cell, but there was no sign of Karnstein or Sinews.
“That was the end of Solomon Grundy,” he muttered as he stepped over the body, not feeling the least bit of pity for the man.
He hurried along the hallway, reloading his pistol as he went. He rounded the next corner, hoping to catch sight of Sinews and Karnstein. Instead, the hallway was overrun by zombies.</Text>

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>When he was a young boy, he found a bird lying in the fountain. It was half-drowned, its wing was broken, but it was not dead. He waded into the water, against his father’s protests, and lifted the crow from the water. It had seemed like the bird had lost consciousness, but when the boy picked it up, the bird began to struggle again. Its efforts were weak though, and the boy held tight to the bird.
“Fix him, daddy,” he pleaded, holding the bird up to his father, the doctor.
Instead, his father scolded him for picking up the bird, and tried to take the wounded creature from him. He wailed and screamed as his father reached down to take the bird. He turned and ran, disappearing into the garden.
He hid beneath a rose bush, and though the thorns pricked him, he kept quiet and stayed still. He shushed the bird when it began to squawk, petting its head gently until it quieted.
He heard their voices, calling to him. Asking him to come out of hiding. Promising that everything was alright, that he wouldn’t be in trouble. They just wanted him to come out of hiding. Not just his father’s voice, but the voices of his father’s servants as well. Everyone was out looking for him.
Night fell before they found him, his little body cold and bloodied by the rose’s thorns.
He was sure to be beaten for this. Sure to be scolded, at the very least.
His father was standing there with an unreadable expression on his face. Half stern, half relieved. His mother was all tears. She bent down to hold him in her arms, but he shrugged off her embrace, concerned his crow might be squashed.
“Daddy,” he implored once again.
The crow’s feathers had dried, but its wing was still broken, and it was still weak and in pain.
“Fix him,” he begged.
There were hundreds of books in his father’s library, a doctor’s books. Books of science and medicine. Surely, his father could flip through the pages of his books and learn how to set the broken wing of a bird. That was all it would take, and the crow’s life would be saved.
“Please,” said the boy.
Finally, the doctor’s face softened. He stooped down and held out his large, gentle hands, not grasping angrily for the bird this time, but reaching out as if to help.
Cautiously, and ready to pull the bird back into his own arms at the slightest indication that his father’s gesture was false. He put the bird into his father’s hands.
“There,” said the doctor.
At last, his father took the bird inside, went straight up to his office with the bird firmly in hand.
“Will you fix him?” said the boy, trailing after.
“Hush now,” said his mother. “Let your father do his work.”</Text>
            <Notes>Removed:

He looked down at his son, his mouth set in a stern line, his eyes hard and unyielding. Then he snapped the crow’s neck.
“I’ve fixed him,” he said.</Notes>

            <Title>Jonathan watched in stunned silence as the beast’s limbs came crashing down</Title>
            <Text>Jonathan watched in stunned silence as the beast’s limbs came crashing down on the ship. Shards of wood splintered. The world turned on its side. He caught sight of Worthington, slumped over, blood spilling from his mouth. There was a wooden beam through the man’s stomach. He heard the whoosh of escaping hydrogen, and clung to the railing as they began to go down.
“Drop ballast!” Ollie shouted.
Torrents of water spilled down onto the streets below, and the ship slowed its downward spiral, but not enough. They were going down, there was no stopping that. All they could do was control their descent. Their only saving grace was that the beast seemed to have lost interest in the ship for the moment. Something must have distracted it.
“We’ve got to lose the shields!” shouted the pilot.
“I didn’t know that was possible,” Jonathan answered.
“It has to be done manually,” Ollie answered. He grabbed the communication device and shouted for all hands on deck. “Take a spanner and a screwdriver. Do whatever you can to get rid of those shields. Do that, and we might actually be able to get her steady.”
Jonathan nodded. There was no time to argue. He crossed the deck and pulled open the hatch to the crew cabin.
"We need to lose the shields!" he shouted, getting the attention of deckhand who was busy shoveling coal into the furnace. "Grab whatever tools you've got."
"Aye, Captain," the man replied, setting down his shovel and grabbing a spanner and a screwdriver.
Jonathan headed back into the gale. Wind whipped around him, and the deck shifted dangerously as they careened downward. He swallowed his fear and headed for the first sheet of plate metal. His gloved hands were shaking, but he grabbed his borrowed tools and began unbolting, pausing only to regain his balance when she deck tilted suddenly.
The deckhand joined him, and they combined their efforts to remove the heavy sheet. Finally, it came loose. They hoisted it overboard and watched it tumble off the side of the ship. It clattered on the street below, the sound echoing powerfully.
“One down, one hundred and ninety-nine more to go,” Jonathan remarked.
“We’re going to crash, aren’t we, Captain?” said the deckhand. “It’ll take far too long to remove all the shields.”
Jonathan’s heart was slamming against his chest. He was shivering against the cold and sweating from his exertions. His fingers were numb. “Come on, let’s get the next panel,” he said.
The rest of the crew was busy with the same task. With impressive efficiency, they unbolted the metal sheets and sent them careening to the ground below. Gradually, very gradually, their descent began to slow. They were still going down, but they might be able to make a controlled descent.
“Let’s get rid of some extra weight!” he heard Ollie’s voice through the speaking tubes. “Kas, keep firing those cannons until you’re out of lead. Henri-Charles, if you’ve still got ammunition in that Maxim gun, use it.”
“Aye, sir!” they shouted their replies.
Jonathan was sure if he survived this, he’d be shouting for the rest of his life. His ears were ringing, as the cannon and machine gun fire resumed. It was answered by the unearthly wail of the abomination. He saw the creature rear its head, and Henri-Charles unleashed the last of his bullets into the insect’s thick carapace.
Abandoning his task, Jonathan ran across the deck, over to Dr. Sound, who still stood in the doorway of the cabin.
“Care to make yourself useful, Doctor?” he asked.
The doctor snorted. “Thought you’d never ask. What do you want me to do?”
“I want you to toss those grenades into that thing’s ugly maw. Let’s kill this thing, once and for all.”
Sound looked at him the way he might have looked at a mental patient. Then, as he watched the beast open its mouth and scream again as it smashed through the walls of a house, he nodded. He handed one of the grenades to Jonathan.
“Do you have a match?” he asked. “We need something to light the fuse.”
Jonathan reached into his pockets and came out with a matchbook. “I know we’ve had our differences, Doctor, but try not to get yourself killed.”
“I’ll bear that advice in mind, Mr. Grimmer,” Dr. Sound replied.
They crossed the deck, climbing over splintered timber to arrive at the prow of the ship, where the creature’s hungry jaws opened before them. Jonathan’s blood ran cold. This was the closest he’d been to the creature. Its mouth was big enough to swallow him whole, but worse than that, its face was beginning to rot from the effects of the Lazarus Virus. Its stench was stifling. Jonathan had once come across the rotting carcass of a whale that was beached on the shores of the Mediterranean; this was worse than that by far. He stared into its many-lensed eyes, and the beast looked back at him.
Sheltering the match against the wind, he struck a match and lit the fuse.
“Toss it,” Dr. Sound urged.
“Open wide, you ugly bastard!” Jonathan shouted, hurling the hand grenade.
It only took a moment. The grenade sailed into the creature’s open jaws. The concussive blast of the grenade was accompanied by the sickening crunch of splintering carapace; a blast of flame erupted from the monster’s mouth, taking with it a significant section of the cockroach’s head, which rained down in enormous, wet chunks.
Jonathan shouted in alarm when he was struck by a particularly large segment of gruesome flesh. He lost his balance and hit the deck. Still on a slant due to its missing ballonet, the deck was steep enough that Jonathan began to slide. He careened toward the edge of the ship, grasping for something, anything. His hands banged and slid against the splintered wood and slammed into the iron struts that held the metal plating, cutting gashes into his arms and legs.
He slammed into the side of the ship and toppled overboard. He felt open air, screamed. Then just as suddenly, something caught him by the arm. His momentum carried him forward; he slammed into the side of a building, the air going out of him with a solid whump.  His shoulder nearly ripped out of its socket, but he was alive. He must have been closer to the ground than he’d thought.
As he caught his breath, he looked up and saw what it was that he’d snagged on the way down. A shiny, brass contraption that looked a bit like an arm. It was an arm. The body and face to which it belonged appeared over the edge of the roof. He recognized the pretty but scarred face with its clockwork eye, red hair, and light freckles.
“Annabel?” Jonathan said, with a start.
Annabel beamed. With a grunt of effort, she lifted him up and helped him onto the rooftop. “Hello, Jonathan. Nice of you to drop in.”</Text>
            <Notes>She was sure there must be some sort of nautical term for it—she’d overheard the crewmen bandying words like starboard and aft about—but she hadn’t any idea what the appropriate word might be, but the balloon was attached to the ship both by ropes and by huge towers of wood and brass. Some of these towers had footholds build in, and railings along the sides, so they could be climbed in order to perform maintenance duties upon the ship. It was unlikely that they were meant to be used while the ship was flying, in reverse, at top speed.
She swore. She could still hear through the din of battle, the sound of bullets striking metal, and more unsettling than that, the noise of metal bending and warping beneath the pressure of hundreds of bullets fired in succession.
She made her way to the ladder, if that’s what it was called, grabbed the railing, and began to climb. The tower wasn’t shielded by armor either, but there was no time to even think about that just now. Or to think about her fear of heights. She hoisted herself up onto the canvas blimp, and lay flat upon it. There were no railings up here, no handholds, and little to shield her from the wind.
The sail along the balloon’s spine had been lowered, and the shields had been raised. A grid of metal framed the canvas blimp, and sheets of armor plating were affixed in segments, attached to the metal frame in order to cover the gaps between each metal section of the frame. Each gap was about two meters square, but there were spaces that were not entirely covered. The shields were mounted on mechanical arms along the frame, intended to mitigate the risk provided by the gaps in the armor. The ship’s design was built on redundancies. Where the armor failed, the shields would still provide cover.

            <Title>Scene 81</Title>
            <Synopsis>Roderick kills Anthony Tidkins. The Resurrectionists let the zombies out, and Annabel, Palmer, and Roderick make a stand. They manage to get in to the lab, but they are trapped there.</Synopsis>
            <Text>It was Roderick Steen who stood before Annabel. His gun was aimed at the spot where Tidkins had been, and a cloud of smoke trailed from the muzzle. Roderick’s teeth were gritted, his eyes narrowed and fiercely focused on Tidkins’ body. He seemed to be blinking back tears.
“That was for Rémy,” he said.
Annabel’s knees threatened to buckle, and tears formed in her eye, but she managed to keep herself upright. She wanted to launch herself at Roderick and tear his throat out, though all he’d done was the very thing she’d wanted to do herself. She growled in frustration, unable to say a word to Roderick, even to acknowledge his presence.
Finally, she returned her attention to Mr. Palmer, who was beginning to regain consciousness.
“Let me up,” he was saying, as Annabel fought to recover her nerves and steadied herself. “You’ve got to let me up.”
He was gesturing towards something off in the distance. She blinked the tears from her eyes and looked. There were zombies staggering down the hallway, heading towards them.
She cursed. “Where the hell did they come from?”
“Resurrectionist Emergency Protocol D,” said Palmer. “If the facility is compromised, they open the cages as a diversionary tactic.”
“They have zombies in cages?” asked Roderick.
Still, Annabel refused to look at him. Wiping the blood from her face, she let Palmer up. “If it comes down to it, I won’t hesitate to shoot you,” she warned him.
Palmer got to his feet, a little worse for wear. He rubbed his injured jaw.
Annabel tried not to think about Anthony Tidkins, or to look at his body. There was no time to mourn or to think about it. The zombies were coming, and they were surprisingly fast for walking corpses, converging upon them from both directions. There was not nearly enough ammunition to deal with all of them.
She tried the door to the Beta Laboratory, but the scientists must have locked it behind them. She banged on the door. She cursed as she scanned the hallway for another door. There wasn’t one, at least not between them and the zombies, and it would take too long to pick the lock without her tools.
“We’ll have to make a stand,” said Palmer.
“I don’t like our odds,” she said, banging on the door again.
When no one answered it, she raised the pistol. There was nothing else for it but to put as many bullets in their skulls as they could, and then fight their way out with their bare hands.
Annabel closed her eye, relying on the prosthesis for her vision, squeezed the trigger, and one of them fell to the floor. He disappeared under the sea of zombies, who climbed over him without seeming to slow.
She aimed and fired again with deadly accuracy, moved the revolver half an inch to the left, pulled the trigger again. Without pause, she fired into their midst, one bullet at a time. Each bullet hit its mark, but it was not enough. They continued to advance, their numbers practically unaffected by the onslaught of bullets.
“There’s too many of them,” she said.
“Just keep shooting,” Roderick shouted back.
They were inches away from each other, but the sounds of gunfire ricocheting down the hallway and the carnivorous moans of the zombies were deafening.
Palmer grunted, kicking at the doorknob to the laboratory with all his might. If they couldn’t pick the lock, maybe he could break it down. It was up to Annabel and Roderick to buy him enough time.
Annabel aimed again, pulled the trigger, and fired her last bullet. She hadn’t been counting, and only realized she was out when she fired again and heard the hollow click of an empty chamber.
She stuffed the gun back into her holster, and looked to Palmer. The latch still hadn’t broken. The zombies were almost upon them.
Roderick still had a few bullets left, but he wasn’t the marksman Annabel was. She watched him waste three bullets just to put one zombie down. She was about to ask him to hand over his gun, but before she had the chance, he ran out of bullets too.
There were still hundreds of zombies and there was nowhere to go.
“This is it,” she said.
She rolled up her sleeve, revealing her bare, mechanical arm, and gave it a twist of the key. It clicked like clockwork as it wound, but the sound was all but drowned out by the snarling of the dead.
She marched forward, towards the zombies.
“What are you doing?” Palmer grunted.
“Just get that damned door open,” she shouted back.
She grabbed the first of them by the face, careful not to let his jaws seize upon her hands, and slammed his face into the wall. His skull cracked, and he dropped him to the floor. She stomped on his head for good measure, and caved in the next man’s face with a wicked right hook from her brass hand, all in one swift motion.
Roderick seemed suitably impressed, as he let out a whoop of joy and applauded her efforts.
“Don’t get too excited,” she said. “It’s not over yet.”
Already, another zombie was grabbing at her, this time from behind. She grabbed his arms as if to fling him over her back, using his momentum against him, but his body was rotten. His arms popped out of their sockets with a nasty plop, the skin and meat ripping from his rotting limbs like a snake sloughing off its skin.
“Sorry,” Roderick replied, “It’s just that I’m not used to fighting beside anybody remotely competent. No offense intended to Inspectors Hargrave and Taggert, god rest their souls.”
Annabel grinned. It was difficult, in the heat of battle, to remain angry at him. “Why, Mr. Steen, if I didn’t know you better, I’d say that sounded like a compliment.”
She dropped one of the arms, but she held onto the other, brandishing it like a weapon.
She whirled around to face the zombie, and recognized him. This was the creature from the tank. He was beyond rotten. He was wet, soggy even. No wonder his arms had ripped out so easily. She raised his limb and swung it at his skull, knocking him over.
He twitched on the ground, trying to get up, but Annabel didn’t let up. She stood over him and used his own arm to cave in his skull.
“Very neatly done, Miss Monday,” Roderick called.
Beside her, Roderick had drawn his swordstick and was doing a decent enough job of hacking at the zombies, cleaving their faces apart with neat thrusts of the sword.
“You’re not bad at that, yourself,” she told him.
She was honestly surprised. While Roderick exuded confidence and had the poised, refined manner of an English dandy, she hadn’t expected that fighting zombies would be his forté. She’d half expected him to cower in the corner while she did the hard work.
“I’ve trained in bartitsu,” he replied, even as he grunted with the effort of slicing through a zombie’s legs. “Not to mention fencing. My father was rather determined to make a proper man out of me.”
“Is that what makes a proper man? Sports?”
“My father seemed to think so,” Roderick answered, thrusting his sword into the eye socket of a zombie that had grasped Annabel by the hair. “And what do you think makes a man?”
“Thank you,” she said, as she returned the favor, fending off a zombie that had its fingers on Roderick’s arm. “And to answer your question, typically smaller breasts and the freedom from having to wear corsets and bustle skirts are about the only things of any significance that distinguish men from women.”
“Well, if men didn’t insist that women wear corsets and bustle skirts, how else would we slow you down?” Roderick wondered.
He breathed heavily with the effort of sweeping out the legs of a particularly large zombie. As the creature crashed to the floor, Annabel finished him off with a solid blow to the head with her mechanical fist. She tried to lift her arm again, but it seized up.
“Buy me some time,” she said. “I need to wind my gears.”
She backed into a corner, quickly gave her arm a turn of the key, and flexed her mechanical fingers to test it. It didn’t always require such extensive maintenance, but she didn’t always put it to such heavy use. She rejoined the fight just in time to pull one of the zombies from Roderick’s shoulders.
“How are we doing, Palmer?” she called.
Even as Annabel continued to fight, heart pounding as she kicked at the nearest walking cadaver, she heard Palmer’s voice, rising above the din.
“It’s open!”
She hurried to the door, ripping out the trachea of the nearest zombie fiend that assailed her in order to disengage from the fight. She landed a devastating blow with her mechanical arm that knocked its head clean off.
Still, she had to fight her way through the mob, as the zombies moved clumsily in their efforts to sink their teeth into her flesh. At last, she found the open doorway and practically fell through it. Roderick was right behind her.
Remarkably, Annabel was unscathed. She heaved, struggling against her corset for breath, as Roderick launched himself bodily at the door. It slammed, but it wouldn’t shut. Several cadaverous limbs jammed in the door, their fingers still grasping for living flesh. Palmer added his weight to the door, and together the men strained against it. Still, the door thudded inward, threatening to cave beneath the combined weight of the zombies on the other side.
“We can’t hold it,” Roderick grunted.
The door shuddered again. With every bang against it, the door creaked open a bit further. There was nothing they could do to stop it. Eventually, the zombies would get in. They were trapped in here.</Text>
            <Notes>The scientists looked alarmed, but did not intervene as Annabel hurried to help. She set herself against the door, but even the two of them could not hold it closed for long.
“A knife!” Annabel shouted at the alarmed scientists. “Or something sharp. Do you have one?”
Stunned into inaction, they simply stared at her in silence.
“Now!” she bellowed.
At last, Dr. Jekyll hurried to find a tool from off the shelf, something sharp. Finally, he presented her with a long, jagged knife of surgical steel.
“Will this do?” he asked.
She grabbed the knife, and whistled appreciatively.
She hesitated, looking at Palmer as she assessed the situation.
“Another one for Mr. Palmer, if you would be so kind?”
Then, leaving Palmer and Roderick to keep the door shut, she positioned herself with knife raised, at the door’s edge. Palmer would have to make due with a scalpel, as that was all the scientist had given him.
“Ready?” Annabel asked.
Palmer gave Annabel a nod.
“Ready,” said Roderick.
They stepped back from the doorway and raised their weapons.</Notes>

            <Title>Scene 27</Title>
            <Text>Henry Charles’ words rang in Jonathan’s ears. We’re too late.
The creature standing before Jonathan was one of the zombies Parson Sinews had spoken of, a product of the Dead London Project. The Resurrectionists had succeeded. They had brought the dead to life.
The big Haitian was first to react. Jonathan just stared blankly, watching in fascinated horror as the zombie got to its feet. It was growling at him, spit running down its chin like a rabid dog. Suddenly, it went quiet.
It lunged, snapping its teeth at Jonathan’s neck. Henry Charles moved, blindingly quick, slamming his fist into the side of the zombie’s skull. The creature hit the ground hard. Jonathan’s heart pounded; if Henry Charles hadn’t intervened, the zombie would have torn into his throat with its teeth.
The creature didn’t stay down long. Almost immediately, it staggered to its feet, undeterred. Again, it tried for Jonathan’s neck again. This time, Jonathan snapped into action. He grabbed the zombie by the cuffs of its shirt, keeping its snapping teeth at bay. He shoved the zombie away from him, causing it to stagger back. Then he drew his pistol.
He aimed it at the zombie.
“Stop right there,” he warned. “We’re trying to help you.”
Again, the zombie staggered forward. Jonathan stepped back and cocked the pistol. “Step back or I will shoot!”
The zombie snarled and continued toward him. Jonathan looked at Ocelot.
“Shoot him,” Ocelot urged.
Jonathan hesitated.
“He’s just disoriented. He needs our help.”
Ocelot snorted. “There is no helping him, Mr. Grimmer. He is a dead man walking.”
Again, the zombie lurched toward Jonathan, this time trying to grab hold of him with rotten hands. Ocelot hit the creature again, hard, this time striking at the base of the zombie’s skull. Blood spilled as the zombie hit the pavement. Ocelot wiped his hand on his coat, leaving a trail of blood and brain.
This time, the zombie didn’t get up.
“You killed him,” Jonathan said, breathless.
“He would have killed you,” Ocelot told him.
“He was sick,” Jonathan said.
Ocelot looked up at Jonathan’s airship, then back at Jonathan. “Yes, Mr. Grimmer. He was sick. And I don’t think you’d want to catch what he’s got. If he’d managed to bite you…”
Jonathan sighed. “You’re right,” he admitted at last.
“Get to your airship, Mr. Grimmer. Get out of the city if you can.”
Not a bad idea. In fact, there was nothing Jonathan would have liked to do more than to climb back to the safety of his airship, pour himself another glass of absinthe, and set off for Paris, or Madrid, or anywhere just to get out of this god-forsaken city. The old Jonathan would have done exactly that. But this Jonathan? This Jonathan had a responsibility to this city.
There were probably only a handful of people who knew about the Lazarus Virus—what it was, why people had been infected with it, and how. He was also among the few who knew who was responsible. The Resurrection Man, who he believed was still at large in spite of Parson Sinews’ arrest. Not only that, Jonathan had only just learned that the Resurrectionists had probably killed his father. He couldn’t leave. Not now.  Not with so much at stake. He needed to find the Resurrectionists. Solomon Grundy. Mr. Hyde. Anthony Tidkins. They had unleashed this experiment. Perhaps they could put an end to it. And if not, at least they could be brought to justice for their crimes.
“You should come with me,” he said.
“I need to find Mr. Sinews,” Ocelot replied.
“Right. Well, I suppose you would. Take care, Mr. Ocelot.”
He signaled to the airship, and started off as the crew lowered the rope ladder.
“You too, Mr. Grimmer,” Ocelot called.
Without looking back, Jonathan grabbed a hold of the first rung of the ladder, and without a word, he began to climb.</Text>

            <Text>Annabel Grey had her arms full. In her left, a ring of keys to the cabins aboard the passenger steamboat Lady Bronte, and in the right, an enormous trunk that should have taken two men to carry. The passengers to whom the trunk belonged gaped at her as she lifted it easily and marched toward the end of the pier.
Annabel had traded in her fine clothes for the dockyard scrubs she now sported. Dirty trousers, plain shirt stained with grease, the sleeves rolled up, a tweed vest over that. She wore a cap on her head, and tattoos on her left bicep. Some of the ink was fresh, and still tender.
Her right arm, by contrast, was all polished brass and leather straps. Pistons pumped and gears rotated as she flexed her metal bicep and climbed the steps of the steamship. The mechanical prosthesis was clamped into surgical implants in the stump of her arm—the garish scars where the fleshy part of her arm ended were a brutal reminder of how she’d lost the arm all those years ago. Bitten and ravaged by the living dead, amputated by Anthony Tidkins.
If Annabel never saw another zombie again, she would die a happy woman. This was just one of the reasons Annabel had ended up at the dockyards in Gravesend. The once-sleepy port town of Gravesend had boomed after London was overtaken by the zombies. It was now a flourishing city, populated by tourists and refugees alike, and its dockyards were among the busiest along the Thames. A dozen steamboats like the Lady Bronte were docked here, not to mention the airships in the shipyard on the other side of town. With the sound of seagulls in the sky, and the bustle of passengers and dock-workers, Annabel just prayed the town would be spared from London’s fate. She didn’t know how they got out, but they did; every so often she’d hear stories of a zombie wandering into town and taking someone by surprise. Annabel wouldn’t be caught by surprise. She was keeping her ear to the ground. She wasn’t looking for zombies though. She was looking for Resurrectionists.
She stepped off the pier and headed up the ramp to board the ship.
“Where should I put this, eh, guv?” she asked. After years spent mastering the refined speech of a lady, she’d abandoned it entirely in order to pass as a dock worker.
“They’ve given us Cabin Number Twelve,” the gentleman answered.
“Twelve, twelve, ah, here it is,” she said, finding a key with the number twelve.
She slid the key into the lock and opened the door. Cabin twelve turned out to be one of the master suites, a lavishly decorated room lined with gilt and floral-patterned furniture, a smoking room, a lady’s powder room, and a king size bed.
“In the bedroom?” she asked.
“Yes, yes, the bedroom will do,” said the gentleman.
“Right you are, guv, I’ll just let ya get settled then,” she said, plunking down the trunk in the bedroom.
Once she was out of sight, she quickly popped open the lock, making use of the lock-picking kit she’d had installed in her arm, courtesy of a mechanic she’d met a year earlier in Dartford. She had a quick rummage through the family’s belongings. There was nothing to connect the family to the Resurrectionists, so the mission was a bust, but she did come across a diamond necklace, which she tucked into her trousers. Not bad for an honest day’s work, she thought. Well, not an honest day’s work, but still…
She didn’t feel guilty stealing from them. People like them, they had enough money she doubted they’d even miss the necklace. To someone of Annabel’s station in life, they were worth a fortune. And besides, they weren’t for her.
She closed the trunk, locked it, and slid it into the corner of the room. 
“Right then, if that’ll be all…”
“Yes, thank you,” said the man, trying not to stare at her arm. “May I just ask—”
“I wouldn’t,” Annabel told him. “No disrespect, mister, but I don’t care to talk about it.”
“Of course.” He smiled awkwardly, then handed her a ha’penny for her trouble.
She pocketed the coin and hurried from the room.
That was when she heard it. Never had she heard such a horrendous sound, an awful screeching wail that made her clench her teeth. She nearly had to cover her ears.
“Wot the bleedin’ ’ell was that?” she exclaimed.
“‘Aven’t the foggiest,” said another of the dock workers, a rough-looking bearded fellow she’d seen around the docks before. She thought his name might be Bill, but she couldn’t remember for certain.
“Shall we have a look?”
She hurried outside. Already, the scene was chaos. Abandoning their luggage, passengers were fighting their way off the pier, elbowing each other out of the way or even diving into the Thames to get away. Some of them were pointing up at the sky.
Annabel followed their pointing fingers to the spot in the sky.
At first, she thought it was an airship. When she realized what it really was, she suddenly felt feverishly cold. Her mouth opened. She turned to Bill, who had followed her out onto the pier. “Run,” she said.
“What?” he said.
She pointed at the sky. There was a creature, bigger than a whale, airborne, insect-like in appearance, with long antennae and a sleek, dark brown carapace. Like her, it was part machine, armed with a twin pair of machine guns. Its guts had been hollowed out and replaced with the husk of an airship. There were people inside.
“Run,” she repeated. “For the love of god, run.”</Text>
            <Comments>Annabel seems interesting, but I don't have much empathy for thieves, so I have a hard time connecting with her.
- Danny
As a reader, I felt like that passage was cheap. Kudos on immediately giving me enough in the opening of the next scene to guess what Annabel saw, but still, I felt cheesed on two levels. First of all, not telling the reader what she saw feels like a gimmick, and gimmicks turn me off as a reader. Second, her reaction, when disassociated from the stimulus, is another lost opportunity (in my opinion) to form an empathetic connection between reader and character. If I can see her react to a stimulus like a human, I'm more likely to care about her because I generally care about humans on a basic level. But since I have no idea what she is reacting to, I am robbed of the ability to share the experience with her, and thereby form an empathetic connection.
And furthermore, come on. It's a steam-driven cyborg bug. Like the reader isn't going to read on to find out more about that. The faux cliffhanger just isn't necessary, in my opinion.

Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) was an Italian polymath, regarded as the epitome of the "Renaissance Man", displaying skills in numerous diverse areas of study. Whilst most famous for his paintings such as the Mona Lisa and the Last Supper, Leonardo is also renowned in the fields of civil engineering, chemistry, geology, geometry, hydrodynamics, mathematics, mechanical engineering, optics, physics, pyrotechnics, and zoology.
While the full extent of his scientific studies has only become recognized in the last 150 years, he was, during his lifetime, employed for his engineering and skill of invention. Many of his designs, such as the movable dikes to protect Venice from invasion, proved too costly or impractical. Some of his smaller inventions entered the world of manufacturing unheralded. As an engineer, Leonardo conceived ideas vastly ahead of his own time, conceptually inventing a helicopter, a tank, the use of concentrated solar power, a calculator, a rudimentary theory of plate tectonics and the double hull. In practice, he greatly advanced the state of knowledge in the fields of anatomy, astronomy, civil engineering, optics, and the study of water (hydrodynamics).
Leonardo's most famous drawing, the Vitruvian Man, is a study of the proportions of the human body, linking art and science in a single work that has come to represent Renaissance Humanism.

Condensed biography[edit]
￼
￼
The Arno Valley
Main article: Leonardo da Vinci
This is a brief summary of Leonardo's early life and journals with particular emphasis on his introduction to science.
Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (April 15, 1452 – May 2, 1519) was born the illegitimate son of Messer Piero, a notary, and Caterina, a peasant woman. His early life was spent in the region of Vinci, in the valley of the Arno River near Florence, firstly with his mother and in later childhood in the household of his father, grandfather and uncle Francesco.
His curiosity and interest in scientific observation were stimulated by his uncle Francesco, while his grandfather's keeping of journals set an example which he was to follow for most of his life, diligently recording in his own journals both the events of the day, his visual observations, his plans and his projects. The journals of Leonardo contain matters as mundane as grocery lists and as remarkable as diagrams for the construction of a flying machine.
In 1466, Leonardo was sent to Florence to the workshop of the artist Verrocchio, in order to learn the skills of an artist. At the workshop, as well as painting and drawing, he learnt the study of topographical anatomy.[1] He was also exposed to a very wide range of technical skills such as drafting, set construction, plasterworking, paint chemistry, and metallurgy.
￼
￼
From Leonardo's journals - studies of an old man and the action of water.
Among the older artists whose work stimulated Leonardo's scientific interest was Piero della Francesca, then a man in his 60s, who was one of the earliest artists to systematically employ linear perspective in his paintings, and who had a greater understanding of the science of light than any other artist of his date. While Leonardo's teacher, Verrocchio, largely ignored Piero's scientifically disciplined approach to painting, Leonardo and Domenico Ghirlandaio, who also worked at Verrocchio's workshop, did not. Two of Leonardo's earliest paintings, both scenes of the Annunciation show his competent understanding of the linear perspective.
Leonardo was profoundly observant of nature, his curiosity having been stimulated in early childhood by his discovery of a deep cave in the mountains and his intense desire to know what lay inside. His earliest dated drawing, 1473, is of the valley of the Arno River, where he lived. It displays some of the many scientific interests that were to obsess him all his life, in particular geology and hydrology. [2]
Approach to scientific investigation[edit]
￼
￼
Studies of a fœtus from Leonardo's journals
During the Renaissance, the study of art and science was not perceived as mutually exclusive; on the contrary, the one was seen as informing upon the other. Although Leonardo's training was primarily as an artist, it was largely through his scientific approach to the art of painting, and his development of a style that coupled his scientific knowledge with his unique ability to render what he saw that created the outstanding masterpieces of art for which he is famous.
As a scientist, Leonardo had no formal education in Latin and mathematics and did not attend a university. Because of these factors, his scientific studies were largely ignored by other scholars. Leonardo's approach to science was one of intense observation and detailed recording, his tools of investigation being almost exclusively his eyes. His journals give insight into his investigative processes.
A recent and exhaustive analysis of Leonardo as a scientist by Fritjof Capra argues that Leonardo was a fundamentally different kind of scientist from Galileo, Newton, and other scientists who followed him, his theorizing and hypothesizing integrating the arts and particularly painting. Capra sees Leonardo's unique integrated, holistic views of science as making him a forerunner of modern systems theory and complexity schools of thought.[3]

Leonardo's notes and journals[edit]
Leonardo kept a series of journals in which he wrote almost daily, as well as separate notes and sheets of observations, comments and plans. He wrote and drew with his left hand, and most of his writing is in mirror script, which makes it difficult to read. Much has survived to illustrate Leonardo's studies, discoveries and inventions.
On his death, his writings were left mainly to his pupil Melzi with the apparent intention that his scientific work should be published. This did not take place in Melzi's lifetime, and the writings were eventually bound in different forms and dispersed. Some of his works were published as a Treatise on Painting 165 years after his death.
Publication[edit]
Leonardo illustrated a book on mathematical proportion in art written by his friend Luca Pacioli and called "De divina proportione", published in 1509. He was also preparing a major treatise on his scientific observations and mechanical inventions. It was to be divided into a number of sections or "Books", Leonardo leaving some instructions as to how they were to be ordered. Many sections for it appear in his notebooks.
These pages deal with scientific subjects generally but also specifically as they touch upon the creation of artworks. In relating to art, this is not science that is dependent upon experimentation or the testing of theories. It deals with detailed observation, particularly the observation of the natural world, and includes a great deal about the visual effects of light on different natural substances such as foliage.[4]
Leonardo writes:
“
Begun at Florence, in the house of Piero di Braccio Martelli, on the 22nd day of March 1508. And this is to be a collection without order, taken from many papers which I have copied here, hoping to arrange them later each in its place, according to the subjects of which they may treat. But I believe that before I am at the end of this [task] I shall have to repeat the same things several times; for which, O reader! do not blame me, for the subjects are many and memory cannot retain them [all] and say: ‘I will not write this because I wrote it before.’ And if I wished to avoid falling into this fault, it would be necessary in every case when I wanted to copy [a passage] that, not to repeat myself, I should read over all that had gone before; and all the more since the intervals are long between one time of writing and the next.[4]
”
Natural science[edit]
￼
￼
Study of the graduations of light and shade on a sphere (chiaroscuro).
Light[edit]
“
The lights which may illuminate opaque bodies are of 4 kinds. These are: diffused light as that of the atmosphere... And Direct, as that of the sun... The third is Reflected light; and there is a 4th which is that which passes through [translucent] bodies, as linen or paper or the like.[4]
”
￼
￼
The Lady with an Ermine
For an artist working in the 15th century, some study of the nature of light was essential. It was by the effective painting of light falling on a surface that modelling, or a three dimensional appearance was to be achieved in a two-dimensional medium. It was also well understood by artists like Leonardo's teacher, Verrocchio, that an appearance of space and distance could be achieved in a background landscape by painting in tones that were less in contrast and colours that were less bright than in the foreground of the painting. The effects of light on solids were achieved by trial and error, since few artists except Piero della Francesca actually had accurate scientific knowledge of the subject.
At the time when Leonardo commenced painting, it was unusual for figures to be painted with extreme contrast of light and shade. Faces, in particular, were shadowed in a manner that was bland and maintained all the features and contours clearly visible. Leonardo broke with this. In the painting generally titled The Lady with an Ermine (about 1483) he sets the figure diagonally to the picture space and turns her head so that her face is almost parallel to her nearer shoulder. The back of her head and the further shoulder are deeply shadowed. Around the ovoid solid of her head and across her breast and hand the light is diffused in such a way that the distance and position of the light in relation to the figure can be calculated.
Leonardo's treatment of light in paintings such as The Virgin of the Rocks and the Mona Lisa was to change forever the way in which artists perceived light and used it in their paintings. Of all Leonardo's scientific legacies, this is probably the one that had the most immediate and noticeable effect.
Human anatomy[edit]
“
...to obtain a true and perfect knowledge [of the vascular system]... I have dissected more than ten human bodies, destroying all the other members, and removing the very minutest particles of the flesh by which these veins are surrounded, ... and as one single body would not last so long, since it was necessary to proceed with several bodies by degrees, until I came to an end and had a complete knowledge; this I repeated twice, to learn the differences...[4]
”
￼
￼
Study of the proportions of the head.
Topographic anatomy[edit]
Leonardo began the formal study of the topographical anatomy of the human body when apprenticed to Andrea del Verrocchio. As a student he would have been taught to draw the human body from life, to memorize the muscles, tendons and visible subcutaneous structure and to familiarise himself with the mechanics of the various parts of the skeletal and muscular structure. It was common workshop practice to have plaster casts of parts of the human anatomy available for students to study and draw.
￼
￼
Two anatomical studies
If, as is thought to be the case, Leonardo painted the torso and arms of Christ in The Baptism of Christ on which he famously collaborated with his master Verrocchio, then his understanding of topographical anatomy had surpassed that of his master at an early age as can be seen by a comparison of the arms of Christ with those of John the Baptist in the same painting.
In the 1490s he wrote about demonstrating muscles and sinews to students:
“
Remember that to be certain of the point of origin of any muscle, you must pull the sinew from which the muscle springs in such a way as to see that muscle move, and where it is attached to the ligaments of the bones.[4]
”
His continued investigations in this field occupied many pages of notes, each dealing systematically with a particular aspect of anatomy. It appears that the notes were intended for publication, a task entrusted on his death to his pupil Melzi.
In conjunction with studies of aspects of the body are drawings of faces displaying different emotions and many drawings of people suffering facial deformity, either congenital or through illness. Some of these drawings, generally referred to as "caricatures", on analysis of the skeletal proportions, appear to be based on anatomical studies.
Dissection[edit]
￼
￼
Dissection of the skull.
As Leonardo became successful as an artist, he was given permission to dissect human corpses at the hospital Santa Maria Nuova in Florence. Later he dissected in Milan at the hospital Maggiore and in Rome at the hospital Santo Spirito (the first mainland Italian hospital). From 1510 to 1511 he collaborated in his studies with the doctor Marcantonio della Torre.
“
I have removed the skin from a man who was so shrunk by illness that the muscles were worn down and remained in a state like thin membrane, in such a way that the sinews instead of merging in muscles ended in wide membrane; and where the bones were covered by the skin they had very little over their natural size.[4]
”
In 30 years, Leonardo dissected 30 male and female corpses of different ages. Together with Marcantonio, he prepared to publish a theoretical work on anatomy and made more than 200 drawings. However, his book was published only in 1680 (161 years after his death) under the heading Treatise on painting.
￼
￼
The organs of a woman's body.
Among the detailed images that Leonardo drew are many studies of the human skeleton. He was the first to describe the double S form of the backbone. He also studied the inclination of pelvis and sacrum and stressed that sacrum was not uniform, but composed of five fused vertebrae.
Leonardo was a physiologist as well as an anatomist, studying the function of the human body as well as examining and recording its structure. He dissected and drew the human skull and cross-sections of the brain, transversal, sagittal, and frontal. These drawings may be linked to a search for the sensus communis, the locus of the human senses,[citation needed] which, by Medieval tradition, was located at the exact physical center of the skull.
Leonardo studied internal organs, being the first to draw the human appendix and the lungs, mesentery, urinary tract, reproductive organs, the muscles of the cervix and a detailed cross-section of coitus. He was one of the first to draw a scientific representation of the fetus in the intrautero.
Leonardo studied the vascular system and drew a dissected heart in detail. He correctly worked out how heart valves ebb the flow of blood yet he did not fully understand circulation as he believed that blood was pumped to the muscles where it was consumed. In 2005 a UK heart surgeon, Francis Wells, from Papworth Hospital Cambridge, pioneered repair to damaged hearts, using Leonardo's depiction of the opening phase of the mitral valve to operate without changing its diameter allowing an individual to recover more quickly. Wells said "Leonardo had a depth of appreciation of the anatomy and physiology of the body - its structure and function - that perhaps has been overlooked by some."[5]
Leonardo's observational acumen, drawing skill, and the clarity of depiction of bone structures reveal him at his finest as an anatomist. However, his depiction of the internal soft tissues of the body are incorrect in many ways, showing that he maintained concepts of anatomy and functioning that were in some cases millennia old, and that his investigations were probably hampered by the lack of preservation techniques available at the time. Leonardo's detailed drawing of the internal organs of a woman (See left) reveal many traditional misconceptions.[6]
Leonardo's study of human anatomy led also to the design of the first known robot in recorded history. The design, which has come to be called Leonardo's robot, was probably made around the year 1495 but was rediscovered only in the 1950s.
Comparative anatomy[edit]
￼
￼
Comparison of the leg of a man and a dog.
Leonardo not only studied human anatomy, but the anatomy of many other animals as well. He dissected cows, birds, monkeys and frogs, comparing in his drawings their anatomical structure with that of humans. On one page of his journal Leonardo drew five profile studies of a horse with its teeth bared in anger and, for comparison, a snarling lion and a snarling man.
“
I have found that in the composition of the human body as compared with the bodies of animals, the organs of sense are duller and coarser... I have seen in the Lion tribe that the sense of smell is connected with part of the substance of the brain which comes down the nostrils, which form a spacious receptacle for the sense of smell, which enters by a great number of cartilaginous vesicles with several passages leading up to where the brain, as before said, comes down.[4]
”
In the early 1490s Leonardo was commissioned to create a monument in honour of Francesco Sforza. In his notebooks are a series of plans for an equestrian monument. There are also a large number of related anatomical studies of horses. They include several diagrams of a standing horse with the angles and proportions annotated, anatomical studies of horses' heads, a dozen detailed drawings of hooves and numerous studies and sketches of horses rearing.
He studied the topographical anatomy of a bear in detail, making many drawings of its paws. There is also a drawing of the muscles and tendons of the bear's hind feet. Other drawings of particular interest include the uterus of a pregnant cow, the hindquarters of a decrepit mule and studies of the musculature of a little dog.
Botany[edit]
“
All the branches of a tree at every stage of its height when put together are equal in thickness to the trunk [below them].[4]
”
The science of botany was long established by Leonardo's time, a treatise on the subject having been written as early as 300 BCE.[7] Leonardo's study of plants, resulting in many beautiful drawings in his notebooks, was not to record in diagramatic form the parts of the plant, but rather, as an artist and observer to record the precise appearance of plants, the manner of growth and the way that individual plants and flowers of a single variety differed from one another.
￼
￼
Study of sedge
One such study shows a page with several species of flower of which ten drawings are of wild violets. Along with a drawing of the growing plant and a detail of a leaf, Leonardo has repeatedly drawn single flowers from different angles, with their heads set differently on the stem.
Apart from flowers the notebooks contain many drawings of crop plants including several types of grain and a variety of berries including a detailed study of bramble. There are also water plants such as irises and sedge. His notebooks also direct the artist to observe how light reflects from foliage at different distances and under different atmospheric conditions.
A number of the drawings have their equivalents in Leonardo's paintings. An elegant study of a stem of lilies may have been for one of Leonardo's early Annunciation paintings, carried in the hand of the Archangel Gabriel. In both the Annunciation pictures the grass is dotted with blossoming plants.
The plants which appear in both the versions of The Virgin of the Rocks demonstrate the results of Leonardo's studies in a meticulous realism that makes each plant readily identifiable to the botanist.
Geology[edit]
￼
￼
A topographical map.
As an adult, Leonardo had only two childhood memories, one of which was the finding of a cave in the Apennines. Although fearing that he might be attacked by a wild beast, he ventured in driven "by the burning desire to see whether there might be any marvelous thing within."
Leonardo's earliest dated drawing is a study of the Arno Valley, strongly emphasizing its geological features. His notebooks contain landscapes with a wealth of geological observation from the regions of both Florence and Milan, often including atmospheric effects such as a heavy rainstorm pouring down on a town at the foot of a mountain range.
It had been observed for many years that strata in mountains often contained bands of sea shells. Conservative science said that these could be explained by the Great Flood described in the Bible. Leonardo's observations convinced him that this could not possibly be the case.
￼
￼
The Virgin of the Rocks
“
And a little beyond the sandstone conglomerate, a tufa has been formed, where it turned towards Castel Florentino; farther on, the mud was deposited in which the shells lived, and which rose in layers according to the levels at which the turbid Arno flowed into that sea. And from time to time the bottom of the sea was raised, depositing these shells in layers, as may be seen in the cutting at Colle Gonzoli, laid open by the Arno which is wearing away the base of it; in which cutting the said layers of shells are very plainly to be seen in clay of a bluish colour, and various marine objects are found there.[4]
”
This quotation makes clear the breadth of Leonardo's understanding of geology, including the action of water in creating sedimentary rock, the tectonic action of the Earth in raising the sea bed and the action of erosion in the creation of geographical features.
In Leonardo's earliest paintings we see the remarkable attention given to the small landscapes of the background, with lakes and water, swathed in a misty light. In the larger of the Annunciation paintings is a town on the edge of a lake. Although distant, the mountains can be seen to be scored by vertical strata. This characteristic can be observed in other paintings by Leonardo, and closely resembles the mountains around Lago di Garda and Lago d'Iseo in Northern Italy. It is a particular feature of both the paintings of The Virgin of the Rocks, which also include caverns of fractured, tumbled, and water-eroded limestone.[8]
Cartography[edit]
￼
￼
Leonardo's accurate map of Imola for Cesare Borgia.
In the early 16th century maps were rare and often inaccurate. Leonardo produced several extremely accurate maps such as the town plan of Imola created in 1502 in order to win the patronage of Cesare Borgia. Borgia was so impressed that he hired him as a military engineer and architect. Leonardo also produced a map of Chiana Valley in Tuscany, which he surveyed, without the benefit of modern equipment, by pacing the distances. In 1515, Leonardo produced a map of the Roman Southern Coast which is linked to his work for the Vatican and relates to his plans to drain the marshland.
Recent research by Donato Pezzutto suggests that the background landscapes in Leonardo’s paintings depict specific locations as aerial views with enhanced depth, employing a technique called cartographic perspective. Pezzutto identifies the location of the Mona Lisa to the Val di Chiana, the Annunciation to the Arno Valley, the Madonna of the Yarnwinder to the Adda Valley and the Virgin and Child with St Anne and Lamb to the Sessia Valley.[9]
Hydrodynamics[edit]
￼
￼
Studies of water.
“
All the branches of a water [course] at every stage of its course, if they are of equal rapidity, are equal to the body of the main stream.[4]
”
Among Leonardo's drawings are many that are studies of the motion of water, in particular the forms taken by fast-flowing water on striking different surfaces.
Many of these drawings depict the spiralling nature of water. The spiral form had been studied in the art of the Classical era and strict mathematical proportion had been applied to its use in art and architecture. An awareness of these rules of proportion had been revived in the early Renaissance. In Leonardo's drawings can be seen the investigation of the spiral as it occurs in water.
There are several elaborate drawings of water curling over an object placed at a diagonal to its course. There are several drawings of water dropping from a height and curling upwards in spiral forms. One such drawing, as well as curling waves, shows splashes and details of spray and bubbles.
Leonardo's interest manifested itself in the drawing of streams and rivers, the action of water in eroding rocks, and the cataclysmic action of water in floods and tidal waves. The knowledge that he gained from his studies was employed in devising a range of projects, particularly in relation to the Arno River. None of the major works was brought to completion.
Astronomy[edit]
“
The earth is not in the centre of the Sun’s orbit nor at the centre of the universe, but in the centre of its companion elements, and united with them. And any one standing on the moon, when it and the sun are both beneath us, would see this our earth and the element of water upon it just as we see the moon, and the earth would light it as it lights us.[4][10]
”
Alchemy[edit]
Claims are sometimes made that Leonardo da Vinci was an alchemist. He was trained in the workshop of Verrocchio, who according to Vasari, was an able alchemist. Leonardo was a chemist in so much as that he experimented with different media for suspending paint pigment. In the painting of murals, his experiments resulted in notorious failures with the Last Supper deteriorating within a century, and the Battle of Anghiari running off the wall. In Leonardo's many pages of notes about artistic processes, there are some that pertain to the use of silver and gold in artworks, information he would have learnt as a student.[11]
Leonardo's scientific process was based mainly upon observation. His practical experiments are also founded in observation rather than belief. Leonardo, who questioned the order of the solar system and the deposit of fossils by the Great Flood, had little time for the alchemical quests to turn lead into gold or create a potion that gave eternal life.
Leonardo said about alchemists:
“
The false interpreters of nature declare that quicksilver is the common seed of every metal, not remembering that nature varies the seed according to the variety of the things she desires to produce in the world.[4][12]
”
“
Old alchemists... have never either by chance or by experiment succeeded in creating the smallest element that can be created by nature; however [they] deserve unmeasured praise for the usefulness of things invented for the use of men, and would deserve it even more if they had not been the inventors of noxious things like poisons and other similar things which destroy life or mind.[13]
”
“
And many have made a trade of delusions and false miracles, deceiving the stupid multitude.[4]
”
Mathematical studies[edit]
Perspective[edit]
“
The art of perspective is of such a nature as to make what is flat appear in relief and what is in relief flat.[4]
”
During the early 15th century, both Brunelleschi and Alberti made studies of linear perspective. In 1436 Alberti published "della Pittura" ("On Painting"), which includes his findings on linear perspective. Piero della Francesca carried his work forward and by the 1470s a number of artists were able to produce works of art that demonstrated a full understanding of the principles of linear perspective.
￼
￼
Draft of the perspective of the Adoration of the Magi.
Leonardo studied linear perspective and employed it in his earlier paintings. His use of perspective in the two Annunciations is daring, as he uses various features such as the corner of a building, a walled garden and a path to contrast enclosure and spaciousness.
The unfinished Adoration of the Magi was intended to be a masterpiece revealing much of Leonardo's knowledge of figure drawing and perspective. There exists a number of studies that he made, including a detailed study of the perspective, showing the complex background of ruined Classical buildings that he planned for the left of the picture. In addition, Leonardo is credited with the first use of anamorphosis, the use of a "perspective" to produce an image that is intelligible only with a curved mirror or from a specific vantage point.[14]
Leonardo wrote:
“
Those who are in love with practice without knowledge are like the sailor who gets into a ship without rudder or compass and who never can be certain whether he is going. Practice must always be founded on sound theory, and to this Perspective is the guide and the gateway; and without this nothing can be done well in the matter of drawing.[4]
”

The rhombicuboctahedron, as published in De divina proportione.
Geometry[edit]
While in Milan in 1496 Leonardo met a traveling monk and academic, Luca Pacioli. Under him, Leonardo studied mathematics. Pacioli, who first codified and recorded the double entry system of bookkeeping,[15] had already published a major treatise on mathematical knowledge, collaborated with Leonardo in the production of a book called "De divina proportione" about mathematical and artistic proportion. Leonardo prepared a series of drawings of regular solids in a skeletal form to be engraved as plates. "De divina proportione" was published in 1509.
“
All the problems of perspective are made clear by the five terms of mathematicians, which are:—the point, the line, the angle, the superficies and the solid. The point is unique of its kind. And the point has neither height, breadth, length, nor depth, whence it is to be regarded as indivisible and as having no dimensions in space.[4]
”
Engineering and invention[edit]
Vasari in Lives of the Artists says of Leonardo:
“
He made designs for mills, fulling machines and engines that could be driven by water-power... In addition he used to make models and plans showing how to excavate and tunnel through mountains without difficulty, so as to pass from one level to another; and he demonstrated how to lift and draw great weights by means of levers, hoists and winches, and ways of cleansing harbours and using pumps to suck up water from great depths.
”
Practical inventions and projects[edit]
￼
￼
A machine for grinding convex lenses.
Leonardo was a master of mechanical principles. He utilized leverage and cantilevering, pulleys, cranks, gears, including angle gears and rack and pinion gears; parallel linkage, lubrication systems and bearings. He understood the principles governing momentum, centripetal force, friction and the aerofoil and applied these to his inventions. His scientific studies remained unpublished with, for example, his manuscripts describing the processes governing friction predating the introduction of Amontons' Laws of Friction by 150 years.[16]
It is impossible to say with any certainty how many or even which of his inventions passed into general and practical use, and thereby had impact over the lives of many people. Among those inventions that are credited with passing into general practical use are the strut bridge, the automated bobbin winder, the rolling mill, the machine for testing the tensile strength of wire and the lens-grinding machine pictured at right. In the lens-grinding machine, the hand rotation of the grinding wheel operates an angle-gear, which rotates a shaft, turning a geared dish in which sits the glass or crystal to be ground. A single action rotates both surfaces at a fixed speed ratio determined by the gear.
As an inventor, Leonardo was not prepared to tell all that he knew:
“
How by means of a certain machine many people may stay some time under water. How and why I do not describe my method of remaining under water, or how long I can stay without eating; and I do not publish nor divulge these by reason of the evil nature of men who would use them as means of destruction at the bottom of the sea, by sending ships to the bottom, and sinking them together with the men in them. And although I will impart others, there is no danger in them; because the mouth of the tube, by which you breathe, is above the water supported on bags of corks.[4]
”
￼
￼
Various hydraulic machines.
Bridges and hydraulics[edit]
Leonardo's study of the motion of water led him to design machinery that utilized its force. Much of his work on hydraulics was for Ludovico il Moro. Leonardo wrote to Ludovico describing his skills and what he could build:
“
... very light and strong bridges that can easily be carried, with which to pursue, and sometimes flee from, the enemy; and others safe and indestructible by fire or assault, easy and convenient to transport and place into position.
”
Among his projects in Florence was one to divert the course of the Arno, in order to flood Pisa. Fortunately, this was too costly to be carried out. He also surveyed Venice and came up with a plan to create a movable dyke for the city's protection against invaders.
In 1502, Leonardo produced a drawing of a single span 240 m (720 ft) bridge as part of a civil engineering project for Ottoman Sultan Beyazid II of Istanbul. The bridge was intended to span an inlet at the mouth of the Bosphorus known as the Golden Horn. Beyazid did not pursue the project, because he believed that such a construction was impossible. Leonardo's vision was resurrected in 2001 when a smaller bridge based on his design was constructed in Norway. On 17 May 2006, the Turkish government decided to construct Leonardo's bridge to span the Golden Horn.[17]
War machines[edit]
￼
￼
An Arsenal.
Leonardo's letter to Ludovico il Moro assured him:
“
When a place is besieged I know how to cut off water from the trenches and construct an infinite variety of bridges, mantlets and scaling ladders, and other instruments pertaining to sieges. I also have types of mortars that are very convenient and easy to transport.... when a place cannot be reduced by the method of bombardment either because of its height or its location, I have methods for destroying any fortress or other stronghold, even if it be founded upon rock. ....If the engagement be at sea, I have many engines of a kind most efficient for offence and defence, and ships that can resist cannons and powder.
”
In Leonardo's notebooks there is an array of war machines which includes a tank to be propelled by two men powering crank shafts. Although the drawing itself looks quite finished, the mechanics were apparently not fully developed because, if built as drawn, the tank, with a lot of effort, might be made to rotate on the spot, but would never progress in a forward direction. In a BBC documentary, a military team built the machine and changed one of the gears in order to make the machine work. It has been suggested that Leonardo deliberately left this error in the design, in order to prevent it from being put to practice by unauthorized people.[18] Another machine, propelled by horses with a pillion rider, carries in front of it four scythes mounted on a revolving gear, turned by a shaft driven by the wheels of a cart behind the horses.
￼
￼
Leonardo's 'Tank'.
Leonardo's notebooks also show cannons which he claimed "to hurl small stones like a storm with the smoke of these causing great terror to the enemy, and great loss and confusion." He also designed an enormous crossbow. Following his detailed drawing, one was constructed by the British Army, but could not be made to fire successfully. In 1481 Leonardo designed a breech-loading, water cooled cannon with three racks of barrels allowed the re-loading of one rack while another was being fired and thus maintaining continuous fire power. The 'fan type' gun with its array of horizontal barrels allowed for a wide scattering of shot.
Leonardo was the first to sketch the wheel-lock musket c. 1500 AD (the precedent of the flintlock musket which first appeared in Europe by 1547), although as early as the 14th century the Chinese had used a flintlock 'steel wheel' in order to detonate land mines.[19]
While Leonardo was working in Venice, he drew a sketch for an early diving suit, to be used in the destruction of enemy ships entering Venetian waters. A suit was constructed for a BBC documentary using pigskin treated with fish oil to repel water. The head was covered by a helmet with two eye glasses at the front. A breathing tube of bamboo with pigskin joints was attached to the back of the helmet and connected to a float of cork and wood. When the scuba divers tested the suit, they found it to be a workable precursor to a modern diving suit, the cork float acting as a compressed air chamber when submerged.[20]
Flight[edit]
￼
￼
The flight of a bird.
In Leonardo's infancy a hawk had once hovered over his cradle. Recalling this incident, Leonardo saw it as prophetic.
“
An object offers as much resistance to the air as the air does to the object. You may see that the beating of its wings against the air supports a heavy eagle in the highest and rarest atmosphere, close to the sphere of elemental fire. Again you may see the air in motion over the sea, fill the swelling sails and drive heavily laden ships. From these instances, and the reasons given, a man with wings large enough and duly connected might learn to overcome the resistance of the air, and by conquering it, succeed in subjugating it and rising above it.[4]
”
￼
￼
Design for a flying machine with wings based closely upon the structure of a bat's wings.
The desire to fly is expressed in the many studies and drawings. His later journals contain a detailed study of the flight of birds and several different designs for wings based in structure upon those of bats which he described as being less heavy because of the impenetrable nature of the membrane. There is a legend that Leonardo tested the flying machine with one of his apprentices, and that the apprentice fell and broke his leg.[21] Experts Martin Kemp and Liana Bortolon agree that there is no evidence of such a test, which is not mentioned in his journals.
One design that he produced shows a helicopter to be lifted by a rotor powered by four men. It would not have worked since the body of the craft itself would have rotated in the opposite direction to the rotor.[22]
While he designed a number of man powered flying machines with mechanical wings that flapped, he also designed a parachute and a light hang glider which could have flown.[23]

Musical Instrument[edit]
Main article: viola organista
The viola organista was an experimental musical instrument invented by Leonardo da Vinci. It was the first bowed keyboard instrument (of which any record has survived) ever to be devised.
Leonardo's original idea, as preserved in his notebooks of 1488–1489 and in the drawings in the Codex Atlanticus, was to use one or more wheels, continuously rotating, each of which pulled a looping bow, rather like a fanbelt in an automobile engine, and perpendicular to the instrument's strings.
Leonardo's inventions made reality[edit]
￼
￼
Model of a flying machine by Leonardo in the V&amp;A museum.
In the late 20th century, interest in Leonardo's inventions escalated. There have been many projects which have sought to turn diagrams on paper into working models. One of the factors is the awareness that, although in the 15th and 16th centuries Leonardo had available a limited range of materials, modern technological advancements have made available a number of robust materials of light-weight which might turn Leonardo's designs into reality. This is particularly the case with his designs for flying machines.
A difficulty encountered in the creation of models is that often Leonardo had not entirely thought through the mechanics of a machine before he drew it, or else he used a sort of graphic shorthand, simply not bothering to draw a gear or a lever at a point where one is essential in order to make a machine function. This lack of refinement of mechanical details can cause considerable confusion. Thus many models that are created, such as some of those on display at Clos Luce, Leonardo's home in France, do not work, but would work, with a little mechanical tweaking.

            <Notes>



He needed a vantage point. If he wanted to kill this thing, his aim needed to be precise. With a sickening lurch, he realised what his best option was.
He was sure there must be some sort of nautical term for it—he’d overheard the crewmen bandying words like starboard and aft about—but he hadn’t any idea what the appropriate word might be, but the balloon was attached to the ship both by ropes and by huge towers of wood and brass. Some of these towers had footholds build in, and railings along the sides, so they could be climbed in order to perform maintenance duties upon the ship. It was unlikely that they were meant to be used while the ship was flying, in reverse, at top speed.
He swore. He could still hear through the din of battle, the sound of bullets striking metal, and more unsettling than that, the noise of metal bending and warping beneath the pressure of hundreds of bullets fired in succession.
He made his way to the ladder, if that’s what it was called, grabbed the railing, and began to climb. The tower wasn’t shielded by armor either, but there was no time to even think about that just now. Or to think about his fear of heights. He hoisted himself up onto the canvas blimp, and lay flat upon it. There were no railings up here, no handholds, and little to shield him from the wind.
The sail along the balloon’s spine had been lowered, and the shields had been raised. A grid of metal framed the canvas blimp, and sheets of armor plating were affixed in segments, attached to the metal frame in order to cover the gaps between each metal section of the frame. Each gap was about two meters square, but there were spaces that were not entirely covered. The shields were mounted on mechanical arms along the frame, intended to mitigate the risk provided by the gaps in the armor. The ship’s design was built on redundancies. Where the armor failed, the shields would still provide cover.
Jonathan crawled his way toward one of the raised shields, grabbing the arm to which it was mounted, and used it to pull himself to his feet. He looked down at Kas, and raised his blunderbuss, grabbing it from his holster.
In answer, Kas began his assault, launching what seemed to be a limitless supply of cannon fodder. The Dreadful shuddered with every deafening blast of the cannon, but the beast was undeterred.
Jonathan, perched precariously atop the balloon. He held tight to the thick shield, training his eyes on the creature.
Cannonball after cannonball, Kas was relentless. Finally, Kas managed to penetrate the creature’s chitinous shell, and the beast let out that terrible, unearthly wail. Jonathan was ready.
He fired.
It only took a moment. The grenade sailed into the creature’s open jaws. He holstered the blunderbuss and unfurled his umbrella. The concussive blast of the grenade was accompanied by the sickening crunch of splintering carapace; a blast of fire erupted from the creature’s maw, taking with it a significant section of the cockroach’s head, which rained down in enormous, wet chunks.
Jonathan let out a cry of indignation when his parasol was struck by a particularly large segment of gruesome flesh. He lost his balance, slid toward the edge of the balloon, grasping for something, anything. His hands banged and slid against the metal plating that covered the balloon, cutting gashes into his left.
The umbrella slipped out of his hand and blew away with frightening speed, and a moment later he lost the blunderbuss. But he finally managed to grasp something. Her legs dangled off the edge of the balloon in a way that was most unladylike.
When he finally caught his breath, he saw that it was Jonathan's hand that he had caught.
“I’ve got you,” he said, hoisting his back up onto the relative safety of the balloon.
“Jonathan,” he said, out of breath but otherwise managing to sound entirely unshaken by the incident. “Sorry about that.”
“That’s twice now.”
He frowned. Twice that he’d saved his life. Well, he could keep on saving his life every day for a month and he’d still owe his for losing consciousness.
“It won’t happen again,” he said grumpily. “What ever are you doing up here?”
He shrugged. “I could ask you the same question,” he said. “I’ve got a plan,” he added, taking a swig from a flask he kept hidden in his vest pocket.
His face was flushed, his balance questionable at best. But it was hardly his intoxication that caught his attention. As Jonathan looked at him and the balloons on which they stood, he began to suspect what he had been up to all this time. Whatever his plan was, it would be astoundingly dangerous. Not that he was one to complain about that. So long as his plan worked.
He had removed a large sheet of the thick armor that surrounded the blimp. If the dirigible were to be struck by stray bullet now, they’d go up in flames. But they were all doomed anyhow, if they didn’t do something. Jonathan had also unlashed some of the ropes that bound the hydrogen gasbags inside the canvas envelope. He had secured another section of rope around the middlemost balloon, and had wound a great deal of that same rope around his own body as well.
“Whatever are you planning?” Jonathan breathed, though he was sure she’d already worked it out in his head.
“Jonathan,” he said, slurring his words, “If you would just kindly ask the beast to fly above us, just here.” He pointed at where he wanted the creature. “I’m afraid I’ve been rather inspired by your notion of filling its mouth with incendiary devices.”
He winked.
“No,” he said. “If this gets you killed,” he started, pointing a finger at him. “I won’t have this on my head. What exactly are you planning?”
“First, I’m going to dislodge this ballonet,” he said, grinning drunkenly. “Then, I’ll just fly up into the creature’s mouth, cause the ballonet to explode, then drop back down to the ship. Easy peasy.”
Jonathan shook his head. Aside from his notion that it would be easy, the plan wasn’t entirely ridiculous. But even if it did work, simply dropping back down to the ship would be nearly impossible.
“Lemon squeezey,” he added.
“What happens if you miss the ship?” he asked.
“Don’t worry about that,” said Jonathan. “I have exactly two contingency plans. This will work,” he assured his.
Angry though he was, Jonathan turned back to face the demonic cockroach. Kip had been fending it off nicely while hhe’d been otherwise occupied. Captain Merrick was still standing at the wheel, courageous in the face of danger.
“Captain!” he shouted, but his voice was drowned out by the wail of the wounded insect and the buffeting of the open air.
He started to descend the ladder.  He practically jumped down the ladder onto the deck below.


“Jonathan, if you’re still intent on this idiocy, you’d best get ready,” Jonathan shouted up at him.
A moment later, they’d managed to get under the cockroach: easier than asking it to fly above them.
For a moment, Jonathan thought they’d been struck by something. The entire ship jolted like a boat about to capsize. Captain Merrick clutched the wheel and did his best to steady the vessel. From somewhere within the ship they could hear the unusual sound of intense friction.
Then, another jolt, and the ship began to lose altitude. The captain cursed, shouted for the engineers to check on the barometer or the difference engine or whatever else it was that would keep them aloft. They weren’t about to crash, but they were descending far too quickly and suddenly for the captain’s liking. A moment later, he discovered the cause of their descent.
Above them, one of the ship’s own balloons had come free and was spiralling up toward the monster.
“What on earth…” he began. Then the light of the dreadful’s lantern fell upon the rogue ballonet, and he saw.
It was Jonathan. He had attached himself to the balloon and was attempting to steer the balloon with the weight of his body, aiming straight for the gaping hole in the creature’s mouth.
Shaking off his amazement, Palmer fired a few shots as cover fire.
Jonathan's heart caught in his chest. He grabbed one of the lanterns that hung from the ship, and aimed it at Jonathan, keeping him bathed in light.
“Idiot,” he cursed him.
The balloon found its mark. In one simultaneous motion, Jonathan hurled a grenade into the creature’s jaws and cut himself loose. Down, down toward The Penny Dreadful he fell.
He would have made it too, landing straight on the deck of the airship. Suddenly, the explosion of the hydrogen balloon lit the night sky, throwing Jonathan's horribly off course.
Blood and severed body parts rained down from the monstrous cockroach. The crew watched as Jonathan plummeted toward the ground.
Jonathan's heart sank.
“By God!” Lockwood exclaimed from within the crew cabin, loud enough to be heard outside.
They shared his sentiment, but there was nothing to be done. Not a word was spoken. Not a breath was breathed.</Notes>

            <Synopsis>Annabel and Abraham gain access to the underground lair of the Resurrectionists via a sewer maintenance tunnel</Synopsis>
            <Text>As Abraham Palmer had explained, only a limited number of offices provided access to the Resurrectionist hideout within the Grimmer Company. Charles Grimmer’s former office had the secret elevator, as did Mr. Palmer’ own office. Mrs. Grimmer’s office was the third with such access. The fourth and final access point from within the printing company was not an elevator but a hidden staircase, which led from the library to the Beta Laboratory, which was shared by a number of the Resurrectionist’s scientists.
“So, what are we doing in the sewer?” Annabel asked. He had a scarf wrapped around her face to deal with the smell, although the tunnel they were using was a maintenance tunnel. No actual sewage flowed along this route, but it was close enough to the pipes that did contain sewage, so the smell was still something to contend with.
“When Joseph Bazalgette designed his sewage system, Mr. Grimmer—Charles Grimmer, that is—arranged to have this tunnel constructed in secret, connecting the sewer system to The Hunting Society’s underground headquarters.”
“Mr. Grimmer was a very suspicious man,” Annabel mused.
Abraham grunted in agreement.
“Yes, well, you’re not paranoid if they really are trying to kill you, right?”
They had entered via the Abbey Mills Pumping Station, gaining access to the building via an open window on the second story. With a rope, lowered from the deck of the Penny Dreadful, they’d swung across, onto the roof of the lower annex. From there, it had been simple enough to climb in through the window.
Annabel had donned masculine attire for the adventure, at least from the waist down. She wore a pair of white trousers in combination with a striped black and white blouse and a rich brown bodice, accessorized with a light brown corduroy jacket with a mandarin collar. Her key hung from her neck, pendant-like. She wore a bulky pair of leather boots, given that they’d had to trudge through the shallow waters of the pumping station when passing through to the labyrinth of maintenance tunnels. Somehow she still managed to look stylish despite the androgynous ensemble. She carried only the one firearm, which Mr. Palmer had been kind enough to part with earlier. It was tucked into a holster at her hip, but it had only six bullets in its chamber. She wished there’d been more time to prepare.
Abraham carried a gas lantern as they walked the length of the tunnel, which cast shadows along the walls of the corridor. He favoured his left hand, given the injury to his right shoulder.
Professor Ashcroft had managed to extract the bullet and stitch his wound; though the professor’s education was specific to the study of Aeronautical Engineering, he was still the most qualified among them, and had a steady enough hand. Abraham had given up his shotgun to Mr. Lockwood, given that their stock of weapons was limited and that he could not fire the weapon himself without worsening his injury.
Their footsteps echoed down the tunnel.
“So, the Resurrectionists don’t know about this entrance?” Annabel asked.
She’d been told that Abraham would smuggle her into the Resurrectionists’ hideout, but the full details had been revealed to her as they went. Time was a concern. They needed to get in and out of the Resurrectionist lair before it was too late to stop the Dead London project.
Meanwhile, the rest of the Vigilance Committee were seeing to their own missions, each individual plan being integral to the larger plan.
Eventually, the narrow tunnel came to a dead end. They halted, Annabel looking up at Abraham with concern.
“Did we take a wrong turn somewhere?” she asked.
He shook his head, grinning knowingly.
“Nope,” he said, reaching up with gloved hand and exploring the brickwork with his fingers until he found a hidden latch.
“Ah,” said Annabel. “I believe I understand. It would hardly do to have some unsuspecting sewage worker wander down this dead tunnel and inadvertently discover the secret facility.”
“Exactly, m’dear,” said Abraham, gruffly.
As the latch pulled, the bricks began to swing open, like a door. As they did, it became clear that they were not bricks at all. Just foam, painted to look like bricks, like the bricks in a stage production. Faux brickwork, glued to a thick, metal door, which opened into a closet. As they stepped inside it, Annabel noted that there was trickery on both sides to conceal the door. False brickwork slid open to hide the door from view.</Text>

Dirigible airships compared with related aerostats, from a turn of the 20th century encyclopedia
An airship or dirigible is a type of aerostat or lighter-than-air aircraft that can be steered and propelled through the air using rudders and propellers or other thrust mechanisms. Unlike aerodynamic aircraft such as fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, which produce lift by moving a wing through the air, aerostatic aircraft stay aloft by having a large "envelope" filled with a gas which is less dense than the surrounding atmosphere. The first lifting gas used was hydrogen, although this had well-known concerns over its flammability. Helium was rare in most parts of the world, but large amounts were discovered in the USA. This meant that this non-flammable gas was rarely used for airships outside of the USA.[1] All modern airships, since the 1960s, use helium.[note 1]
The main types of airship are non-rigid (or blimps), semi-rigid and rigid. Blimps are pressure airships where internal pressure, maintained by forcing air into an internal ballonet, is used to maintain both the shape of the airship and its structural integrity. Semi-rigid airships maintain the envelope shape by internal pressure, but have some form of internal support such as a fixed keel to which control and engine gondolas, stabilizers, and steering surfaces are mounted. Rigid airships have a structural framework which maintains the shape and carries all loads such as gondolas and engines. The framework contains numerous balloons, known as "gas cells" or "gasbags" which supply static lift without having to bear any structural loading.[2] Rigid airships are often called Zeppelins, as the type was invented by Count Zeppelin and the vast majority of rigid airships built were manufactured by the firm he founded.
Airships were the first aircraft to enable controlled, powered flight, and were widely used before the 1940s, but their use decreased over time as their capabilities were surpassed by those of aeroplanes. Their decline continued with a series of high-profile accidents, including the 1937 burning of the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg, and the destruction of the USS Akron. In the 21st century airships have been used in advertising, tourism, camera platforms for sporting events, geological surveys, and aerial observation - applications where the ability to hover in one place for an extended period outweighs the need for speed and maneuverability.

Terminology[edit]
Aerostat[edit]
There is some confusion around the term aerostat with regard to airships. This confusion arises because aerostat has two different meanings. One meaning of aerostat refers to all craft that remain aloft using buoyancy (static not dynamic lift): in this sense airships are a type of aerostat. The narrower and more technical meaning of aerostat refers only to tethered or moored balloons: in this sense airships are not aerostats.
Dirigible[edit]
In some countries, airships are also known as dirigibles from the French (diriger to direct plus -ible), meaning "directable" or steerable. The first airships were called dirigible balloons. Over time, the word balloon was dropped from the phrase. In modern usage, balloon refers to any buoyant aircraft that generally relies on wind currents for horizontal movement, and usually has a mechanism to control vertical movement. Santos-Dumont designed, built, and flew the first practical dirigible, demonstrating that routine, controlled flight was possible. This "conquest of the air", in particular his winning the Deutsch de la Meurthe prize on 19 October 1901 on a flight that rounded the Eiffel Tower,[2] made him one of the most famous people in the world during the early 20th century.(Hamre, Bonnie. "Alberto Santos Dumont." About.com. Retrieved: 20 August 2012).
Gondola[edit]
￼
￼
A blimp's gondola
The term "gondola" is used to describe a crew car of an airship, slung beneath the centre of the envelope. These may be short, for cockpit and landing gear alone, or longer to provide passenger space. Early gondolas were open structures slung beneath the envelope, later ones were enclosed and hung directly from the internal framing. A non-rigid blimp carries all of its passengers within a gondola. Rigid airships may have further passenger or cargo space internal to the envelope. The large airship the Graf Zeppelin was noted for its distinctively short passenger gondola, mounted far forward so as to improve ground clearance. The majority of crew accommodation and cargo holds were placed inside the envelope.
Small airships and blimps carry their engine(s) in their gondola. Where there were multiple engines on larger airships, these were placed in separate gondolas, termed power cars or engine cars.[3] To allow asymmetric thrust to be applied for maneuvering, these power cars were mounted towards the sides of the envelope, away from the centre line gondola. This also raised them above the ground, reducing the risk of a propeller strike when landing. Widely spaced power cars were also termed wing cars, from the use of "wing" to mean being on the side of something, as in a theater, rather than the aerodynamic device.[3] These engine cars carried a crew during flight who maintained the engines as needed, but who also worked the engine controls, throttle etc., mounted directly on the engine. Instructions were relayed to them from the pilot's station by a telegraph system, as on a ship.[3]
Envelope[edit]
In a non-rigid airship the envelope is the outer surface of the aircraft, containing the ballonets within it. In a rigid airship it is the outer fabric covering, stretched over the structural framework.
Zeppelin[edit]
The term zeppelin is a genericized trademark that originally referred to airships manufactured by the German Zeppelin Company, which pioneered dirigible design in the early years of the twentieth century. The word Luftschiff, German for "airship", usually prefixed their crafts' names.
In modern common usage, the terms Zeppelin, dirigible and airship are used interchangeably for any type of rigid airship, with the term blimp alone used to describe non-rigid airships. Although the blimp also qualifies as a "dirigible", the term is seldom used with blimps. In modern technical usage, airship is the term used for all aircraft of this type, with Zeppelin referring only to aircraft of that manufacture, and blimp referring only to non-rigid airships.[clarification needed]

	•	Non-rigid airships (blimps) use a pressure level in excess of the surrounding air pressure to retain their shape during flight. Unlike the rigid design, the non-rigid airship's gas envelope has no compartments. At sea level, the ballonets (internal flexible cells) are filled with air. As altitude is increased, the lifting gas expands and air from the ballonets is expelled through air valves to maintain the same hull shape. To return to sea level, the process is reversed. Air is forced back into the ballonets by both scooping air from the engine exhaust and using auxiliary blowers.
	•	Semi-rigid airships, like blimps, require internal pressure to maintain their shape, but have extended, usually articulated keel frames running along the bottom of the envelope to distribute suspension loads into the envelope and allow lower envelope pressures.
	•	Rigid airships (Zeppelin is almost synonymous with this type) have rigid frames containing multiple, non-pressurized gas cells or balloons to provide lift. Rigid airships do not depend on internal pressure to maintain their shape and can be made to virtually any size.
	•	Metal-clad airships were of two kinds: rigid and non-rigid. Each kind used a thin gas-tight metal envelope, rather than the usual rubber-coated fabric envelope. Only four metal-clad ships are known to have been built, and only two actually flew: Schwarz's first aluminum rigid airship of 1893 collapsed,[4] while his second flew;[5] the non-rigid ZMC-2 flew 1929 to 1941;[6] while the 1929 non-rigid Slate City of Glendale collapsed on its first flight attempt.[7][8][9]
	•	Thermal airships use a heated lifting gas, usually air, in a fashion similar to hot air balloons.

The navigable balloon developed by Henri Dupuy de Lôme in 1872.
The Jesuit Father Francesco Lana de Terzi is sometimes referred to as the "Father of Aeronautics."[10] In 1670, he published a description of an "Aerial Ship" supported by four copper spheres from which the air was evacuated. Although impractical (since external air pressure would cause the spheres to collapse unless their thickness was such as to make them too heavy to be buoyant) the basic principle was sound.[11]
A more practical dirigible airship was described by Lieutenant Jean Baptiste Marie Meusnier in a paper entitled "Mémoire sur l’équilibre des machines aérostatiques" (Memorandum on the equilibrium of aerostatic machines) presented to the French Academy on 3 December 1783. The 16 water-color drawings published the following year depict a 260-foot-long (79 m) streamlined envelope with internal ballonnets that could be used for regulating lift: this was attached to a long carriage that could be used as a boat if the vehicle was forced to land in water. The airship was designed to be driven by three propellers and steered with a sail-like aft rudder. In 1784, Jean-Pierre Blanchard fitted a hand-powered propeller to a balloon, the first recorded means of propulsion carried aloft. In 1785 he crossed the English Channel in a balloon equipped with flapping wings for propulsion and a bird-like tail for steering.[12]
The 19th century saw continued attempts to add method of propulsion to balloons. The first aviation pioneer of Australia was Dr William Bland. In March 1851, Bland sent designs for his "Atmotic Airship" to the Great Exhibition in London where a model was displayed. This was an elongated balloon with a steam engine driving twin propellers suspended underneath. The lift of the balloon was estimated at 5 tons and the car with the fuel to weigh 3.5 tons, giving a payload of 1.5 tons.[13][14] Bland believed that the machine could be driven at 80 km/h (50 mph) and could fly from Sydney to London in less than a week.
The first person to make an engine-powered flight was Henri Giffard who, in 1852, flew 27 km (17 mi) in a steam-powered airship.[15] Airships would develop considerably over the next two decades. In 1872, the French naval architect Dupuy de Lome launched a large limited navigable balloon, which was driven by a large propeller and the power of eight people.[16] It was developed during the Franco-Prussian war, as an improvement to the balloons used for communications between Paris and the countryside during the siege of Paris, but was completed only after the end of the war.
Paul Haenlein flew an airship with an internal combustion engine running on the coal gas used to inflate the envelope over Vienna, the first use of such an engine to power an aircraft in 1872.[17][18] Charles F. Ritchel made a public demonstration flight in 1878 of his hand-powered one-man rigid airship, and went on to build and sell five of his aircraft.[18]
In 1883, the first electric-powered flight was made by Gaston Tissandier, who fitted a 1.5 hp (1.1 kW) Siemens electric motor to an airship. The first fully controllable free-flight was made in a French Army airship, La France, by Charles Renard and Arthur Constantin Krebs in 1884. The 170 ft (52 m) long, 66,000 cu ft (1,900 m3) airship covered 8 km (5.0 mi) in 23 minutes with the aid of an 8.5 hp (6.3 kW) electric motor,[19] and a 435 kilograms (960 lb) battery. In 1884 and 1885, it made seven flights.[18]
In 1888, the Campbell Air Ship, designed by Professor Peter C. Campbell, was made by the Novelty Air Ship Company. This was lost at sea in 1889 while being flown by Professor Hogan during an exhibition flight.[20]
In 1888–97, Dr. Frederich Wölfert built three airships powered by Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft-built petrol engines, the last of which caught fire in flight and killed both occupants in 1897.[21] The 1888 version used a 2 hp one cylinder Daimler engine and flew 10 km (6 mi) from Canstatt to Kornwestheim.[22][23]

Santos-Dumont#6 rounding the Eiffel Tower, winning the Deutsch Prize in 1901.
In 1897, a rigid airship created by the Hungarian engineer David Schwarz and further modified after his death, made its first flight at Tempelhof field in Berlin. After Schwarz's death, his wife, Melanie Schwarz, was paid 15,000 marks by Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin for information about the airship.[24][clarification needed]
Alberto Santos-Dumont was a wealthy Brazilian who lived in France and had a passion for flying. He designed 18 balloons and dirigibles before turning his attention to fixed-winged aircraft.[25] In 1901, in his airship Number 6, a small blimp, he won the Deutsch de la Meurthe prize of 100,000 francs for flying from the Parc Saint Cloud to the Eiffel Tower and back in under thirty minutes.[26] Many inventors were inspired by Santos-Dumont's small airships and a veritable airship craze began worldwide. Many airship pioneers, such as the American Thomas Scott Baldwin, financed their activities through passenger flights and public demonstration flights. Stanley Spencer built the first British airship with funds from advertising baby food on the sides of the envelope.[27] Others, such as Walter Wellman and Melvin Vaniman, set their sights on loftier goals, attempting two polar flights in 1907 and 1909, and two trans-Atlantic flights in 1910 and 1912.[28]
In 1902, the Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres Quevedo published in Spain and France his innovative project of airship. With a semirigid body, it overcame the flaws of these type of aircraft both on rigid structure (Zeppelin type) and flexible, providing the airships with more stability during flight, the capability of using heavier engines and a greater passenger load. In 1905, helped by captain A. Kindelán, he built the ship "España" in the Guadalajara military facilities. Next year he registered it (pat. number 38692) not awakening official interest. In 1909 he registered an improved design (pat. number 44956) which he offered to the French company Astra, who started mass-producing it in 1911. The design was widely used during the Great War by the allies.
"The Golden Age"[edit]
￼
￼
LZ1, Count Zeppelin's first airship
The "Golden Age of Airships" began in July 1900 with the launch of the Luftschiff Zeppelin LZ1. This led to the most successful airships of all time: the Zeppelins. These were named after Count von Zeppelin who began working on rigid airship designs in the 1890s, leading to the badly flawed LZ1 in 1900 and the more successful LZ2 in 1906. At the beginning of World War I the Zeppelin airships had a framework composed of triangular lattice girders, covered with fabric and containing separate gas cells. Multi-plane, later cruciform, tail surfaces were used for control and stability, and two engine/crew cars hung beneath the hull driving propellers attached to the sides of the frame by means of long drive shafts. Additionally, there was a passenger compartment (later a bomb bay) located halfway between the two cars.
Other airship builders were also active before the war: the French company Lebaudy Frères specialized in semi-rigid airships from 1902 (e.g. the Patrie and the République), designed by their engineer Henri Julliot, who later worked for the American company Goodrich; the German firm Schütte-Lanz built the SL series from 1911; another German firm Luft-Fahrzeug-Gesellschaft built the Parseval-Luftschiff (PL) series from 1909,[29] and Italian Enrico Forlanini's firm had built and flown the first two Forlanini airships.[30]
In 1910 Walter Wellman unsuccessfully attempted the first aerial crossing of the Atlantic Ocean in the airship America.
World War I[edit]

German airship Schütte Lanz SL2 bombing Warsaw in 1914.
The prospect of airships as bombers had been recognized in Europe well before the airships were up to the task. H. G. Wells' The War in the Air (1908) described the obliteration of entire fleets and cities by airship attack. The Italians forces became the first to use dirigibles for a military purpose during the Italo–Turkish War, the first bombing mission being flown on 10 March 1912.[31] It was World War I, however, that marked the airship's real debut as a weapon. The Germans, French and Italians all used airships for scouting and tactical bombing roles early in the war, and all learned that the airship was too vulnerable for operations over the front. The decision to end operations in direct support of armies was made by all in 1917.[32][33]
Count Zeppelin and others in the German military believed they had found the ideal weapon with which to counteract British naval superiority and strike at Britain itself. More realistic airship advocates believed the Zeppelin was a valuable long range scout/attack craft for naval operations. Raids on England began in January 1915, reached a first peak in 1915, and then were discontinued in August 1918.[34] Zeppelins proved to be terrifying but inaccurate weapons. Navigation, target selection and bomb-aiming proved to be difficult under the best of conditions. The darkness, high altitudes and clouds that were frequently encountered by Zeppelin missions reduced accuracy even further. The physical damage done by the Zeppelins over the course of the war was trivial, and the deaths that they caused (though visible) amounted to a few hundred at most. The Zeppelins were initially immune to attack by aircraft and antiaircraft guns: as the pressure in their envelopes was only just higher than ambient air, holes had little effect. But once incendiary bullets were developed and used against them, their flammable hydrogen lifting gas made them vulnerable at lower altitudes. Several were shot down in flames by British defenders, and others crashed en route. They then started flying higher and higher above the range of other aircraft, but this made their bombing accuracy even worse and success harder to achieve.
Advocates of the naval scouting role of the airship proved to be correct, and the land bombing campaign proved to be disastrous in terms of morale, men and material[citation needed]. Many pioneers of the German airship service died in what was the first strategic bombing campaign in history.
Countermeasures by the British included sound detection equipment, searchlights and anti-aircraft artillery, followed by night fighters in 1915. One method used early in the war when short range meant the airships had to fly from forward bases, and when the only Zeppelin production facilities were in Friedrichshafen, was bombing of airship sheds by the British Royal Naval Air Service. Late in the war, the development of the aircraft carrier led to the first successful carrier-based air strike in history. The morning of 19 July 1918, seven Sopwith 2F.1 Camels were launched from HMS Furious and struck the airship base at Tondern, destroying the Zeppelins L 54 and L 60.[35]

Before the World War, the British Army was interested in blimps for scouting purposes.[36] The Royal Navy, recognizing the potential threat that scouting Zeppelins might pose, decided in 1908 to produce an example of rigid airship so that the threat might be evaluated in practice instead of theory.[37] The Royal Navy was to continue development of rigid airships until the end of the war. The British Army abandoned airship development in favour of aeroplanes by the start of the war, but the Royal Navy had recognized the need for small airships to counteract the submarine and mine threat in coastal waters.[38] Beginning in February 1915, they began to deploy the SS (Sea Scout) class of blimp. These had a small envelope of 1,699-1,982 m³ (60–70,000 ft³) and at first used standard single engined planes (BE2c, Maurice Farman, Armstrong FK) shorn of wing and tail surfaces as control cars, as an economy measure. Eventually more advanced blimps with purpose built cars, such as the C (Coastal), C* (Coastal Star), NS (North Sea), SSP (Sea Scout Pusher), SSZ (Sea Scout Zero), SSE (Sea Scout Experimental) and SST (Sea Scout Twin) classes were developed. The NS class, after initial teething problems, proved to be the largest and finest non-rigid airships in British service. They had a gas capacity of 360,000 cu ft (10,000 m3), a crew of 10 and an endurance of 24 hours. Six 230 lb (100 kg) bombs were carried, as well as three to five machine guns.
British blimps were used for scouting, mine clearance, and submarine attack duties. During the war, the British operated 226 airships, mostly non-rigid, most of which were of indigenous construction, though some non-rigid airships operated were purchased from France and even Germany (before the war).[39] Of that number several were sold to Russia, France, the US and Italy. Britain, in turn, purchased one M-type semi-rigid from Italy whose delivery was delayed until 1918. Eight large rigid airships had been completed by the armistice, (No. 9r, four 23 Class, two R23X Class and one R31 Class), although several more were in an advanced state of completion by the war's end.[40] The large number of trained crews, low attrition rate and constant experimentation in handling techniques meant that at the war's end Britain was the world leader in non-rigid airship technology.
Both France and Italy continued to use airships throughout the war. France preferred non-rigid types while Italy operated 49 semi-rigid airships in both the scouting and bombing roles.[41]
Aeroplanes had essentially replaced airships as bombers by the end of the war, and Germany's remaining zeppelins were destroyed by their crews, scrapped or handed over to the Allied powers as spoils of war. The British rigid airship program, which had mainly been a reaction to the potential threat of the German airhips, was wound down.
Inter-war period[edit]
A number of nations operated airships between the two world wars. Many operated blimps. Britain, the United States and Germany were the main operators of rigid airships with Italy and France using them to a lesser extent. Italy, the Soviet Union, United States and Japan mainly concentrated on semi-rigid airships. On May 12, 1926, The Italian Norge, a semi-rigid airship, was the first aircraft confirmed to fly over the North Pole.

Rescuers scramble across the wreckage of British R-38/USN ZR-2, 24 August 1921
The British R33 and R34 were near-identical copies of the German L 33, which crashed virtually intact in Yorkshire on 24 September 1916.[42] Despite being almost three years out of date by the time they were launched in 1919, they were two of the most successful in British service. The creation of the Royal Air Force (RAF) in early 1918 created a hybrid British airship program. The RAF was not interested in airships and the Admiralty was, so a deal was made where the Admiralty would design any future military airships while the RAF would handle manpower, facilities and operations.[43] After the armistice, the airship program was rapidly wound down, and rigid airship operations were curtailed. On 2 July 1919, R34 began the first double crossing of the Atlantic by an aircraft. It landed at Mineola, Long Island on 6 July after 108 hours in the air. The return crossing began on 8 July because of concerns about mooring the ship in the open, and took 75 hours. Impressed, British leaders began to contemplate a fleet of airships to link Britain to its far-flung colonies, although post-war economic conditions led to the scrapping of most airships and dispersion of trained personnel. British airship development resumed with the Imperial Airship Scheme of 1924, which produced the R-100 and R-101, both flown in 1929. The major consequence of Britain's interest in establishing airship service to the empire was the effort to use the Allies' seizure of German airships and airship sheds to avoid competition from Germany.[44] The US Navy contracted to buy the British built R-38, but before that airship was turned over to the US, it was lost to structural failure due to both inadequate structural design and operation.[45]

Construction of USS Shenandoah (ZR-1), 1923
The first American-built rigid airship was USS Shenandoah, built and christened on 20 August in Hangar No. 1[46] at Lakehurst, New Jersey. It flew in 1923, while the Los Angeles was under construction. It was the first ship to be inflated with the noble gas helium, which was still so rare that the Shenandoah contained most of the world's reserves. When the Los Angeles was delivered, the two airships had to share the limited supply of Helium, and thus alternated operating and overhauls.[47]

US Navy Zeppelin USS Macon (ZRS-5) over Moffett Field in 1933
The United States Navy purchased what became the USS Los Angeles and paid with "war reparations" money, owed according to the Versailles Treaty, thus saving The Zeppelin works. The success of the Los Angeles encouraged the US Navy to invest in its own, larger airships. The Los Angeles flew successfully for 8 years.
Meanwhile Germany was building the Graf Zeppelin (LZ 127), the largest airship that could be built in the company's existing shed, and intended to stimulate interest in passenger airships. The Graf Zeppelin burned blau gas, similar to propane, stored in large gas bags below the hydrogen cells, as fuel. Since its density was similar to that of air, it avoided the weight change when fuel was used, and thus the need to valve hydrogen. The Graf was a great success and compiled an impressive safety record, flying over 1,600,000 km (990,000 mi) (including the first circumnavigation of the globe by air) without a single passenger injury.[48]

The US Navy developed the idea of using airships as airborne aircraft carriers, although the British had experimented with a plane trapeze on their R33 many years before.[clarification needed] The USS Los Angeles was used to experiment with the project, followed by two other airships, the world's largest at the time, to test the principle—the USS Akron and Macon. Each carried four F9C Sparrowhawk fighters in its hangar, and could carry a fifth on the trapeze. The idea had mixed results. By the time the Navy started to develop a sound doctrine for using the ZRS-type airships, the last of the two built, USS Macon, was lost. The seaplane had become more mature, and was considered a better investment.[49]
Eventually the US Navy lost all three American-built rigid airships to accidents. USS Shenandoah on a poorly planned publicity flight flew into a severe thunderstorm over Noble County, Ohio on 3 September 1925. It broke into pieces, killing 14 of its crew. USS Akron was caught in a severe storm and flown into the surface of the sea off the shore of New Jersey on 3 April 1933. It carried no life boats and few life vests, so 73 of its crew of 76 died from drowning or hypothermia. USS Macon was lost after suffering a structural failure off the shore of Point Sur Lightstation State Historic Park on 12 February 1935. The failure caused a loss of gas, which was made much worse when the aircraft was driven over pressure height causing it to lose too much helium to maintain flight.[50] Only 2 of its crew of 83 died in the crash thanks to the inclusion of life jackets and inflatable rafts after the Akron disaster.
Britain's Burney Scheme and decline in airships[edit]
During the 1920s, Sir Dennistoun Burney suggested a plan for an air service throughout the British Empire using airships (the Burney Scheme).[43] Following the election of Ramsay MacDonald in 1924, the Burney scheme was transformed into a government-controlled program, the Imperial Airship Scheme, which contracted for two airships, one to be developed by the a private company, the Airship Guarantee Company, and the other under Air Ministry control by the Royal Airship Works. The two designs were radically different. The "capitalist" ship, the R100, was more conventional, while the "socialist" ship, the R101, had many innovative design features. Construction of both took longer than expected, and the airships did not fly until 1929. Neither airship was capable of the service intended, though the R100 did complete a proving flight to Canada and back in 1930.[51] However, on 5 October 1930 the R101, which had not been thoroughly tested after major modifications, crashed on its maiden voyage of life at Beauvais in France killing 48 of the 54 people aboard. Among the dead were the craft's chief designer and the Secretary of State for Air. Because of the bad publicity surrounding the crash, the Air Ministry grounded the competing R100 in 1930 and sold it for scrap in 1931, ending the era of British rigid airships.[52]
The Empire State Building was completed in 1931 with a dirigible mast, in anticipation of passenger airship service. Various entrepreneurs experimented with commuting and shipping freight via airship.[53]

By the mid-1930s only Germany still pursued airship development. The Zeppelin company continued to operate the Graf Zeppelin on passenger service between Frankfurt and Recife in Brazil, taking 68 hours. Even with the small Graf Zeppelin, the operation was almost profitable.[54] In the mid-1930s work started to build an airship designed specifically to operate a passenger service across the Atlantic.[55] The Hindenburg (LZ 129) completed a very successful 1936 season carrying passengers between Lakehurst, New Jersey and Germany. 1937 started with the most spectacular and widely remembered airship accident. Approaching the mooring mast minutes before landing on 6 May 1937, the Hindenburg burst into flames and crashed. Of the 97 people aboard, 36 died: 13 passengers, 22 aircrew, and one American ground-crewman. The disaster happened before a large crowd, was filmed and a radio news reporter was recording the arrival. This was a disaster which theater goers could see and hear the next day. The Hindenburg disaster shattered public confidence in airships, and brought a definitive end to the "golden age". The day after Hindenburg crashed, the Graf Zeppelin landed at the end of its flight from Brazil, ending intercontinental passenger airship travel.
Hindenburg's sister ship, the Graf Zeppelin II (LZ 130), could not perform commercial passenger flights without helium, which the United States refused to sell. The Graf Zeppelin flew some test flights and conducted electronic espionage until 1939 when it was grounded due to the start of the war. The last two Zeppelins were scrapped in 1940.
Development of airships continued only in the United States, and to a smaller extent, the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union had several semi-rigid and non-rigid airships. The semi-rigid SSSR-V6 OSOAVIAKhIM was among the largest of these craft, and set the longest endurance flight at the time of over 130 hours. However, it crashed into a mountain in 1938, killing 13 of the 19 people on board. While this was a severe blow towards the Soviet airship program, they continued to operate non-rigid airships until 1950.
World War II[edit]
While Germany determined that airships were obsolete for military purposes in the coming war and concentrated on the development of aeroplanes, the United States pursued a program of military airship construction even though it had not developed a clear military doctrine for airship use. At the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 that brought the United States into World War II, it had 10 non-rigid airships:
	•	4 K-class: K-2, K-3, K-4 and K-5 designed as patrol ships built from 1938.
	•	3 L-class: L-1, L-2 and L-3 as small training ships, produced from 1938.
	•	1 G-class built in 1936 for training.
	•	2 TC-class that were older patrol ships designed for land forces, built in 1933. The US Navy acquired them from the United States Army in 1938.

Only K- and TC-class airships were suitable for combat and they were quickly pressed into service against Japanese and German submarines which were then sinking US shipping within visual range of the US coast. US Navy command, remembering the airship anti-submarine success from World War I, immediately requested new modern anti-submarine airships and on 2 January 1942 formed the ZP-12 patrol unit based in Lakehurst from the four K airships. The ZP-32 patrol unit was formed from two TC and two L airships a month later, based at NAS Moffett Field in Sunnyvale, California. An airship training base was created there as well. The status of submarine-hunting Goodyear airships in the early days of World War II has created significant confusion. Although various accounts refer to airships Resolute and Volunteer as operating as "privateers" under a Letter of Marque, Congress never authorized a commission, nor did the President sign one.[56]

K-class blimps of USN Blimp Squadron ZP-14 conducted antisubmarine warfare operations at the Strait of Gibraltar in 1944-45.
In the years 1942–44, approximately 1,400 airship pilots and 3,000 support crew members were trained in the military airship crew training program and the airship military personnel grew from 430 to 12,400. The US airships were produced by the Goodyear factory in Akron, Ohio. From 1942 till 1945, 154 airships were built for the US Navy (133 K-class, 10 L-class, seven G-class, four M-class) and five L-class for civilian customers (serial numbers L-4 to L-8).
The primary airship tasks were patrol and convoy escort near the US coastline. They also served as an organization centre for the convoys to direct ship movements, and were used in naval search and rescue operations. Rarer duties of the airships included aerophoto reconnaissance, naval mine-laying and mine-sweeping, parachute unit transport and deployment, cargo and personnel transportation. They were deemed quite successful in their duties with the highest combat readiness factor in the entire US air force (87%).
In 1944-45, the United States Navy moved an entire squadron of eight Goodyear K class blimps (K-123, K-130, K-109, K-134, K-101, K-112, K-89, &amp; K-114) with flight and maintenance crews from Weeksville Naval Air Station in North Carolina to Naval Air Station Port Lyautey, French Morocco. Their mission was to locate and destroy German U-boats in the relatively shallow waters around the Strait of Gibraltar where magnetic anomaly detection (MAD) was viable. PBY aircraft had been searching these waters but MAD required low altitude flying that was dangerous at night for these aircraft. The blimps were considered a perfect solution to establish a 24/7 MAD barrier (fence) at the Straits of Gibraltar with the PBYs flying the day shift and the blimps flying the night shift. The first two blimps (K-123 &amp; K-130) left South Weymouth NAS on 28 May 1944 and flew to Argentia, Newfoundland, the Azores, and finally to Port Lyautey where they completed the first transatlantic crossing by non-rigid airships on 1 June 1944. The blimps of USN Blimp Squadron ZP-14 (Blimpron 14, aka The Africa Squadron) also conducted mine-spotting and mine-sweeping operations in key Mediterranean ports and various escorts including the convoy carrying United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to the Yalta Conference in 1945.[57]
During the war some 532 ships without airship escort were sunk near the US coast by enemy submarines. Only one ship, the tanker Persephone, of the 89,000 or so in convoys escorted by blimps was sunk by the enemy.[58] Airships engaged submarines with depth charges and, less frequently, with other on-board weapons. They were excellent at driving submarines down, where their limited speed and range prevented them from attacking convoys. The weapons available to airships were so limited that until the advent of the homing torpedo they had little chance of sinking a submarine.[59]
Only one airship was ever destroyed by U-boat: on the night of 18/19 July 1943, a K-class airship (K-74) from ZP-21 division was patrolling the coastline near Florida. Using radar, the airship located a surfaced German submarine. The K-74 made her attack run but the U-boat opened fire first. K-74's depth charges did not release as she crossed the U-boat and the K-74 received serious damage, losing gas pressure and an engine but landing in the water without loss of life. The crew was rescued by patrol boats in the morning, but one crewman, Aviation Machinist's Mate Second Class Isadore Stessel, died from a shark attack. The U-Boat, submarine U-134, was slightly damaged and the next day or so was attacked by aircraft, sustaining damage that forced it to return to base. It was finally sunk on 24 August 1943 by a British Vickers Wellington near Vigo, Spain[60][61]
Fleet Airship Wing One operated from Lakehurst, NJ, Glynco, GA, Weeksville, NC, South Weymouth NAS Massachusetts, Brunswick NAS and Bar Harbor ME, Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, and Argentia, Newfoundland.
Some US airships saw action in the European war theater. The ZP-14 unit operating in the Mediterranean area from June 1944 completely denied the use of the Gibraltar Straits to Axis submarines. Airships from the ZP-12 unit took part in the sinking of the last U-Boat before German capitulation, sinking U-881 on 6 May 1945 together with destroyers Atherton and Mobery.
Other airships patrolled the Caribbean, Fleet Airship Wing Two, Headquartered at NAS Richmond, Florida, covered the Gulf of Mexico from Richmond and Key West, FL, Houma, Louisiana, as well as Hitchcock and Brownsville, Texas. FAW 2 also patrolled the northern Caribbean from San Julian,[clarification needed] the Isle of Pines (now called Isla de la Juventud) and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba as well as Vernam Field, Jamaica.
Navy blimps of Fleet Airship Wing Five, (ZP-51) operated from bases in Trinidad, British Guiana and Paramaribo, Suriname. Fleet Airship Wing Four operated along the coast of Brazil. Two squadrons, VP-41 and VP-42 flew from bases at Amapá, Igarape Assu, Sao Luiz, Fortaleza, Fernando de Noronha, Recife, Maceió, Ipitanga (near Salvador, Bahia), Caravellas, Vitoria and the hangar built for the Graf Zeppelin at Santa Cruz, Rio de Janeiro.
Fleet Airship Wing Three operated squadrons, ZP-32 from Moffett Field, ZP-31 at NAS Santa Ana, and ZP-33 at NAS Tillamook, Oregon. Auxiliary fields were at Del Mar, Lompoc, Watsonville and Eureka, CA, North Bend and Astoria, Oregon, as well as Shelton and Quillayute in Washington.
From 2 January 1942 till the end of war airship operations in the Atlantic, the airships of the Atlantic fleet made 37,554 flights and flew 378,237 hours. Of the over 70,000 ships in convoys protected by blimps, only one was sunk by a submarine while under blimp escort.[59]
The Soviet Union used a single airship during the war. The W-12, built in 1939, entered service in 1942 for paratrooper training and equipment transport. It made 1432 runs with 300 metric tons of cargo until 1945. On 1 February 1945, the Soviets constructed a second airship, a Pobeda-class (Victory-class) unit (used for mine-sweeping and wreckage clearing in the Black Sea) which crashed on 21 January 1947. Another W-class - W-12bis Patriot - was commissioned in 1947 and was mostly used for crew training, parades and propaganda.
Modern use[edit]
Although airships are no longer used for passenger transport, they are still used for other purposes such as advertising, sightseeing, surveillance and research.

In the 1980s, Per Lindstrand and his team introduced the GA-42 airship, the first airship to use fly-by-wire flight control which considerably reduced the pilot's workload.
The world's largest thermal airship (300,000 cubic feet/8,495 m³) was constructed by the Per Lindstrand company for French botanists in 1993. The AS-300 carried an under-slung raft, which was positioned by the airship on top of tree canopies in the rain forest, allowing the botanists to carry out their treetop research without significant damage to the rainforest. When research was finished at a given location, the airship returned to pick up and relocate the raft.[62]
In the spring of 2004, Lindstrand Technologies supplied the world's first fully functional unmanned airship to the Ministry of Defense in Spain. This airship carried a 42 kilograms (93 lb) classified payload and its surveillance mission was also classified. Four years later, this airship, which is designated GA-22, still flies on an almost daily basis.
In June 1987, the US Navy awarded a US$168.9 million contract to Westinghouse Electric and Airship Industries of the UK to demonstrate whether a blimp could be used as an airborne platform to detect the threat of sea-skimming missiles, such as the Exocet.[63] At 2.5 million cubic feet, the Westinghouse/Airship Industries Sentinel 5000 (Redesignated YEZ-2A by the U. S. Navy) prototype design was to have been the largest blimp ever constructed.[64] However, additional funding for the Naval Airship Program was killed in 1995 and development was discontinued.
The CA-80 airship, which was launched in 2000 by Shanghai Vantage Airship Manufacture Co., Ltd., had a successful trial flight in September 2001. This model of airship was designed for the purpose of advertisement and propagation, air-photo, scientific test, tour and surveillance duties. It was certified as a grade-A Hi-Tech introduction program (№ 20000186) in Shanghai, China. The CAAC authority granted a type design approval and certificate of airworthiness for the model CA-80 airship, which has been published in the Jane's All the World's Aircraft for five times (2003–08).[65]
In the 1990s, the Zeppelin company reentered the airship business. Their new model, designated the Zeppelin NT, made its maiden flight on 18 September 1997. As of 2009, there were four NT aircraft flying, a fifth completed in March 2009 and an expanded NT-14 (14,000 cubic meters of helium, capable of carrying 19 passengers) under construction. One was sold to a Japanese company, and was planned to be flown to Japan in the summer of 2004. Due to delays getting permission from the Russian government, the company decided to transport the airship to Japan by ship. One of the four NT craft is in South Africa carrying diamond detection equipment from De Beers, an application at which the very stable low vibration NT platform excels. The project included design adaptations for high heat operation and desert climate, as well as a separate mooring mast and a very heavy mooring truck. NT-4 belongs to Airship Ventures of Moffett Field, Mountain View in the San Francisco Bay Area, and provides sight-seeing tours
Blimps are used for advertising and as TV camera platforms at major sporting events. The most iconic of these are the Goodyear blimps. Goodyear operates three blimps in the United States, and The Lightship Group operates up to 19 advertising blimps around the world. Airship Management Services owns and operates three Skyship 600 blimps. Two operate as advertising and security ships in North America and the Caribbean. Airship Ventures operates a Zeppelin NT for advertising, passenger service and special mission projects. They are the only airship operator in the U.S. authorized to fly commercial passengers.
Skycruise Switzerland AG owns and operates two Skyship 600 blimps. One operates regularly over Switzerland used on sightseeing tours. The Switzerland-based Skyship 600 has also played other roles over the years. For example, it was flown over Athens during the 2004 Summer Olympics as a security measure. In November 2006, it carried advertising calling it The Spirit of Dubai as it began a publicity tour from London to Dubai, UAE on behalf of The Palm Islands, the world's largest man-made islands created as a residential complex.
Los Angeles-based Worldwide Aeros Corp. produces FAA Type Certified Aeros 40D Sky Dragon airships.[66]
In May 2006, the US Navy began to fly airships again after a hiatus of nearly 44 years. The program uses a single American Blimp Company A-170 non-rigid airship, with designation MZ-3A. Operations focus on crew training and research, and the platform integrator is Northrop Grumman. The program is directed by the Naval Air Systems Command and is being carried out at NAES Lakehurst, the original centre of U.S. Navy lighter-than-air operations in previous decades.
In November 2006, the U.S. Army bought an A380+ airship from American Blimp Corporation through a Systems level contract with Northrop Grumman and Booz Allen Hamilton. The airship started flight tests in late 2007, with a primary goal of carrying 2,500 lb (1,100 kg) of payload to an altitude of 15,000 ft (4,600 m) under remote control and autonomous waypoint navigation. The program will also demonstrate carrying 1,000 lb (450 kg) of payload to 20,000 ft (6,100 m) The platform could be used for Multi-Intelligence collections. In 2008, the CA-150 airship was launched by Vantage Airship. This is an improved modification of model CA-120 and completed manufacturing in 2008. With larger volume and increased passenger capacity, it is the largest manned non-rigid airship in China at present.[67]
In 2010, the US Army awarded a $517 million (£350.6 million) contract to Northrop Grumman and partner Hybrid Air Vehicles, to develop a Long Endurance Multi-Intelligence Vehicle (LEMV) system, in the form of three HAV 304's.[68][69][70] The project was cancelled in February 2012, due to it being behind schedule and over budget; also the forthcoming US withdrawal from Afghanistan where it was intended to be deployed.[71]
An airship was prominently featured in the James Bond film A View to a Kill, released in 1985. The Skyship 500 had the livery of Zorin Industries.[72]
A-NSE, a French company, manufactures and operates airships and aerostats. For 2 years, A-NSE has been testing its airships for the French Army. Airships and aerostats are operated to provide intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) support. Many innovations are developed by A-NSE : water ballast take-off and landing system, variable geometry envelope, thrust–vectoring system etc.…

The largest airship at 245 meters length and 41 meters diameter dwarfs the size of the largest aeroplanes.
In the 1930s, Zeppelins successfully competed with other means of transport. They could carry significantly more passengers than other contemporary aircraft while providing amenities similar to those on ocean liners, such as private cabins, observation decks, and dining rooms. Less importantly, the technology was potentially more energy-efficient than heavier-than-air designs. Zeppelins were also faster than ocean liners. On the other hand, operating airships was quite involved. Often the crew would outnumber passengers, and on the ground large teams were necessary to assist mooring and very large hangars were required at airports.
Today, with large, fast, and more cost-efficient fixed-wing aircraft, it is unknown whether huge airships can operate profitably in regular passenger transport though, as energy costs rise, attention is once again returning to these lighter than air vessels as a possible alternative. At the very least, the idea of comparatively slow, "majestic" cruising at relatively low altitudes and in comfortable atmosphere certainly has retained some appeal. There have been some niches for airships in and after World War II, such as long-duration observations, antisubmarine patrol, platforms for TV camera crews, and advertising; these, however, generally require only small and flexible craft, and have thus generally been better fitted for cheaper blimps.
Heavy lifting[edit]
It has periodically been suggested that airships could be employed for cargo transport, especially delivering extremely heavy loads to areas with poor infrastructure over great distances. This has also been called roadless trucking.[74] Also, airships could be used for heavy lifting over short distances (e.g. on construction sites); this is described as heavy-lift, short-haul.[75] In both cases, the airships are heavy haulers. One recent enterprise of this sort was the Cargolifter project, in which a hybrid (thus not entirely Zeppelin-type) airship even larger than Hindenburg was projected. Around 2000, CargoLifter AG built the world's largest cantilever shop hall measuring 360 m (1,180 ft) long, 210 m (690 ft) wide and 107 m (351 ft) high about 60 km (37 mi) south of Berlin. In May 2002, the project was stopped for financial reasons; the company had to file bankruptcy. Although no rigid airships are currently used for heavy lifting, hybrid airships are being developed for such purposes. John McPhee's The Deltoid Pumpkin Seed is the story of one company attempting this.
Passenger transport[edit]

￼
A Zeppelin NT airship
In the 1990s, the successor of the original Zeppelin company in Friedrichshafen, the Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik GmbH, reengaged in airship construction. The first experimental craft (later christened Friedrichshafen) of the type ″Zeppelin NT″ flew in September 1997. Though larger than common blimps, the Neue Technologie (New Technology) Zeppelins are much smaller than their giant ancestors and not actually Zeppelin-types in the classical sense; they are sophisticated semi-rigids. Apart from the greater payload, their main advantages compared to blimps are higher speed and excellent maneuverability. Meanwhile, several Zeppelin NT have been produced and operated profitably in joyrides, research flights and similar applications.
In June 2004, a Zeppelin NT was sold for the first time to a Japanese company, Nippon Airship Corporation, for tourism and advertising mainly around Tokyo. It was also given a role at the 2005 Expo in Aichi. The aircraft began a flight from Friedrichshafen to Japan, stopping at Geneva, Paris, Rotterdam, Munich, Berlin, Stockholm and other European cities to carry passengers on short legs of the flight. However, Russian authorities denied overflight permission so the airship had to be dismantled and shipped to Japan rather than following the historic Graf Zeppelin flight from Germany to Japan.
In 2008, Airship Ventures Inc. began operations from Moffett Federal Airfield near Mountain View, California and until November 2012 offered tours of the San Francisco Bay Area for up to 12 passengers.
Use in exploration[edit]
In November 2005, De Beers, the diamond mining company, launched an airship exploration program over the remote Kalahari desert. A Zeppelin, loaded with high-tech equipment, is used to find potential diamond mines by scanning the local geography for low-density rock formations - so-called kimberlite pipes. On 21 September 2007, the airship was severely damaged by a whirlwind while in Botswana. One crew member, who was on watch aboard the moored craft, was slightly injured but released after overnight observation in hospital.
Thermal airships and remotes[edit]
￼
￼
Thermal airship (manufacturer GEFA-FLUG/Germany)
Several companies, such as Cameron Balloons in Bristol, United Kingdom, build hot-air airships. These combine the structures of both hot-air balloons and small airships. The envelope is the normal cigar shape, complete with tail fins, but is inflated with hot air instead of helium to provide the lifting force. A small gondola, carrying the pilot and passengers, a small engine, and the burners to provide the hot air are suspended below the envelope, beneath an opening through which the burners protrude.
Hot-air airships typically cost less to buy and maintain than modern helium-based blimps, and can be quickly deflated after flights. This makes them easy to carry in trailers or trucks and inexpensive to store. They are usually very slow moving, with a typical top speed of 25–30 km/h (15–20 mph, 6.7–8.9 m/s). They are mainly used for advertising, but at least one has been used in rainforests for wildlife observation, as they can be easily transported to remote areas.
Remote-controlled (RC) airships, a type of unmanned aerial system (UAS), are sometimes used for commercial purposes such as advertising and aerial video and photography as well as recreational purposes. They are particularly common as an advertising mechanism at indoor stadiums. While RC airships are sometimes flown outdoors, doing so for commercial purposes is illegal in the US. In particular, Docket FAA-2006-25714 states that: "The FAA recognizes that people and companies other than modelers might be flying UAS with the mistaken understanding that they are legally operating under the authority of AC 91-57. AC 91-57 only applies to modelers, and thus specifically excludes its use by persons or companies for business purposes."[76] The same docket item identifies 14CFR121 as the appropriate certification basis for experimental unmanned aircraft, which would included unmanned airships operating for commercial purposes, so commercial use of an unmanned airship is not prohibited - instead it must be certified under part 121 not 91.
A total of 4,700 airships and blimps exist across the world.
Present-day research[edit]

Prototypes and experimental models[edit]
Hybrid designs such as the Heli-Stat airship/helicopter, the Aereon aerostatic/aerodynamic craft, and the CycloCrane (a hybrid aerostatic/rotorcraft), have struggled to take flight. The Cyclocrane was also interesting in that the airship's envelope rotated along its longitudinal axis.
In 2005, a short-lived project of the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) was WALRUS HULA which explored the potential for using airships as long-distance, heavy lift craft.[77][78] The primary goal of the research program was to determine the feasibility of building an airship capable of carrying 500 short tons (450 t) of payload a distance of 12,000 mi (19,000 km) and land on an unimproved location without the use of external ballast or ground equipment (such as masts). In 2005, two contractors, Lockheed Martin and US Aeros Airships were each awarded approximately $3 million to do feasibility studies of designs for WALRUS. In late March 2006, DARPA announced the termination of work on WALRUS after completion of the current Phase I contracts.[citation needed]
The US government is funding two major projects in the high altitude arena. The Composite Hull High Altitude Powered Platform (CHHAPP) is sponsored by US Army Space and Missile Defense Command. This aircraft is also sometimes called HiSentinel High-Altitude Airship. This prototype ship made a five-hour test flight in September 2005. The second project, the high-altitude airship (HAA), is sponsored by DARPA. In 2005, DARPA awarded a contract for nearly $150 million to Lockheed Martin for prototype development. First flight of the HAA was planned for 2008 but suffered programmatic and funding delays. The HAA project evolved into the High Altitude Long Endurance-Demonstrator (HALE-D). The U.S. Army and Lockheed Martin launched the first-of-its kind HALE-D on July 27, 2011.[79] After a short flight, the experimental craft was brought down, intentionally or accidentally, in rural Pennsylvania.[80][81]
On 31 January 2006 Lockheed Martin made the first flight of their secretly built hybrid airship designated the P-791. The design is very similar to the SkyCat, unsuccessfully promoted for many years by the now financially troubled British company Advanced Technologies Group (ATG). Although Lockheed Martin is developing a design for the DARPA WALRUS HULA project, it claimed that the P-791 is unrelated to WALRUS. Nonetheless, the design represents an approach that may well be applicable to WALRUS. Some believe that Lockheed Martin had used the secret P-791 program as a way to get a head start on the other WALRUS competitor, US Aeros Airships.[citation needed]
Hybrid airship[edit]
A hybrid airship is a general term for an aircraft that combines characteristics of heavier-than-air (aeroplane or helicopter) and lighter-than-air technology. Examples include helicopter/airship hybrids intended for heavy lift applications and dynamic lift airships intended for long-range cruising. It should be noted that most airships, when fully loaded with cargo and fuel, are usually ballasted to be heavier than air, and thus must use their propulsion system and shape to create aerodynamic lift, necessary to stay aloft. All airships can be operated to be slightly heavier than air at periods during flight (descent). However, the term "hybrid airship" refers to craft that obtain a significant portion of their lift from aerodynamic lift or other kinetic means.
For example, the Aeroscraft is a buoyancy assisted air vehicle that generates lift through a combination of aerodynamics, thrust vectoring and gas buoyancy generation and management, and for much of the time will fly heavier than air. Aeroscraft is Worldwide Aeros Corporation's continuation of DARPA's now cancelled Walrus HULA (Hybrid Ultra Large Aircraft) project.[82]
Practical comparison with heavier-than-air aircraft[edit]
The advantage of airships over aeroplanes is that static lift sufficient for flight is generated by the lifting gas and requires no engine power. This was an immense advantage before the middle of World War I and remained an advantage for long distance, or long duration operations until World War II. Modern concepts for high altitude airships include photovoltaic cells to reduce the need to land to refuel, thus they can remain in the air until consumables expire.
The disadvantages are that an airship has a very large reference area and comparatively large drag coefficient, thus a larger drag force compared to that of aeroplanes and even helicopters. Given the large frontal area and wetted surface of an airship, a practical limit is reached around 80–100 miles per hour (130–160 km/h). Thus airships are used where speed is not critical.
The gross lift capability of an airship is equal to the buoyant force minus the weight of the airship. This assumes standard air temperature and pressure conditions. Corrections are usually made for water vapor and impurity of lifting gas, as well as percentage of inflation of the gas cells at liftoff.[83] Based on specific lift (pounds of lift per thousand cubic feet of lifting gas), the greatest static lift is provided by hydrogen (71 lbs. lift/1000 cubic feet of gas) with helium (66 lbs. lift/1000 cubic feet of gas) a close second.[84] At 39 lbs./1000 cubic feet, steam is a distant third. Other gases, such as methane, carbon monoxide, ammonia and natural gas[citation needed] have even less lifting capacity and are flammable, toxic, corrosive, or all three. Operational considerations such as whether the lift gas can be economically vented and produced in flight for control of buoyancy (as with hydrogen) or even produced as a byproduct of propulsion (as with steam) affect the practical choice of lift gas in airship designs.
Considering the Hindenburg disaster, one may question why such a flammable gas as hydrogen was used in the first place, when it is only marginally better than helium as a lifting gas. The answer is that hydrogen can be produced easily and economically through the electrolysis of water or by chemical reactions, whereas helium is scarce and expensive, occurring only in trace amounts in a few natural gas deposits.
In addition to static lift, an airship can obtain a certain amount of dynamic lift from its engines. Dynamic lift in past airships has been about 10% of the static lift. Dynamic lift allows an airship to "take off heavy" from a runway similar to fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft. However, this requires additional weight in engines, fuel and landing gear, negating some of the static lift capacity.
The altitude at which an airship can fly largely depends on how much lifting gas it can lose due to expansion before stasis is reached. The ultimate altitude record for a rigid airship was set in 1917 by the L-55 under the command of Hans-Kurt Flemming when he forced the airship to 24,000 ft (7,300 m) attempting to cross France after the "Silent Raid" on London. The L-55 lost lift as the descent to lower altitudes over Germany compressed the gas left in the cells, and thus the weight of air displaced. L-55 crashed due to loss of lift.[85] While such waste of gas was necessary for the survival of airships in the later years of WW I, it was impractical for commercial operations, or operations of helium-filled military airships. The highest flight made by a hydrogen filled passenger airship was 5,500 ft (1,700 m) on the Graf Zeppelin's around the world flight.[86] The practical limit for rigid airships was about 3,000 feet (900 m), and for pressure airships around 8,000 ft (2,400 m).[citation needed]
Modern airships use dynamic helium volume. At sea level altitude, helium only takes up a small part of the hull, while the rest is filled with air. As the airship ascends, the helium inflates with reduced outer pressure, and air is pushed out and released from the downward valve. This allows an airship to reach any altitude with balanced inner and outer pressure if the buoyancy is enough. Some civil aerostats could reach 100,000 ft (30,000 m) without explosion due to overloaded inner pressure.[citation needed]
The greatest disadvantage of the airship is size, which is essential to increasing performance. As size increases, the problems of ground handling increase geometrically.[87] As the German Navy transitioned from the "p" class Zeppelins of 1915 with a volume of over 1,100,000 cu ft (31,000 m3) to the larger "q" class of 1916, the "r" class of 1917, and finally the "w" class of 1918, at almost 2,200,000 cu ft (62,000 m3) ground handling problems reduced the number of days the Zeppelins were able to make patrol flights. This availability declined from 34% in 1915, to 24.3% in 1916 and finally 17.5% in 1918.[88]
So long as the power-to-weight ratios of aircraft engines remained low and specific fuel consumption high, the airship had an edge for long range or duration operations. As those figures changed, the balance shifted rapidly in the aeroplane's favour. By mid-1917, the airship could no longer survive in a combat situation where the threat was aeroplanes. By the late 1930s, the airship barely had an advantage over the aeroplane on intercontinental over-water flights, and that advantage had vanished by the end of WW II.
This is in face-to-face tactical situations. Currently, a High Altitude Airship project is planned to survey hundreds of kilometres as their operation radius, often much farther than the normal engagement range of a military aeroplane.[clarification needed] This provides better early warning, even farther than the Aegis system.[clarification needed] The current Aegis system is often based on a sea vessel like Ticonderoga Class and Burke Class, which have restricted radio horizon and line of sight.[clarification needed] For example, a radar mounted on a vessel platform 30 m (100 ft) high has radio horizon at 20 km (12 mi) range, while a radar at 18,000 m (59,000 ft) altitude has radio horizon at 480 km (300 mi) range. This is significantly important for detecting low-flying cruise missiles or fighter-bombers.
Today, airships are used primarily for command, control and as a communication platform; to establish and maintain reliable and secure connectivity among all forces, provide transparent data across the echelons; precisely locate friendly and enemy forces; detect targets on an extended battlefield at a minimal exposure to enemy forces; real time targeting; navigation assistance; battle management; monitor radio conversations, etc.

The most commonly used lift gas, helium, is inert so acts as a fire extinguisher.[89] Modern airships have a natural buoyancy and special design that offers a virtually zero catastrophic failure mode.[90] While on long-haul flights weather patterns would be flown to avoid bad weather, the hull's mass largely damps the effect of turbulence, just as a large tanker rides through rough seas.[citation needed] An airship is usually a poor lightning target,[citation needed] as it is constructed mainly from composite materials. If it is struck, built-in protection devices minimize the risk to the vehicle and its cargo.[citation needed]
A series of structural vulnerability tests were done by the UK Defence Evaluation and Research Agency DERA on a Skyship 600, an earlier airship built by the Munk team to a similar pressure-stabilized design. Several hundred high-velocity bullets were fired through the hull, and even two hours later the vehicle would have been able to return to base. The airship is virtually impervious to automatic rifle and mortar fire: ordnance passes through the envelope without causing critical helium loss. In all instances of light armament fire evaluated under both test and live conditions, the vehicle was able to complete its mission and return to base. The internal hull pressure is maintained at only 1–2% above surrounding air pressure, the vehicle is highly tolerant to physical damage or to attack by small-arms fire or missiles.[91]

            <Synopsis>Roderick Steen finds the secret staircase into the underground Resurrectionist facility.</Synopsis>
            <Text>While Mrs. Thompson left to speak with the kitchen staff about preparing the tea, Roderick was left alone in the company library. This was not Roderick’s first visit to the printing company’s library, but he’d never noticed a staircase in here before. Of course, that was the whole point of a secret staircase. It wouldn’t be in plain sight, he reasoned.
The library was one of the largest rooms in the company, and one of the most decadent in its decor. It had high ceilings to accomodate the tall bookshelves, and ladders on wheels were used to access the books on the top shelves.
The room was decorated with the busts of some of the company’s most famous authors. The library was divided into several sections, with the newspaper archives on a slightly lower level and the literary magazines and society papers up a few staircases on the east side of the library. The main section was dedicated to the penny dreadfuls and gothic novels.
It could take Roderick days to find the hidden staircase. Palmer had explained that the hidden elevator in his office was accessed by activating a hidden lever, attached to a false book, but he didn’t know how to open the staircase—only that it existed. Roderick was reasonably confident that it would be accessed by activating another hidden lever, probably one attached to a false book. The question was—which book? Mr. Grimmer had enjoyed his secrets, and so even Palmer hadn’t been privvy to that information. Thus, it was up to Roderick to figure it out, and he needed to do so in a matter of minutes. Before Mrs. Thompson returned with the tea.
He scanned the shelves and tried not to be disheartened. There were thousands of books. Thousands of possibilities. Roderick needed to narrow it down to just one.
He folded his cane under the pit of his arm, and strode purposefully over to one of the bookshelves. Palmer’s secret elevator was accessed via Tales of Dead London, a compilation of penny dreadful tales of zombies. Naturally, it had some significance to Palmer and Grimmer, who had built the underground facility in order to improve their odds in the fight against zombies. Whichever tome was used to activate the hidden elevator, it was likely to be one that held some significance to Charles Grimmer. Something to do with zombies, Roderick supposed. It was unlikely, however, that Mr. Grimmer would have reused Tales of Dead London.
He scanned the titles on the shelves, hoping that one of them might jump out at him. The Flying Dutchman. Ela The Outcast. The String of Pearls. Varney The Vampire. The Children of the Night. It was easy enough to eliminate the titles that didn’t fit. The trick was finding the one that did. Roderick was still running his fingers over the spines of the dusty novels, when the door swung inward, announcing Mrs. Thompson’s return.
“Find anything, Mr. Steen?” she asked innocently.
He managed to hide his disappointment at her return, offering her a smile, as she directed the servant to lay out a spread of tea on the table.
“Extra honey for Mr. Steen,” she said, giving him a conspiratorial wink. “He likes it sweet.”
Roderick flushed at her flirtation, but he considered that perhaps he could use her to his advantage. She’d already proved helpful in getting him into the library.
“Perhaps you could help me to remember a title I was thinking of,” he said.
“Of course. I’ve been with the Grimmer Company a long time. I’m familiar with most of the titles. Though,” she added, making a sweeping gesture at the numerous books, “Certainly not all of them.”
“The one I’m looking for would be about ghouls,” he said. “Creatures that had returned from the dead, and which consumed human flesh.”
“Ah. That’s an easy one,” she said with a smile. “You’re thinking of Tales of Dead London. One of our most popular titles.”
“Is there anything else that meets that description?” he asked. “Something other than Tales of Dead London? Something, perhaps, that held some significance to Mr. Grimmer?”
Roderick saw a flicker of recognition in Mrs. Thompson’s expression. She nodded thoughtfully and adjusted her spectacles. At last, she said. “I’m not sure this is what you’re thinking of…”
“Try me.”
“Well, following the success of Dead London, Mr. Grimmer commissioned another series to be written in a similar style. He turned down hundreds of submissions, however, dismissing them all as cheap imitations. Eventually, he ended up writing the series himself. It was a commercial failure, however, so the series ended prematurely, but Mr. Grimmer was always quite fond of it.”
“That’s it!” Roderick said. “It must be! Mrs. Thompson, you brilliant woman!”
Her cheeks dimpled, and she flushed, scarlet.
“Do you remember what was it called? Where might I find it?”
“Now, let’s see,” she said, and began to walk up and down the shelves, looking for the title in question. Eventually, she paused. “Yes, here it is.”
The Hunting Society, Roderick read, by Charles Grimmer.
There were tiny screws sticking into its spine, hidden to the unobservant but plain as day to Roderick, who was specifically looking for anything out of the ordinary.
“It’s about a secret society that hunts ghouls,” said Mrs. Thompson, who seemed delighted to have found it. “Quite gruesome. Do you read penny dreadfuls, Mr. Steen?”
“Not generally,” Roderick replied. “But I do make the odd exception.”
He grabbed the book, thinking its interior might contain some further clue, but rather than sliding easily off the shelf, the book pulled out at an angle and clicked into place at a forty-five degree angle and would budge no further.
The book must have activated a switch, hidden behind the shelf. A hidden panel in one of the walls began to slide forward, and the cacophonous sound of an enormous machine began to swell like the crescendo of an excessively percussive orchestra. When it was finished, Roderick could see the spiral staircase, hidden in the alcove behind the panel.
Mrs. Thompson shrieked with alarm.
Roderick let go of the book, and the panel began to slide back into place.
“Mrs. Thompson, would you be so kind as to hold on to this?” he asked.
Her face was frozen in shock. “Mr. Steen, what’s going on?”
“Just hold this,” he said.
She had every right to probe further, to demand to know what was going on, but she nodded and grabbed hold of the book.
“Thank you,” he said.
He headed towards the staircase. Once through the gap that had been hidden by the sliding panel, he stepped onto the staircase and began to descend. He paused. While Roderick flattered himself that he was a handsome enough gentlemen and that he had a certain charm that tended to affect women, somehow he thought there was more to Mrs. Thompson than that.
“Mrs. Thompson, why are you helping me?” he asked.
She flashed him a matronly smile. “I’ve been with the Grimmer Company a long time, ever since Mr. Grimmer was just a boy. I know you’re a friend of his. My loyalty is to Mr. Grimmer. I trust that yours is too, Mr. Steen.”
Roderick nodded. Mrs. Thompson must have observed enough suspicious activity to know that something was going on beneath the Grimmer company, even if she didn’t know exactly what it was.
 “You can let go now, Mrs. Thompson.”
“Be careful, Mr. Steen.”
The panel slid closed, shutting Roderick in to the dark stairwell. With one hand on the railing, he began to climb down. He could hear the harsh, ululating sound of a hand-cranked siren resonating throughout the compound. Whatever chance they’d had at stealth, it was gone. The Resurrectionists already knew they were here.</Text>

            <Title>Scene 28</Title>
            <Text>“Take the next left,” Annabel told the driver.
They were driving at a breakneck pace, the horses barely controlled as the driver urged them down the narrow street. On both sides of the road, the dead tore into human flesh, eating noisily and single-mindedly. As the hackney approached, some of the dead looked up from their meals, mouths dripping blood. Then they either returned to their meals or joined their brethren in the chase. An army of zombies staggered after horse and carriage.
Annabel spotted a pair of eyes looking at her from a shop window—the eyes of a living person—but they couldn’t afford to stop and help.
The dead weren’t quick enough to catch them, but Annabel feared the cab would lose control and topple over. Then it would all be over. Annabel would sooner put a bullet in her own head than be a meal for zombies. She hoped that it wouldn’t come to that, but the horses were panicked. They were surrounded on all sides by predators, which drove them to greater and greater speeds. They would never make the turn at this speed.
“Whoa!” the driver called, pulling desperately at the reins.
The horses screamed and galloped on, heedless of their master. Meanwhile, the dead turned their heads as one, distracted from their meals by the racket. Annabel held on to the seat cushions as the cab rattled hard. It hadn’t been built for these speeds.
“Left!” Annabel called again.
They had to make this turn. Ahead, the road led into the heart of London. They needed to stay in London’s outskirts. If they made it into the more densely populated areas, the roads would be too crowded. There would be nowhere to run if they came across zombies. Crowded streets meant death.
“Make the turn!” she shouted.
The driver answered with the crack of his whip. Annabel felt the left side of the carriage actually lift off its wheels. It rattled and shook, threatening to topple onto its side as they tried to make the turn. They were going way too fast. They were going to crash.
Annabel leaned hard to one side. It was all she could do to balance the carriage. The wheels on the left side hit the pavement again, but only for a second. Then they lifted off again so they were only on two wheels, leaning hard to one side. The wheels screamed, grinding against the cobblestones.
Annabel braced herself for the crash. She held her breath and waited.
At last, they rattled around the corner. The wheels slammed back onto the road, kicking a few screws out of place. Miraculously, the carriage stayed upright. The cab strained against the pressure brought on by the breakneck pace, but it held.
“Nearly there, Miss,” the driver called.
She reminded herself to give him a generous tip. He had earned it. She just hoped there were no zombies where she was going.</Text>
            <Notes>The harsh sound of crows filled the air, their raucous voice a joyous dirge, a celebration of the feast. They swooped down and landed on the walking corpses, which tried to swat them away.</Notes>

Steampunk is a sub-genre of science fiction that typically features steam-powered machinery,[1] especially in a setting inspired by industrialized Western civilization during the 19th century. Therefore, steampunk works are often set in an alternative history of the 19th century's British Victorian era or American "Wild West", in a post-apocalyptic future during which steam power has regained mainstream use, or in a fantasy world that similarly employs steam power. Steampunk perhaps most recognizably features anachronistic technologies or retro-futuristic inventions as people in the 19th century might have envisioned them, and is likewise rooted in the era's perspective on fashion, culture, architectural style, and art. Such technology may include fictional machines like those found in the works of H. G. Wells and Jules Verne, or the modern authors Philip Pullman, Scott Westerfeld, Stephen Hunt and China Miéville. Other examples of steampunk contain alternate history-style presentations of such technology as lighter-than-air airships, analog computers, or such digital mechanical computers as Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.
Steampunk may also, though not necessarily, incorporate additional elements from the genres of fantasy, horror, historical fiction, alternate history, or other branches of speculative fiction, making it often a hybrid genre. The term steampunk's first known appearance was in 1987, though it now retroactively refers to many works of fiction created even as far back as the 1950s or 1960s.
Steampunk also refers to any of the artistic styles, clothing fashions, or subcultures, that have developed from the aesthetics of steampunk fiction, Victorian-era fiction, and films from the mid-20th century.[2] Various modern utilitarian objects have been modded by individual artisans into a pseudo-Victorian mechanical "steampunk" style, and a number of visual and musical artists have been described as steampunk.

History[edit]
Steampunk is influenced by, and often adopts the style of, the 19th-century scientific romances of Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, and Mary Shelley.[3]
20th-century precursors[edit]
Several works of art and fiction significant to the development of the genre were produced before the genre had a name. The oldest precursor of this genre in film, Fritz Lang's 1927 masterpiece, "Metropolis", may be the single most important early film to represent steampunk as an emerging stylistic genre. Titus Alone (1959), by Mervyn Peake, anticipated many of the tropes of steampunk.[4] Remedios Varo's paintings combine elements of Victorian dress, fantasy, and technofantasy imagery.[5] One of the earliest mainstream manifestations of the steampunk ethos was the original CBS television series The Wild Wild West (1965–69), which inspired the film Wild Wild West (1999).[3][6] The A Nomad of the Time Streams trilogy by Michael Moorcock, which began in 1971 with The Warlord of the Air, was also an influential precursor.[7] The film Brazil (1985) was an important early cinematic influence toward creating the genre.[8][9]
Origin of the term[edit]
Although many works now considered seminal to the genre were published in the 1960s and 1970s, the term steampunk originated in the late 1980s as a tongue in cheek variant of cyberpunk. It seems to have been coined by science fiction author K. W. Jeter, who was trying to find a general term for works by Tim Powers (The Anubis Gates, 1983); James Blaylock (Homunculus, 1986); and himself (Morlock Night, 1979, and Infernal Devices, 1987)—all of which took place in a 19th-century (usually Victorian) setting and imitated conventions of such actual Victorian speculative fiction as H. G. Wells' The Time Machine. In a letter to science fiction magazine Locus, printed in the April 1987 issue, Jeter wrote:
Dear Locus,
Enclosed is a copy of my 1979 novel Morlock Night; I'd appreciate your being so good as to route it Faren Miller, as it's a prime piece of evidence in the great debate as to who in "the Powers/Blaylock/Jeter fantasy triumvirate" was writing in the "gonzo-historical manner" first. Though of course, I did find her review in the March Locus to be quite flattering.
Personally, I think Victorian fantasies are going to be the next big thing, as long as we can come up with a fitting collective term for Powers, Blaylock and myself. Something based on the appropriate technology of the era; like 'steam-punks', perhaps.
—K.W. Jeter[10]
Modern steampunk[edit]
While Jeter's Morlock Night and Infernal Devices, Powers' The Anubis Gates, and Blaylock's Lord Kelvin's Machine were the first novels to which Jeter's neologism would be applied, they gave the term little thought at the time.[11] However, they were far from the first modern science fiction writers to speculate on the development of steam-based technology or alternative histories. Keith Laumer's Worlds of the Imperium (1962) and Ronald W. Clark's Queen Victoria's Bomb (1967) apply modern speculation to past-age technology and society.[12] Michael Moorcock's Warlord of the Air (1971)[13] is another early example. Harry Harrison's novel A Transatlantic Tunnel, Hurrah! (1973) portrays a British Empire of an alternative year 1973, full of atomic locomotives, coal-powered flying boats, ornate submarines, and Victorian dialogue. In February 1980 Richard A. Lupoff and Steve Stiles published the first "chapter" of their 10-part comic strip The Adventures of Professor Thintwhistle and His Incredible Aether Flyer.[14]
The first use of the word in a title was in Paul Di Filippo's 1995 Steampunk Trilogy,[15] consisting of three short novels: "Victoria", "Hottentots", and "Walt and Emily", which, respectively, imagine the replacement of Queen Victoria by a human/newt clone, an invasion of Massachusetts by Lovecraftian monsters, and a love affair between Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson.

Literary[edit]

Cover of Issue 3 of Steampunk Magazine
The 1981 educational book, Elementary BASIC - Learning to Program Your Computer in BASIC with Sherlock Holmes by Henry Singer and Andrew Ledgar may have been the first fictional work to depict the use of Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine in an adventure story. The instructional book, aimed at young programming students, depicts Holmes using the engine as an aid in his investigations, and offer program listings to perform simple data processing tasks required to solve the fictional cases. The book even describes a possible enhancement to Babbage's machine; a device that allows the engine to be used remotely, through telegraph lines. Companion volumes, Elementary Pascal - Learning to Program Your Computer in Pascal with Sherlock Holmes and From Baker Street to Binary - An Introduction to Computers and Computer Programming with Sherlock Holmes, were also written.
1988 saw the publication of the first version of the science fiction roleplaying game Space: 1889, set in an alternative history in which certain discredited Victorian scientific theories were probable, thus leading to new technologies. Contributing authors included Frank Chadwick, Loren Wiseman, and Marcus Rowland.[16]
William Gibson and Bruce Sterling's 1990 novel The Difference Engine is often credited with bringing widespread awareness of steampunk.[6][17] This novel applies the principles of Gibson and Sterling's cyberpunk writings to an alternative Victorian era where Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage's proposed steam-powered mechanical computer, which Babbage called a difference engine (a later, more general-purpose version was known as an analytical engine), was actually built, and led to the dawn of the information age more than a century "ahead of schedule". This setting was different than most steampunk settings in that it takes a dim and dark view of this future rather than the more prevalent utopian versions.
Nick Gevers's 2008 original anthology Extraordinary Engines features newer steampunk stories by some of the genre's writers, as well as other science fiction and fantasy writers experimenting with neo-Victorian conventions. A retrospective reprint anthology of steampunk fiction was released, also in 2008, by Tachyon Publications; edited by Ann and Jeff VanderMeer and appropriately entitled Steampunk, it is a collection of stories by James Blaylock, whose "Narbondo" trilogy is typically considered steampunk; Jay Lake, author of the novel Mainspring, sometimes labeled "clockpunk";[18] the aforementioned Michael Moorcock; as well as Jess Nevins, known for his annotations to The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.
While most of the original steampunk works had a historical setting,[citation needed] later works often place steampunk elements in a fantasy world with little relation to any specific historical era. Historical steampunk tends to be science fiction that presents an alternative history; it also contains real locales and persons from history with alternative fantasy technology. "Fantasy-world steampunk", such as China Miéville's Perdido Street Station, Alan Campbell's Scar Night, and Stephen Hunt's Jackelian novels, on the other hand, presents steampunk in a completely imaginary fantasy realm, often populated by legendary creatures coexisting with steam-era and other anachronistic technologies. However, the works of China Miéville and similar authors are sometimes referred to as belonging to the 'New Weird' rather than steampunk.
Self-described author of "far-fetched fiction" Robert Rankin has increasingly incorporated elements of steampunk into narrative worlds, both Victorian and re-imagined contemporary. In 2009, he was made a Fellow of the Victorian Steampunk Society.[19]
Victorian[edit]
In general, the category includes any recent science fiction that takes place in a recognizable historical period (sometimes an alternate history version of an actual historical period) in which the Industrial Revolution has already begun, but electricity is not yet widespread.[citation needed] It places an emphasis on steam- or spring-propelled gadgets. The most common historical steampunk settings are the Victorian and Edwardian eras, though some in this "Victorian steampunk" category can go as early as the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.
Some examples of this type include the novel The Difference Engine,[20] the comic book series League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, the Disney animated film Atlantis: The Lost Empire,[3] the Anime series Fullmetal Alchemist, Scott Westerfeld's books from Leviathan trilogy,[21] and the roleplaying game Space: 1889.[3] Some, such as the comic series Girl Genius,[3] have their own unique times and places despite partaking heavily of the flavor of historic times and settings.
Karel Zeman's film The Fabulous World of Jules Verne (1958) is a very early example of cinematic steampunk. Based on Jules Verne novels, Zeman's film imagines a past based on those novels which never was.[22] Another early example of historical steampunk in cinema includes Hayao Miyazaki's anime films such as Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986), containing many archetypal anachronisms characteristic of the steampunk genre.[23][24]
"Historical" steampunk usually leans more towards science fiction than fantasy, but a number of historical steampunk stories have incorporated magical elements as well. For example, Morlock Night, written by K. W. Jeter, revolves around an attempt by the wizard Merlin to raise King Arthur to save the Britain in 1892 from an invasion of Morlocks from the future.[6] The Anubis Gates by Tim Powers involves a cabal of magicians among the beggars and thieves of the early 19th-century London underworld.
Paul Guinan’s Boilerplate, a 'biography' of a robot in the late 19th century, began as a website that garnered international press coverage when people began believing that Photoshop images of the robot with historic personages were real.[25] The site was adapted into an illustrated hardbound book Boilerplate: History’s Mechanical Marvel, and published by Abrams in October 2009.[26] Because the story was not set in an alternative history, and in fact contained accurate information about the Victorian era,[27] some[specify] booksellers referred to the tome as "historical steampunk."
American West[edit]
Another setting is "Western" steampunk, which overlaps with both the Weird West and Science fiction Western subgenres. Several other categories have arisen, sharing similar names, including dieselpunk, clockpunk, and others. Most of these terms were coined as supplements to the GURPS roleplaying game, and are not used in other contexts.[28] Films and literature of this genre include High Moon, Far West, Briscoe County, Jr. Jonah Hex, and the Will Smith film Wild, Wild West.
Alternative world[edit]
Since the 1990s, the application of the steampunk label has expanded beyond works set in recognizable historical periods, to works set in fantasy worlds that rely heavily on steam- or spring-powered technology.[6]
Fantasy steampunk settings abound in tabletop and computer role-playing games. Notable examples include Skies of Arcadia,[29] Rise of Nations: Rise of Legends,[30] and Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura.[3]
The gnomes and goblins in World of Warcraft also have technological societies that could be described as steampunk[31] as they are vastly ahead of the technologies of men, but are not magical like those of the Elves.
Similarly in the role-playing game series The Elder Scrolls a race of Dwarves, the "Dwemer", are shown to utilise technology which is heavily influenced by steampunk, featuring giant cogs and visible moving parts, as well as steam power, as opposed to the more medieval-based technologies of the species of men, and the magic-based society of the Elven races.
Dungeons and Dragons introduced steampunk elements with the Eberron setting, including automatons called warforged and the use of "technological" magic through items such as the lightning rail and airships.
Amidst the historical and fantasy sub-genres of steampunk is a type which takes place in a hypothetical future or a fantasy equivalent of our future, involving the domination of steampunk-style technology and aesthetics. Examples include Jean-Pierre Jeunet &amp; Marc Caro's The City of Lost Children (1995), anime film Steamboy (2004), Turn A Gundam (1999–2000), Trigun, and Hayao Miyazaki's post-apocalyptic anime Future Boy Conan (1978),[32] and Disney's film Treasure Planet (2002). In 2011, musician Thomas Dolby heralded his return to music after a 20 year hiatus with an online steampunk alternate fantasy world called the Floating City, to promote his album, A Map of the Floating City.[3]
Fantasy and horror[edit]
See also: Cyberpunk derivatives
Kaja Foglio introduced the term "Gaslight Romance",[33] gaslamp fantasy, which John Clute and John Grant define as "steampunk stories ... most commonly set in a romanticized, smoky, 19th-century London, as are Gaslight Romances. But the latter category focuses nostalgically on icons from the late years of that century and the early years of the 20th century--on Dracula, Jekyll and Hyde, Jack the Ripper, Sherlock Holmes and even Tarzan--and can normally be understood as combining supernatural fiction and recursive fantasy, though some gaslight romances can be read as fantasies of history."[34] Some, such as author/artist James Richardson-Brown[35] use the term steamgoth to refer to steampunk expressions of fantasy and horror with a "darker" bent.
Television, film and video game[edit]
The 1965 television series The Wild Wild West, as well as the 1999 film, featured many of the elements of advanced steam-powered technology set in the Wild West time period of the United States.
The 1979 film Time After Time has Herbert George "H.G." Wells following a surgeon named John Leslie Stevenson into the future, as John is suspected of being Jack the Ripper. Both use Wells' time machine separately to travel.
The 1982 American TV series Q.E.D., set in Edwardian England, starred Sam Waterston as Professor Quentin Everett Deverill (the series title is the character's initials,as well as the Latin phrase quod erat demonstrandum, which translates as "which was to be demonstrated"). The Professor was an inventor and scientific detective, in the mold of Sherlock Holmes. In the show, the lead character was known primarily by his initials, Q.E.D.
The final scene of the 1990 film Back to the Future Part III implies that the protagonist Emmett Brown, after being stranded in 1880s California, has managed to adapt 1980s technology in a steam-powered context, including the development of a steam-powered train-based time machine.
The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., a Fox Network 1993 TV science fiction-western set in the 1890s, featured elements of steampunk as represented by the character Professor Wickwire, whose inventions were described as "the coming thing."[36] The short-lived 1995 TV show Legend on UPN, set in 1876 Arizona, featured such classic inventions as a steam-driven "quadrovelocipede" and night-vision goggles, and starred John de Lancie as a thinly-disguised Nicola Tesla. Alan Moore's and Kevin O'Neill's 1999 The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen graphic novel series (and the subsequent 2003 film adaption) greatly popularized the steampunk genre.[37] The Syfy series Warehouse 13 features many steampunk-inspired objects and artifacts, including computer designs created by steampunk artisan Richard Nagy, aka "Datamancer".[38] Also, the Syfy miniseries Tin Man incorporates a considerable amount of steampunk-inspired themes into a re-imagining of L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.
The BBC series Doctor Who also incorporates steampunk elements in the design of the Doctor's time machine,[citation needed] the TARDIS, first presented in the 1996 American co-production when the TARDIS interior was re-designed to resemble an almost Victorian library with the central control console made up of eclectic and anachronistic objects. Modified and streamlined for the 2005 revival of the series, the TARDIS console continues to incorporate steampunk elements, including a Victorian typewriter and gramophone. Steampunk has begun to attract notice from more "mainstream" sources as well. For example, the episode of the TV series Castle entitled "Punked", which aired on October 11, 2010, prominently featured the steampunk subculture and used Los Angeles-area steampunks as extras[39] Syfy channel's 2013 series Robot Combat League features one robot named "Steampunk", looking much like a giant brass boiler with pressure gauges for eyes.[40] The music videos from both David Guetta's "Turn Me On" and Panic at the Disco's "The Ballad of Mona Lisa" have drawn heavily on steampunk inspirations.
The 19th-century detective series Murdoch Mysteries occasionally incorporates elements of steampunk. In the 2012 episode Who Killed the Electric Carriage?, for instance, an inventor develops an electric car that runs on NiCd batteries charged by solar cells, only to have Henry Ford and Standard Oil buy out his company and patents and kill the project. In many episodes, Murdoch himself envisions or invents futuristic devices using contemporary materials.
The Nickelodeon animated series The Legend of Korra is set in a steampunk setting, with 20th-century cars, steam engines and ships and Industrial Revolution clothes.
The Chaos Engine is a run and gun video game inspired by the Gibson/Sterling novel The Difference Engine, set in a Victorian steampunk age. Developed by the Bitmap Brothers, it was first released on the Amiga in 1993 with a sequel appearing in 1996.[41] Other steampunk-styled video games include 1994's Final Fantasy VI on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and Bioshock Infinite for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 systems, as well as PC and Mac home computers.
The entire Myst series of video games employ 19th century style, steam and electric powered gadgets and machinery in beautiful, yet surreal environments.
The massively-multiplayer online game Guild Wars 2 has a race known as the Charr, who live in the non-specific steampunk capital city called the Black Citadel. The city is heavily mechanized and industrial and their focus is on the building of war machines.
The video game BioShock Infinite contains elements of steampunk, especially in the design of the game's main location, the floating city of Columbia.
The video game Dishonored is set in a dystopian steampunk world, and the weapons Corvo and his enemies use (like the crossbow or the gun) are steampunk too, but technology is run on a volatile and fictional substance called whale oil.
Steamboy is a 2004 film by director Katsuhiro Otomo based in 1860's England and is entirely set in a steampunk environment. The plot revolves around a boy, his grandfather and father and an exciting but dangerous advancement in steampunk power. It is cited as one of the most expensive Japanese animated movies made to date.
The comic book series of Hellboy created by Mike Mignola and the two Hellboy films featuring Ron Perlman and directed by Guillermo del Toro all have steampunk elements. In the comic book and the first (2004) film, Karl Ruprecht Kroenen is a Nazi SS scientist who has an addiction to surgery and had many mechanical prostheses, not least a clockwork heart. Johann Krauss features in the comic and in the second film, Hellboy II: The Golden Army, and is an ectoplasmic medium (a gaseous form in a partly mechanical suit). This second film also features the Golden Army itself which is a collection of 70 x 70 mechanical steampunk warriors.

Many of the visualizations of steampunk have their origins with, among others, Walt Disney's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,[42] including the design of the story's submarine the Nautilus, its interiors, and the crew's underwater gear; and George Pal's 1960 film The Time Machine, with the design of the time machine itself. This theme is also carried over to Disney's theme parks in the design of The Mysterious Island section of Tokyo DisneySea theme park, and Disneyland Paris' Discoveryland area.
Steampunk design emphasizes a balance between the form and function.[43] Like the Arts and Crafts Movement, this blurs the line between tool and decoration. Various modern utilitarian objects have been modified by enthusiasts into a pseudo-Victorian mechanical "steampunk" style.[9][44] Example objects include computer keyboards and electric guitars.[45] The goal of such redesigns is to employ appropriate materials (such as polished brass, iron, wood, and leather) with design elements and craftsmanship consistent with the Victorian era,[13][46] rejecting the aesthetic of industrial design.[43]
The artist group Kinetic Steam Works[47] brought a working steam engine to the Burning Man festival in 2006 and 2007.[48] The group's founding member, Sean Orlando, created a Steampunk Tree House (in association with a group of people who would later form the Five Ton Crane Arts Group[49]) that has been displayed at a number of festivals.[50][51] The Steampunk Tree House is now permanently installed at the Dogfish Head Brewery in Milton, Delaware.[52][53]
In May–June 2008, multimedia artist and sculptor Paul St George exhibited outdoor interactive video installations linking London and Brooklyn, New York, in a Victorian era-styled telectroscope.[54][55] Utilizing this device, New York promoter Evelyn Kriete organized a transatlantic wave between steampunk enthusiasts from both cities,[56] briefly prior to White Mischief's Around the World in 80 Days steampunk-themed event.[57]

In 2009 artist Tim Wetherell created a large wall piece for Questacon representing the concept of the clockwork universe. This steel artwork contains moving gears, a working clock, and a movie of the moon's terminator in action. The 3D moon movie was created by Antony Williams.
From October 2009 through February 2010, the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford hosted the first major exhibition of steampunk art objects, curated and developed by New York artist and designer, Art Donovan who also exhibited his own "electro-futuristic" lighting sculptures and presented by Dr. Jim Bennett, museum director.[58] From redesigned practical items to fantastical contraptions, this exhibition showcased the work of eighteen steampunk artists from across the globe. The exhibition proved to be the most successful and highly attended in the museum's history and attracted more than eighty thousand visitors. The event was detailed in the official artist's journal, "The Art of Steampunk" by curator Donovan.[59]

In November 2010, The Libratory Steampunk Art Gallery[60] was opened by Damien McNamara in Oamaru, New Zealand. Created from papier-mâché to resemble a large subterranean cave and filled with industrial equipment from yesteryear, rayguns and general steampunk quirks. Its purpose is to provide a place for steampunkers in the region to display artwork all year long.

In 2012, the Mobilis in Mobili: An Exhibition of Steampunk Art and Appliance art exhibit made its debut. Originally located at New York City's Wooster Street Social Club (itself the subject of the television series NY Ink), the exhibit featured working steampunk tattoo systems designed, respectively, by Bruce Rosenbaum of ModVic and owner of the Steampunk House,[61] Joey "Dr. Grymm" Marsocci.,[45] and Christopher Conte[62] showing very different approaches.[42] "bicycles, cell phones, guitars, timepieces and entertainment systems"[62] rounded out the display.[45]
In 2013, IBM predicted, based on an analysis of more than a half million public posts on message boards, blogs, social media sites and news sources, "that ‘steampunk,’ a sub-genre inspired by the clothing, technology and social mores of Victorian society, will be a major trend to bubble up and take hold of the retail industry." [63][64]
Music[edit]
Steampunk music is very broadly defined, as Caroline Sullivan says in The Guardian: "Internet debates rage about exactly what constitutes the steampunk sound."[55] Abney Park’s lead singer, Robert Brown, very loosely defined it as, "mixing Victorian elements and modern elements."[65]
Joshua Pfeiffer (of Vernian Process) is quoted as saying “As for Paul Roland, if anyone deserves credit for spear-heading Steampunk music, it is him. He was one of the inspirations I had in starting my project. He was writing songs about the first attempt at manned flight, and an Edwardian airship raid in the mid-80’s long before almost anyone else…”.[66] Thomas Dolby is also considered one of the early pioneers of retro-futurist (i.e. steampunk and dieselpunk) music.[65][67] Amanda Palmer was once quoted as saying, "Thomas Dolby is to Steampunk what Iggy Pop was to Punk!"[68]
The broad range of steampunk musical styles can be heard in the work of various steampunk artists, from the industrial dance/world music of Abney Park,[69] the folk rock of Steam Powered Giraffe, the straightforward punk of The Men That Will Not Be Blamed For Nothing,[70][71] the inventor/singer-songwriter creations of Thomas Truax or of the 'mad scientist' of 1980s fame, Thomas Dolby,[55][72] the Carnatic influenced music of Sunday Driver,[73] the "industrial hip-hop opera" of Doctor Steel,[74][75] the darkwave and progressive rock sounds of Vernian Process,[76][77] the Unextraordinary Gentlemen,[78] the electronic sounds of The Wet-Glass RO,[79][80] Darcy James Argue's 18-piece big band Secret Society and the musical storytelling of Escape the Clouds or Tom Slatter.[81] The British-American composer David Bruce's 2010 octet Steampunk was commissioned by Carnegie Hall.[82][83]
Steampunk has also appeared in the work of musicians who do not specifically identify as steampunk. For example, the music video of Turn Me On by David Guetta featuring Nicki Minaj takes place in a steampunk universe where Guetta creates human droids. In addition, the 2012 album Clockwork Angels and its supporting tour by progressive rock band Rush contain lyrics, themes and imagery based around steampunk.
In 2012, Thomas Dolby headlined the first "Steamstock" outdoor steampunk music festival in Richmond, CA, alongside steampunk favorites Abney Park, Vernian Process, Lee Presson and the Nails and others.[67]
Culture and community[edit]
￼

Because of the popularity of steampunk, there is a growing movement towards establishing steampunk as a culture and lifestyle.[84] Some fans of the genre adopt a steampunk aesthetic through fashion,[85] home decor, music, and film. This may be described as neo-Victorianism, which is the amalgamation of Victorian aesthetic principles with modern sensibilities and technologies.[8]
In September 2012, a panel was held at Stan Lee's Comikaze Expo, chaired by steampunk entertainer Veronique Chevalier and with panelists including magician Pop Hadyn and members of the steampunk performance group The League of STEAM, which suggested that because steampunk was inclusive of and encorporated ideas from various other subcultures such as goth, neo-Victorian, and cyberpunk as well as a growing number of fandoms, it was fast becoming a super-culture rather than a mere subculture.[86] Other steampunk notables such as Professor Elemental have expressed similar views about steampunk's inclusive diversity.[87]
Some have proposed a steampunk philosophy, sometimes with punk-inspired anti-establishment sentiments, and typically bolstered by optimism about human potential.[88]

Steampunk fashion has no set guidelines, but tends to synthesize modern styles influenced by the Victorian era. This may include gowns, corsets, petticoats and bustles; suits with vests, coats, top hats[89] and spats; or military-inspired garments. Steampunk-influenced outfits are usually accented with several technological and period accessories: timepieces, parasols, flying/driving goggles, and ray guns. Modern accessories like cell phones or music players can be found in steampunk outfits, after being modified to give them the appearance of Victorian-made objects. Aspects of steampunk fashion have been anticipated by mainstream high fashion, the Lolita fashion and aristocrat styles, neo-Victorianism, and the romantic goth subculture.[8][37][69]
Steampunk became a common descriptor for homemade objects on the craft network Etsy between 2009 and 2011,[citation needed] though many of the objects and fashions bear little resemblance to earlier established steampunk descriptions. Thus the craft network may not strike observers as 'sufficiently steampunk' to warrant the description. Comedienne April Winchell, author of the book, Regretsy: Where DIY meets WTF, catalogs some of the most egregious and humorous examples on her website, "Regretsy".[90] The blog is popular among steampunks and even inspired a music video that went viral in the community and was acclaimed by steampunk notables.[91]
Social events[edit]
￼
￼
"Wave Gotik Treffen" Leipzig/Germany Alexander Schlesier
2006 saw the first "SalonCon", a neo-Victorian/steampunk convention. It ran for three consecutive years and featured artists, musicians (Voltaire and Abney Park), authors (Catherynne M. Valente, Ekaterina Sedia, and G. D. Falksen), salons led by people prominent in their respective fields, workshops and panels on steampunk—as well as a seance, ballroom dance instruction, and the Chrononauts' Parade. The event was covered by MTV[92] and The New York Times.[8] Since then a number of popular steampunk conventions have sprung up the world over, with names like Steamcon (Seattle, WA), the Steampunk World's Fair (Piscataway, NJ) and Up in the Aether: The Steampunk Convention (Dearborn, MI).[93]
Steampunk has also become a regular feature at San Diego Comic-Con International in recent years, with the Saturday of the four-day event being generally known among steampunks as "Steampunk Day", and culminating with a photo-shoot for the local press.[94][95] In 2010 this was recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's largest steampunk photo shoot.[96] The Saturday steampunk "after-party" has also become a major event on the steampunk social calendar; in 2010 the headliners included The Slow Poisoner, Unextraordinary Gentlemen and Voltaire, with Veronique Chevalier as Mistress of Ceremonies and special appearance by the League of STEAM,[97][98] and in 2011 UXG returned with Abney Park.[99]
Steampunk also has sprung up recently at Renaissance Festivals and Renaissance Faires, nationwide. Some have organized events or a "Steampunk Day", while other Fests simply support an open environment for donning Steampunk attire. The Bristol Renaissance Faire in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on the Wisconsin/Illinois border, featured a Steampunk costume contest during the 2012 season. The previous two seasons featured increasing participation in the phenomenon.[100]
Steampunk also has a growing following in the UK and Europe. The largest European event is "Weekend at the Asylum", held at The Lawn, Lincoln every September since 2009. Organized as a not-for-profit event by the Victorian Steampunk Society, the Asylum is a dedicated steampunk event which takes over much of the historical quarter of Lincoln, England, along with Lincoln Castle. In 2011 there were over 1000 steampunks in attendance. The event features the Empire Ball, Majors Review, Bazaar Eclectica and the international Tea Duelling final.[citation needed]

            <Title>“Monsieur Steen</Title>
            <Text>“Monsieur Steen! Monsieur Steen!” the petit Frenchman cried, weaving through a crowd of pedestrians, bumping into passersby and causing baguettes and oranges to spill onto the ground, and trying to keep up with his employer.
Roderick, meanwhile, had selective hearing. He sashayed through the throng of pedestrians, parting the sea like a foppish Moses, and pretended not to hear Sébastien. He tapped his cane musically on the sidewalk.
“Come along, Sébastien,” he called behind him. “Let’s take a stroll along the Seine.”
Sébastien had his arms full with art supplies—a whole suitcase worth of paints and brushes—as they had just been to Roderick’s supplier, and he was also trying to keep Bailey in line. The Yorkshire Terrier continued to pull at the lead whenever he smelt a squirrel or a pigeon. Consequently, Sébastien was in very grave danger of dropping something.
“But Monsieur!” he called, “your studio is that way!”
Roderick’s cheeks dimpled. He didn’t know why he enjoyed torturing Sébastien so much, but he did. He couldn’t help it. Perhaps it was that the small Frenchman reminded him of Rémy Vaillancourt, who’d survived Dead London only to leave Roderick over an argument Roderick could no longer even remember. Everything in Paris reminded him of Rémy. He sighed wistfully.
“Ah, mon cher,” he said to the wind. Finally, he stopped to allow Sébastien and Bailey to catch up. He smiled into the glorious sunshine and stretched his arms to bask in its warmth, while his assistant panted to catch his breath and Bailey raised a leg and marked a lamp post.
“Sir—” he heaved, “we’re—going—the—”
“Wrong way?” said Roderick. “Sébastien, my love, we’re in Paris. There is no wrong way. The sun is shining, there is the scent of freshly baked bread on every corner, and I can hear distant accordions playing Frère Jacques. What’s your rush?”
Sébastien gave his employer a meaningful look and indicated his armfuls of baggage. Roderick sighed.
“Very well,” he relented, taking Bailey to lighten the load. “Away we go.”
Without another word, Roderick changed direction began the parade down the promenade, his colorful scarf trailing in the wind and his assistant quickly falling behind again.
He noticed a beautiful woman stopping to look through a baker’s window at the croissants sitting on the shelf. She had the most striking auburn eyes, skin the color of rich caramel, and dark hair in neat cornrows. He had just seen her up ahead a minute earlier, when he’d been heading the other way. Roderick had an eidetic memory, which was one of the secrets to his success as an artist; he could paint a model without needing a reference. He was certain he’d seen her standing ahead of them before changing directions, and now she was ahead of them again. Had she doubled back and slipped past them unnoticed?
He noticed Bailey’s hackles raising, and the dog’s little teeth poking out. He gave a low growl, which was unusual. Bailey was usually very friendly.
“Bonjour,” he said politely.
She smiled and looked up from the window as he passed. “Bonjour.”
She returned her attention to the window as Roderick looked over his shoulder and waited for Sébastien to catch up again. He had to tug at the leash to keep Bailey from the woman. As soon as he continued on his way, the woman turned away from the shop and began following them.
Roderick took a sudden turn, acting as though he was pursuing a sudden flight of fancy. Bailey yelped in protest, and so did Sébastien.
“What!” cried the flustered Frenchman. “Your studio is that way, Monsieur Steen! That way!”
“Shortcut,” Roderick answered, jaunting across the street in front of a hackney. The driver shouted a curse at him and pulled at the reins to stop his horse from running Roderick over. Ignoring the irate driver, Roderick ducked into a narrow alleyway and gestured for Sébastien to hurry up. His assistant joined him. Not a moment later, the woman headed down the same street, looked both ways, then crossed the street toward the alley.
“I knew it,” Roderick said under his breath. “I knew Bailey wouldn’t get so agitated over nothing.”
He turned to Sébastien. “We’ve got trouble,” he said, urging him onward. He darted down a winding street, leading them even further from his studio. “We’re being followed. Leave the suitcase if you have to, Sébastien, but whatever you do, keep up.”
Sébastien’s face flushed. “Leave the suitcase?” he protested. “Do you know how much all that paint is worth?”
“It isn’t worth more than your life,” Roderick answered. “Now, come. We’ve got to get going.”</Text>

            <Title>“However, I have come up with another theory. As I</Title>
            <Text>“However, I have come up with another theory. As I said, Dr. Allen was tasked with creating an army of superior soldiers, using both surgical and pharmaceutical technologies. When I began my research into Dr. Allen’s activities, I stumbled across a subject that at first seemed to bear no relevance to the case, but which upon further consideration I realized was absolutely critical in understanding Dr. Allen’s motives.” He turned to Henry Ocelot. “Are you familiar with the term houngan?”
“A vodoun word,” said Ocelot, “A houngan is a sorceror, a practitioner of dark magic.”
“Magic, yes,” said Mr. Sinews, “I have heard it said that occasionally science is indistinguishable from magic.”
“You’re saying…?” said Jonathan.
“The story I read about a particular houngan, living in Haiti, apparently involved bringing a man back from the dead. However, when the man returned to life he was subject to the whims of the sorceror. A zombie, forced to do the houngan’s bidding. The resurrected man, according to the man who penned this particularly interesting article, was not actually under a vodou spell. There was no magic involved at all; he had been poisoned with a particularly potent powder: a concoction involving the neurotoxins of a pufferfish, which can induce a death-like state convincing enough to fool even the most scrutinous of doctors. The other ingredients were behaviour-altering drugs. Pharmaceutical powders which could induce susceptibility to suggestion, cause delirium and cause memories to vanish from the victim’s mind. After reading the article, I found myself wondering if this might not be the sort of thing Dr. Allen might have been experimenting with. Would not a zombie make the perfect soldier? A man with no memories and no free will of his own, a soldier who would blindly follow the orders of his general? A leap of logic, perhaps, but nonetheless plausible, wouldn’t you agree?”
“It is possible,” Ocelot agreed after a pause.
“At first I was sceptical of my own theory. I attempted to track down the article’s author. I hit several dead ends but eventually discovered evidence to suggest that it was written by Dr. Allen himself. It was signed James Vane, either an earlier pseudonym of the doctor or his birth name. At any rate, it was evidence enough that Allen had been studying that particular drug. I expanded upon my original theory. I hypothesized that not only had Dr. Allen managed to replicate this vodoun concoction, but that it had been administered on the doctor himself. </Text>

Cyberpunk derivatives
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
  (Redirected from Clockpunk)
Jump to: navigation, search
A number of cyberpunk derivatives have become recognized as distinct subgenres in speculative fiction. These derivatives, though they do not share cyberpunk's computers-focused setting, may display other qualities drawn from or analogous to cyberpunk: a world built on one particular technology that is extrapolated to a highly sophisticated level (this may even be a fantastical or anachronistic technology, akin to retro-futurism), a gritty transreal urban style, or a particular approach to social themes.
Many, but not all, of these subgenres have the suffix -punk in their names, having been added in a continuing play on the habit of creating portmanteau words as in the cyber/steam-punk naming convention.

Cyberpunk[edit]
American author Bruce Bethke first coined the term "cyberpunk" in his 1980 short story of the same name, proposing it as a label for a new generation of punk teenagers inspired by the perceptions inherent to the Information Age.[1] The term was quickly appropriated as a label to be applied to the works of William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, John Shirley, Rudy Rucker, Michael Swanwick, Pat Cadigan, Lewis Shiner, Richard Kadrey, and others. Science fiction author Lawrence Person, in defining postcyberpunk, summarized the characteristics of cyberpunk thus:
Classic cyberpunk characters were marginalized, alienated loners who lived on the edge of society in generally dystopic futures where daily life was impacted by rapid technological change, an ubiquitous datasphere of computerized information, and invasive modification of the human body.[2]
The relevance of cyberpunk as a genre to punk subculture is debatable and further hampered by the lack of a defined cyberpunk subculture; where the small cyber movement shares themes with cyberpunk fiction and draws inspiration from punk and goth alike, cyberculture is much more popular though much less defined, encompassing virtual communities and cyberspace in general and typically embracing optimistic anticipations about the future. Cyberpunk is nonetheless regarded as a successful genre, as it ensnared many new readers and provided the sort of movement that postmodern literary critics found alluring. Furthermore, author David Brin argues, cyberpunk made science fiction more attractive and profitable for mainstream media and the visual arts in general.[3]
Postcyberpunk[edit]
As new writers and artists began to experiment with cyberpunk ideas, new varieties of fiction emerged, sometimes addressing the criticisms leveled at the original cyberpunk stories. Lawrence Person wrote in an essay he posted to the Internet forum Slashdot in 1998:
Many writers who grew up reading in the 1980s are just now starting to have their stories and novels published. To them cyberpunk was not a revolution or alien philosophy invading science fiction, but rather just another flavor of science fiction. Like the writers of the 1970s and 80s who assimilated the New Wave's classics and stylistic techniques without necessarily knowing or even caring about the manifestos and ideologies that birthed them, today's new writers might very well have read Neuromancer back to back with Asimov's Foundation, John Brunner's Stand on Zanzibar, and Larry Niven's Ringworld and seen not discontinuities but a continuum.[2]
Person's essay advocates using the term postcyberpunk to label the new works such writers produce. In this view, typical postcyberpunk stories continue the focus on social implications within a post-third industrial-era society, such as a ubiquitous datasphere of computerized information and cybernetic augmentation of the human body, but without the assumption of dystopia (see Technological utopianism). Good examples are Neal Stephenson's The Diamond Age and Bruce Sterling's Holy Fire. In television, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex has been called "the most interesting, sustained postcyberpunk media work in existence."[4] In 2007, SF writers James Patrick Kelly and John Kessel published Rewired: The Post-Cyberpunk Anthology. Like all categories discerned within science fiction, the boundaries of postcyberpunk are likely to be fluid or ill defined.[5]
Cyberprep[edit]
Cyberprep is a term with a very similar meaning to postcyberpunk. The word is a portmanteau combining "cybernetics" and "preppy", reflecting its divergence from the punk elements of cyberpunk. A cyberprep world assumes that all the technological advancements of cyberpunk speculation have taken place but life is happy rather than gritty and dangerous.[6] Since society is leisure-driven, uploading is more of an art form or a medium of entertainment while advanced body modifications are used for sports and pleasure.
Retrofuturistic derivatives[edit]
As a wider variety of writers began to work with cyberpunk concepts, new sub-genres of science fiction emerged, playing off the cyberpunk label, and focusing on technology and its social effects in different ways. Many derivatives of cyberpunk are retro-futuristic, based either on the futuristic visions of past eras, especially from the first and second revolution technological-eras, or more recent extrapolations or exaggerations of the actual technology of those eras.
Steampunk[edit]
Main article: Steampunk
The word "steampunk" was invented in 1987 as a jocular reference to some of the novels of Tim Powers, James P. Blaylock, and K. W. Jeter. When Gibson and Sterling entered the subgenre with their collaborative novel The Difference Engine the term was being used earnestly as well.[7] Alan Moore's and Kevin O'Neill's 1999 The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen comic book series (and the subsequent 2003 film adaption) popularized the steampunk genre and helped propel it into mainstream fiction.[8]
The most immediate form of steampunk subculture is the community of fans surrounding the genre. Others move beyond this, attempting to adopt a "steampunk" aesthetic through fashion, home decor and even music. This movement may also be (perhaps more accurately) described as "Neo-Victorianism," which is the amalgamation of Victorian aesthetic principles with modern sensibilities and technologies. This characteristic is particularly evident in steampunk fashion which tends to synthesize punk, goth and rivet styles as filtered through the Victorian era. As an object style, however, steampunk adopts more distinct characteristics with various craftspersons modding modern-day devices into a pseudo-Victorian mechanical "steampunk" style.[9] The goal of such redesigns is to employ appropriate materials (such as polished brass, iron, and wood) with design elements and craftsmanship consistent with the Victorian era.[10]
Teslapunk[edit]

Teslapunk is a subgenre of speculative fiction which is similar to steampunk, named for scientist and inventor Nikola Tesla, and refers to fictional narratives or visual styles inspired by 18th, 19th, and early 20th century pioneers of electricity and electrical devices. This narrative or style commonly imagines an alternate history where widely available cheap (or free), clean, and often highly portable electrical energy replaces all previous energy sources (such as wood, coal and oil, and the steam engines that were fueled by them), but has yet to be replaced (or is never replaced) by other energy sources itself (such as diesel or nuclear power). In some stories, free-energy technologies are largely forgotten in the present day, but only because they were kept secret by some government or other organization that used the technologies to control the masses.[11]
Dieselpunk[edit]
￼
￼
Dieselpunk
Dieselpunk is an art style based on the aesthetics popular between World War I and the end of World War II. The style combines the artistic and genre influences of the period (including pulp magazines, serial films, film noir, art deco, and wartime pin-ups) with postmodern[clarification needed] technology and sensibilities. First coined in 2001 as a marketing term by game designer Lewis Pollak to describe his role-playing game Children of the Sun,[12][13] dieselpunk has grown to describe a distinct style of visual art, music, motion pictures, fiction, and engineering. Examples include Rocketeer, The Legend of Korra, Crimson Skies, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, Dark City, Greed Corp, Gatling Gears, Iron Sky, the BioShock series, K-20: Legend of the Mask and Skullgirls.[14]
Decopunk[edit]
Decopunk is a recent subset of the Steampunk genre, centered around the Art Deco and Streamline Moderne art styles, and based around the period between the 20s and 50s. In an interview[15] at CoyoteCon, steampunk author Sara M. Harvey made the distinctions "...shinier than DieselPunk, more like DecoPunk." and "DieselPunk is a gritty version of Steampunk set in the 1920s-1950s. The big war eras, specifically. DecoPunk is the sleek, shiny very Art Deco version; same time period, but everything is chrome!"
The term was also independently proposed[16] for the movie Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow and the video game BioShock.
Atompunk[edit]

Atompunk relates to the pre-digital period of 1945-1965, including mid-century Modernism, the Atomic Age and Space Age, Communism and concern about it exaggerated as paranoia in the USA along with Neo-Soviet styling, underground cinema, Googie architecture, the Sputnik programme, superhero fiction, the rise of the US military/industrial powers and the fall-out of Chernobyl. Its aesthetic tends toward Populuxe and Raygun Gothic, which describe a retro-futuristic vision of the world.[17] Examples include the Fallout series and Destroy All Humans!.
Futuristic derivatives[edit]
Biopunk[edit]
Main article: Biopunk
Biopunk emerged during the 1990s and focuses on the near-future unintended consequences of the biotechnology revolution following the discovery of recombinant DNA. Biopunk fiction typically describes the struggles of individuals or groups, often the product of human experimentation, against a backdrop of totalitarian governments or megacorporations which misuse biotechnologies as means of social control or profiteering. Unlike cyberpunk, it builds not on information technology but on synthetic biology. As in postcyberpunk however, individuals are usually modified and enhanced not with cyberware, but by genetic manipulation of their chromosomes.
Nanopunk[edit]
Main article: Nanopunk
Nanopunk refers to an emerging genre of speculative science fiction still very much in its infancy in comparison to other genres like that of cyberpunk.[18] The genre is similar to biopunk, but describes a world in which the use of biotechnology is limited or prohibited, and only nanites and nanotechnology is in wide use (while in biopunk bio- and nanotechnologies often coexist). Currently the genre is more concerned with the artistic and physiological impact of nanotechnology, than of aspects of the technology itself.[19]
Other proposed derivatives[edit]
There have been a handful of divergent terms based on the general concepts of steampunk. These are typically considered unofficial and are often invented by readers, or by authors referring to their own works, often humorously.
A large number of terms have been used by the GURPS roleplaying game Steampunk to describe anachronistic technologies and settings, including stonepunk, bronzepunk, sandalpunk, candlepunk, and transistorpunk. These terms have seen very little use outside of GURPS.[20]
Stonepunk[edit]
Stonepunk refers to works set roughly during the Stone Age in which the characters utilize Neolithic Revolution-era technology constructed from materials more or less consistent with the time period, but possessing anachronistic complexity and function. The Flintstones franchise and its various spin offs, would fall under this category as well as Roland Emmerich's 10,000 BC. Literary examples include Edgar Rice Burrough's Back to the Stone Age and The Land that Time Forgot, and Jean M. Auel's "Earth’s Children" series, starting with The Clan of the Cave Bear.[21]
Clockpunk[edit]
Clockpunk is similar to steampunk in that it portrays Renaissance-era science and technology based on pre-modern designs, in the vein of Mainspring by Jay Lake,[22] and Whitechapel Gods by S. M. Peters.[23]
The term was coined by the GURPS role playing system.[20]
Nowpunk[edit]
Nowpunk is a term invented by Bruce Sterling, which he applied to contemporary fiction set in the time period in which the fiction is being published, i.e. all contemporary fiction. Sterling used the term to describe his book The Zenith Angle, which follows the story of a hacker whose life is changed by the September 11th, 2001 attacks.[24]
Splatterpunk[edit]

Main article: Splatterpunk
Splatterpunk, a term that David J. Schow coined in the mid-1980s at the World Fantasy Convention in Providence, refers to a subgenre of horror fiction distinguished by its graphic, often gory, depiction of violence.[25] Though it gained some prominence in the 1980s and 1990s, and attracted a cult following, the term "splatterpunk" is currently used less often than other synonymous terms for the genre.[26]
Elfpunk[edit]
Elfpunk was proposed as a subgenre of urban fantasy in which faeries and elves are transplanted from rural folklore into modern urban settings. During the awards ceremony for the 2007 National Book Awards, judge Elizabeth Partridge expounded on the distinction between elfpunk and urban fantasy, citing fellow judge Scott Westerfeld's thoughts on the works of Holly Black who is considered "classic elfpunk — there's enough creatures already, and she's using them. Urban fantasy, though, can have additionally made-up creatures."[27]
Mythpunk[edit]
Catherynne M. Valente uses the term "mythpunk" to describe a subgenre of mythic fiction which starts in folklore and myth and adds elements of postmodern techniques. Writers whose works would fall under the mythpunk label are Ekaterina Sedia, Theodora Goss, and Sonya Taaffe.[28]

            <Text>Wobbling slightly from the turbulence and the drink, Jonathan stood at the window, looking down at the toy-sized trees and river below. The airship’s speed never failed to astonish him.
“No sign of the thing yet,” he announced, turning back to face the gentlemen who’d assembled in the room.
The first was Henri-Charles Ocelot, a Haitian gentleman once employed by Parson Sinews as a valet. They’d crossed paths about a year ago, which was not entirely surprising given their mutual interest in locating Mr. Sinews, and it had seemed prudent to combine their efforts. He’d been aboard the Dreadful ever since. The man was fearsome in appearance, with one pale blue eye and one bright red; chipped and gold-capped teeth; and a necklace made of bones painted to look like brass. Contrary to appearances, he had an uncommonly gentle disposition, and Jonathan owed him his life.
The second man was Dr. Sound, a bookish professor appointed by the Crown to serve aboard the airship.
The monarchy officially opposed the Resurrectionist occupation of London, but in Jonathan’s opinion, the Crown actively continued to enable the Resurrectionists. Their base of operations was reputed to be somewhere underground, beneath London, within the quarantine zone, which was guarded heavily by the British military. So in a sense, the Resurrectionist scientists who destroyed London by unleashing the Lazarus Virus were now being protected by the military. So while Queen Victoria had sanctioned and now funded the Penny Dreadful’s operations and supported the crew’s mandate—to hunt and kill escaped zombies and track down any known Resurrectionists—Jonathan didn’t trust Her Royal Majesty’s motives. He regarded Dr. Sylvester Sound, therefore, with suspicion.
“In your opinion, Doctor, what do you think we’re likely to find?”
“Difficult to say, sir—”
“Plenty of things are difficult. Do make an effort.”
The professor frowned and ran a finger over his waxed mustache. “Very well,” he said. “The report we received suggested we would find—and I quote—an ‘abomination.’ As to what sort of abomination, I can only speculate, but please, allow me to do so. As we now know, death is a condition with varying degrees of finality. Zombies, for want of a more scientific term, are not actually dead. Their infection keeps their brains active, although their bodies continue to rot away. Despite continuing studies into the matter, there is still a great deal we don’t understand about the Lazarus Virus.”
“Yes, yes,” said Jonathan. He stood and headed over to the bar for another drink. “We all know how Lazarus works. This isn’t exactly our first tea party.”
“Yes, well,” the scientist continued, “here’s where it gets really interesting. What do you know about the Lazarus Virus’s interactions with non-human species?”
Jonathan shrugged. “Enlighten us,” he said.
“All right, well, as you may have read in the reports your crew retrieved from the Resurrectionist laboratory beneath the Albion, the virus can infect some non-human species, and when it does, the results are even less predictable. Some animals react much like men; they die, then subsequently revive as terrifying, unthinking cadavers with no recollection of their former selves and no loyalty to their former masters. Other animals show no signs of infection whatsoever; in particular, carrion birds tend not to react to the disease.”
“Hence the Resurrectionists’ experiments with crows,” Jonathan contributed. He’d seen the crows in the Resurrectionist laboratory. Anthony Tidkins, the leader of the Resurrectionists had been obsessed with them.
“Aside from carrion birds, we’ve yet to see any insects infected with the virus, although the reports from the Resurrectionist lab indicate that insects can contract the virus. Given that many insects are carrion-eaters, we should have seen cases of zombie insects, unless there are more factors at play. This is merely a working hypothesis, mind you, but I believe it takes more for an insect to become infected than merely being exposed to the virus.”
“Such as?”
“Haven’t the foggiest,” Dr. Sound replied, “but what I can tell you is this: according to the Resurrectionist files, the infected insects they observed underwent a dramatic metamorphosis. In layman’s terms, they transformed. Like a tadpole into a frog.”
Jonathan shared a look with Henri-Charles.
“According to the reports, the metamorphic transformations exhibited by the infected species tend to be much more dramatic than that. For instance, they undergo a dramatic change in size. Leeches, lice, and beetles, for example, are transformed into about the size of a Dalmatian. However,” he continued, “based on the trail this creature left behind, the damage left in its wake suggests it’s much larger than that. Much larger indeed. Based on its current trajectory, I believe it’s headed in the direction of Paris. Furthermore, if, like ordinary zombies, this overgrown insect is able to pass on the virus to humans, if it is allowed to cross the English Channel and reach Paris, the results could be devastating. It is imperative that we do not allow that to happen.”
“Good god,” Henri-Charles exclaimed, his voice a rich baritone, “one little bug? All that damage?”
Dr. Sound nodded. “Not such a little bug any more though,” he explained. “The Resurrectionists called these metamorphic insects BEASTS. That is, Beings with Extremely Abnormal Supernatural Traits.”
“Supernatural traits?” Jonathan asked. He stared into the amber-colored liquor in his half-empty glass, which rattled under another spot of turbulence.
“Supernatural, yes. That is, traits that defy the very laws of nature. In this case, the word supernatural refers to their unnatural size.”
“So,” said Henri-Charles, almost as if he were saying it to himself, “Our mission is to exterminate this overgrown BEAST before it arrives in France and turns Paris into another graveyard.”
“Just so,” Dr. Sound confirmed.
Henri-Charles and Jonathan exchanged another look. Jonathan gave him a nod.
“At least this confirms one thing,” Jonathan said, watching the professor for a reaction. “It proves the Resurrectionists are still at work.”
The scientist’s eyebrows furrowed, and his mustache seemed to twitch. “This hardly proves that,” he snapped.
“You said yourself that insects don’t contract the virus under ordinary circumstances and that, to the best of your knowledge, no one else had been able to replicate the conditions for insects to become infected. If the Resurrectionists did not deliberately infect this insect, how did it contract the zombie virus?” Jonathan said, his words beginning to slur. He took another swig of his drink and gestured to the barkeep for another.
“That was merely a hypothesis,” the scientist rebutted.
“Be that as it may,” said Jonathan, “my biggest concern at the moment is whether or not this dirigible will be enough to stop this beast.”
“It’ll have to be, Mr. Grimmer,” said Henri-Charles.
A sharp whistle interrupted their conversation. It was followed by the pilot’s voice through the speaking tube. “The abomination has been sighted. Starboard side, headed straight for Gravesend.”
Jonathan turned to the window. He saw it as soon as he looked out. The beast. His jaw dropped. He could hardly believe his eyes. The reality was far worse than it had ever been in his imagination.
“What is it?” asked Henri-Charles.
“Come and see,” Jonathan said. He could barely manage more than a whisper.
“It’s armed,” Dr. Sound exclaimed. He’d donned his pince-nez and joined Jonathan at the window. His eyes were wide as he stared, horror-stricken, at what loomed outside.
The specimen in question, flying just ahead of the Penny Dreadful, was a behemoth. It was easily as big as the Penny Dreadful, but twice as terrifying. With enormous, whip-like antennae, and a thick exoskeleton that seemed to cover its entire body, Jonathan had the disturbing suspicion that this abomination had once been a beetle of some kind. It looked a bit like an overgrown cockroach with wings.
Now, in its metamorphosed state, the creature was barely recognizable as an insect at all. It was a monster. With long legs and huge wings which beat rapidly, carrying the unbelievable weight of the creature across the sky.
Still, the most unusual thing about the creature’s appearance was the machinery fused with its body. The insect served as a shell for a massive airship, which was housed in the creature’s enormous belly. The ship obviously relied on the gargantuan insect’s own ability to fly, but it also boasted a number of additional propellers, presumably to improve the ship’s capacity for speed. Its operators were visible through a thick pane of glass at the front of the insect-turned-ship. Jonathan imagined the men inside weren’t merely passengers, but actually steering the mammoth insect like a vehicle. Attached to the creature’s anterior limbs was a pair of mechanical contraptions that looked suspiciously like machine guns. Jonathan imagined they could control those as well.
He turned to Dr. Sound. “You still maintain that the Resurrectionists are no longer active?”</Text>
            <Comments>The scene drags a bit. As a reader jumping into the series, I do appreciate the wallop of backstory to help me get caught up, but can the backstory be interspersed with something else? Can these men have some other goal to contend with while Dr. Sound explains stuff? Because aside from the lecture, there isn't much else going on here. 

As a new reader, I didn't feel like the information was too much, and I was thankful to be brought up to speed, even if it was an info dump. If I was the developmental editor on this story, I'd recommend adding a contagonist to the scene--an irritant or other person who created tension. Someone who either irritates Sound or Grimmer, and who may even add an element of haste. Balancing the backstory with interpersonal conflict would help a lot, in my opinion.

Aside from all that, it's not bad. The science requires a healthy dose of suspension of disbelief, but probably not more than enough to tax the typical zombie fan. A half-insect airship is just darn cool, and props for coming up with something I've never seen, read, or thought of. In summary, I personally would like to see some more character development, let me see what Annabel sees, and add a little conflict to the final scene to keep it moving.

 Really smooth until the ‘This isn’t exactly our first rodeo’ comment.  Is Jonathan American?  I’m all set for English idiom and argot and –pow—an Americanism rears up.  It made me stop and question the character. 
no fly zone - Another term I wouldn’t expect in a steampunk story. 
-- Good monster! 
First, a bit of entomology (as far as I know).  These days, we are all familiar with flying cockroaches, but 100+ years ago, I’m not sure people in England would be.  Some new world and Asian roaches can fly or glide, but as far as I know, European roaches cannot fly.

I think some observers would recognize the insect, but be stupefied that it had wings and could fly.  I hadn’t heard of flying cockroaches until the 1980s when the Asian variety were first mentioned as being ‘imported’, and becoming established in the US.
 Okay, Bryce, first of all, let me say as an old adventure writer that this is the "write stuff."  Thrilling, mysterious, and draws the reader to seek out more.  That said, let's talk about sequels.
   What a sequel is not is the second book of a long story.  If it picks up five minutes after the last scene of the previous story, it is generally a book, most usually epic fantasy, that was just too long for a single binding.  If there are three, it becomes a trilogy, but it's just one long story.
   A sequel can happen months after the first book, or even years.  The story is generally not a continuation of the first one, but is related to it, most often by having the same characters taking care of some consequence brought about by their solution to the first problem.  Sometimes this is done to bring closure when their solution opened a new can of worms.  It can also be different people, sometimes offspring, sometimes unrelated, in the same recognizable world that has been changed, usually for the worse.  It can even be a flashback, for example, if I wrote a book about Captain Monroe's last operation as a Queen's Officer, the one that got him cashiered, and it ended as he had crawled out of the bottle and was looking at a broken down Kestrel, seeing her refurbished form in his mind's eye.  All legitimate sequels.
   In the sequel, you can refer back to previous events, but the story cannot hinge on the reader's intimate knowledge of them, because this might be the first book they see.  Those who read the previous book will have that little "I remember that!" thrill, but those who haven't won't be thrown out of the story by them; they might even be inspired to buy the previous book.  It's a fine tightrope.
   Finally, it's especially good that you're outlining, as you won't be committing to 25,000 words that you can't use because they exclude first time readers; the plan notes are much easier to fix.
   I hope you find this useful.  Contact me at any time to pick my brain.  As I write a series, I may have already dealt with what you're seeing for the first time.  No sense having to reinvent the wheel!

- Jack (Blimprider)

 All right, going back and reading more carefully;
   1. Pleased to say that you know instinctively what a sequel is supposed to be.  Not having read book 1, I am not struggling with the characters at all.  It's easy to pick up their personalities and relationships, and of course what I can't address is whether they are consistent with their actions in the first book.  That being the easy part, I am going to assume they work for first-book readers as well.
   2. There were some comments about terms used.  I don't know Jonathan's background, but if he is from the US, Canada, or possibly northern Mexico, rodeo is likely a part of his lexicon, and its use suggests something to me about the character.  If not, then "not our first fair...  our first carnival...  our first dance... or tea party," as someone else suggested.  No fly zone is a purely modern term, first used, to the best of my memory, in Iraq before Saddam's fall to describe the areas where his military aircraft weren't allowed to operate.  Perhaps something like "...another quarantined graveyard?"
   3. You speak of difficulty with the opening.  I'm not seeing it.  You start with balls-to-the-wall action, drawing the reader into a mysterious world of mutants created by a secret society with designs on... what?  What's not to like?  Well done, sir.  Carry on!

            <Notes> From what we can tell, it’s passed from one victim to another via bodily fluids: blood, saliva, and so forth. Once infected, the victim begins to die. But it is in death that the disease truly takes its toll. After death sets in, he wakes up. Of course, when he does, he’s hungry.

Precisely so,” said Dr. Sound. “Dogs, horses, cats, and even rats can all become zombies, as we’ve seen in the days since the catastrophe. </Notes>

            <Title>Scene 76</Title>
            <Synopsis>Jonathan regains consciousness and heads down into the Resurrectionist facility</Synopsis>
            <Text>Rung after rung, Jonathan descended the rope ladder with the memory of Palmer’s betrayal playing over and over again in his mind. He kept thinking of Miss Monday, who had gone down into the underground lair of the Resurrectionists with Palmer. She’d warned Jonathan that she didn’t trust him, and Jonathan had vouched for him.
Miss Monday is going to kill Anthony Tidkins, given half a chance. I intend to stop her, by any means necessary.
Jonathan wondered if it was already too late. He didn’t know how long he’d been unconscious. Hopefully it hadn’t been long. Suddenly he lost his footing. He found it again just as quickly, but he reminded himself to pay more attention to what he was doing.
He climbed down until he hung just a few feet above the ground. Then he let go. He landed hard on the grass, and tumbled to the ground. Shakily, he got to his feet. It felt good to be back on solid ground. He dusted himself off and crossed the lawn to the large angular building.
He walked through the front door like he owned the place; incidentally, he did own the place. Mrs. Thompson was noticeably absent from her desk. The lobby was deserted. He headed through the printing room. The workforce was down to a skeleton crew. They looked up as Jonathan entered the room.
“What are you all doing here?” he asked. “Go home. Take the rest of the day off. Take the week! I expect London will be evacuated shortly.”
The workers looked up in confusion. He supposed that many of them had known his father but probably didn’t know Jonathan. Perhaps they didn’t even realize he was their boss.
“My name is Jonathan Grimmer,” he said loudly. “I value your loyalty, and I appreciate your efforts to keep the company running throughout this situation. I’m sure you’re all apprised of the situation—after all, you’re printing it—but if you haven’t been out there, perhaps you don’t believe the stories. I assure you, they’re all true. Pack up your belongings, and clear out. If the city’s still standing in a week, you may return to your jobs. Until then, you are all dismissed, with pay. Consider it a holiday.”
They didn’t need to be told again. Whether or not they thought their new boss was insane or eccentric, or whether they believed him, Jonathan didn’t know. Nor did he care. He just didn’t want any collateral damage in the fight with the Resurrectionists. He didn’t need the blood on his hands.
As the workers cleared out, Jonathan headed down the hall to Palmer’s office. He wondered how Roderick had fared with finding the staircase in the library. Jonathan was supposed to have taken the tailor’s entrance, according to Annabel’s plan. No time for that now.
The elevator was the most obvious entrance, and it was also the loudest. No doubt the Resurrectionists would hear him coming. But it was also the quickest way down, and Jonathan wasn’t about to waste time looking through the tailor’s shop. He opened the door to Palmer’s office, grabbed the trick book that activated the elevator, and waited.
A gap opened up in the floor. The elevator rose through it. Jonathan stepped inside, flicked on the lights, and pulled the lever. The elevator clanked noisily, and began to head down into the dark.</Text>

            <Title>"Dear Jonathan Grimmer</Title>
            <Text>“My Dear Mr. Grimmer,” Jonathan began, reading the letter aloud for Annabel’s benefit. She had learned to read somewhat late in life, and she found it difficult to read Roderick’s flamboyant penmanship.
“As you are aware, I have taken up residence in Paris, where I maintain a humble studio for my artwork, and where I have been flourishing as an artist. Paris suits my temperament in ways that London, alas, never did. Much as I have settled into a life here in Paris, I fear that fate has necessitated an expedition into the heart of our former city, where it is rumored our masked friends continue to operate their laboratory. After a recent encounter with our mutual friend, I believe I can confirm that the rumors are true.”
“Mutual friend?” Annabel repeated. “Do you think he means Parson Sinews?”
Jonathan nodded, and returned to the letter. “Having tired of the hospitality at Chateau d’If, where the guards tend to speak freely under the misplaced belief that the prison is inescapable, he has presented me with some new information that should lead us to discover the whereabouts of some of our missing friends. Furthermore, he is of the belief that we will find Dr. Karnstein, our mutual friend’s former fiancé there, along with a close relation of yours.”
“Your mother,” Annabel said.
“I can only assume that’s who he means,” Jonathan replied. He returned his eyes to the page and continued. “I intend to join our mutual friend on this little outing, to find our way beyond the London Wall and into the Lazaretto. I do not ask this lightly, but I must ask it all the same. Will you do us the favor of making one of our number? Our mutual friend wishes me to mention that we will take every measure to ensure the safety of the crew, and has taken it upon himself to provide the necessary equipment; however, your vessel would make an excellent addition to our assets, provided you accept our invitation.”
“How long till the Dreadful is operational again?” Annabel asked.
“It should be ready by tomorrow, according to Mr. Lockwood,” Jonathan answered. Again he returned his eyes to the page in front of him. The more he read, the more afraid he was of finishing the letter. What Roderick was asking wasn’t just risky. It was suicide.
“It is incumbent upon me to ask one additional favor. If our other mutual friend is with you, please extend the invitation to include her. If you are agreeable to my proposal, please meet me in Paris at the address below.”
Annabel gazed out at the meandering water before them. Already, the town of survivors had begun to restore the pier. A monument had been hastily erected near the Three Daws Public House, with the names of the dead etched in stone. Annabel didn’t know if they’d ever get any answers as to why the Resurrectionists had attacked Gravesend—for all she knew, they really were just testing their new weapon—but she knew that whatever answers she might find, she would find them in London.
She closed her mechanical fingers around the hilt of Kasumi’s blade and tested it as she’d watched Kasumi do a hundred times before, slicing it through the air and listening to the blade sing.
“Wish I’d gotten her to teach me. Always thought there would be more time,” she said. She sheathed the sword. “Guess I’ll have to figure it out on my own. Kas always made it look easy.”
“That she did,” Jonathan agreed.
“So, are we really doing this?”
Jonathan didn’t hesitate. He folded the letter and tucked it into his pocket. “I’m in, if you are,” he said. Annabel followed his eyes to the names on the monument. One name stood out, among all the others, and she knew it was the name Jonathan was looking at. Kasumi Hattori.
She could have laughed. “Of all the places I could be going, I never thought I’d end up back in London.”</Text>

Etymology[edit]
The word "automaton" is the latinization of the Greek αὐτόματον, automaton, (neuter) "acting of one’s own will". It is more often used to describe non-electronic moving machines, especially those that have been made to resemble human or animal actions, such as the jacks on old public striking clocks, or the cuckoo and any other animated figures on a cuckoo clock.
Ancient automata[edit]
The automata in the Hellenistic world were intended as toys, religious idols, or tools for demonstrating basic scientific principles, including those built by Greek mathematician Hero of Alexandria (sometimes known as Heron). When his writings on hydraulics, pneumatics, and mechanics were translated into Latin in the 16th century, Hero’s readers initiated reconstruction of his machines, which included siphons, a fire engine, a water organ, the aeolipile, and a programmable cart.[2][3]

The Antikythera mechanism from 150–100 BC was designed to calculate the positions of astronomical objects.
Complex mechanical devices are known to have existed in ancient Greece, though the only surviving example is the Antikythera mechanism. It is thought to have come originally from Rhodes, where there was apparently a tradition of mechanical engineering; the island was renowned for its automata; to quote Pindar's seventh Olympic Ode:
The animated figures stand
Adorning every public street
And seem to breathe in stone, or
move their marble feet.
However, the information gleaned from recent scans of the fragments indicate that it may have come from the colonies of Corinth in Sicily and implies a connection with Archimedes.
There are also examples from myth: Daedalus used quicksilver to install a voice in his statues. Hephaestus created automata for his workshop: Talos, an artificial man of bronze, and, according to Hesiod, the woman Pandora.
According to Jewish legend, Solomon used his wisdom to design a throne with mechanical animals which hailed him as king when he ascended it; upon sitting down an eagle would place a crown upon his head, and a dove would bring him a Torah scroll. It's also said that when King Solomon stepped upon the throne, a mechanism was set in motion. As soon as he stepped upon the first step, a golden ox and a golden lion each stretched out one foot to support him and help him rise to the next step. On each side, the animals helped the King up until he was comfortably seated upon the throne.[4]
In ancient China, a curious account of automata is found in the Lie Zi text, written in the 3rd century BC. Within it there is a description of a much earlier encounter between King Mu of Zhou (1023-957 BC) and a mechanical engineer known as Yan Shi, an 'artificer'. The latter proudly presented the king with a life-size, human-shaped figure of his mechanical handiwork (Wade-Giles spelling):
The king stared at the figure in astonishment. It walked with rapid strides, moving its head up and down, so that anyone would have taken it for a live human being. The artificer touched its chin, and it began singing, perfectly in tune. He touched its hand, and it began posturing, keeping perfect time...As the performance was drawing to an end, the robot winked its eye and made advances to the ladies in attendance, whereupon the king became incensed and would have had Yen Shih [Yan Shi] executed on the spot had not the latter, in mortal fear, instantly taken the robot to pieces to let him see what it really was. And, indeed, it turned out to be only a construction of leather, wood, glue and lacquer, variously coloured white, black, red and blue. Examining it closely, the king found all the internal organs complete—liver, gall, heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys, stomach and intestines; and over these again, muscles, bones and limbs with their joints, skin, teeth and hair, all of them artificial...The king tried the effect of taking away the heart, and found that the mouth could no longer speak; he took away the liver and the eyes could no longer see; he took away the kidneys and the legs lost their power of locomotion. The king was delighted.[5]
Other notable examples of automata include Archytas's dove, mentioned by Aulus Gellius.[6] Similar Chinese accounts of flying automata are written of the 5th century BC Mohist philosopher Mozi and his contemporary Lu Ban, who made artificial wooden birds (ma yuan) that could successfully fly according to the Han Fei Zi and other texts.[7]

In the mid-8th century, the first wind powered automata were built: "statues that turned with the wind over the domes of the four gates and the palace complex of the Round City of Baghdad". The "public spectacle of wind-powered statues had its private counterpart in the 'Abbasid palaces where automata of various types were predominantly displayed."[8] Also in the 8th century, the Muslim alchemist, Jābir ibn Hayyān (Geber), included recipes for constructing artificial snakes, scorpions, and humans which would be subject to their creator's control in his coded Book of Stones. In 827, Caliph Al-Ma'mun had a silver and golden tree in his palace in Baghdad, which had the features of an automatic machine. There were metal birds that sang automatically on the swinging branches of this tree built by Muslim inventors and engineers at the time.[9][page needed] The Abbasid Caliph Al-Muqtadir also had a golden tree in his palace in Baghdad in 915, with birds on it flapping their wings and singing.[10] In the 9th century, the Banū Mūsā brothers invented a programmable automatic flute player and which they described in their Book of Ingenious Devices.[11]

Al-Jazari described complex programmable humanoid automata amongst other machines he designed and constructed in the “Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices” in 1206.[citation needed] His automaton was a boat with four automatic musicians that floated on a lake to entertain guests at royal drinking parties. His mechanism had a programmable drum machine with pegs (cams) that bump into little levers that operate the percussion. The drummer could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns if the pegs were moved around.[12] According to Charles B. Fowler, the automata were a "robot band" which performed "more than fifty facial and body actions during each musical selection."[13]
Al-Jazari also constructed a hand washing automaton first employing the flush mechanism now used in modern flush toilets. It features a female automaton standing by a basin filled with water. When the user pulls the lever, the water drains and the female automaton refills the basin.[14] His "peacock fountain" was another more sophisticated hand washing device featuring humanoid automata as servants which offer soap and towels. Mark E. Rosheim describes it as follows: "Pulling a plug on the peacock's tail releases water out of the beak; as the dirty water from the basin fills the hollow base a float rises and actuates a linkage which makes a servant figure appear from behind a door under the peacock and offer soap. When more water is used, a second float at a higher level trips and causes the appearance of a second servant figure — with a towel!"[15] Al-Jazari thus appears to have been the first inventor to display an interest in creating human-like machines for practical purposes such as manipulating the environment for human comfort.[16]
Villard de Honnecourt, in his 1230s sketchbook, show plans for animal automata and an angel that perpetually turns to face the sun. At the end of the thirteenth century, Robert II, Count of Artois built a pleasure garden at his castle at Hesdin that incorporated several automata as entertainment in the walled park. The work was conducted by local workmen and overseen by the Italian knight Renaud Coignet. It included monkey marionettes, a sundial supported by lions and "wild men", mechanized birds, mechanized fountains and a bellows-operated organ. The park was famed for its automata well into the fifteenth century before it was destroyed by English soldiers in the sixteenth century.[17][18][19]
The Chinese author Xiao Xun wrote that when the Ming Dynasty founder Hongwu (r. 1368–1398) was destroying the palaces of Khanbaliq belonging to the previous Yuan Dynasty, there were—amongst many other mechanical devices—automatons found that were in the shape of tigers.[20]
Renaissance and Early Modern automata[edit]

A Cuckoo clock with a built in automaton of a Cuckoo that flaps its wings and opens its beak in time to the sounds of the cuckoo call to mark the number of hours on the analogue dial.
The Renaissance witnessed a considerable revival of interest in automata. Hero's treatises were edited and translated into Latin and Italian. Giovanni Fontana created mechanical devils and rocket-propelled animal automata. Numerous clockwork automata were manufactured in the 16th century, principally by the goldsmiths of the Free Imperial Cities of central Europe. These wondrous devices found a home in the cabinet of curiosities or Wunderkammern of the princely courts of Europe. Hydraulic and pneumatic automata, similar to those described by Hero, were created for garden grottoes.
Leonardo da Vinci sketched a more complex automaton around the year 1495. The design of Leonardo's robot was not rediscovered until the 1950s. The robot could, if built successfully, move its arms, twist its head, and sit up.
The Smithsonian Institution has in its collection a clockwork monk, about 15 in (380 mm) high, possibly dating as early as 1560. The monk is driven by a key-wound spring and walks the path of a square, striking his chest with his right arm, while raising and lowering a small wooden cross and rosary in his left hand, turning and nodding his head, rolling his eyes, and mouthing silent obsequies. From time to time, he brings the cross to his lips and kisses it. It is believed that the monk was manufactured by Juanelo Turriano, mechanician to the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V.[21]
A new attitude towards automata is to be found in Descartes when he suggested that the bodies of animals are nothing more than complex machines - the bones, muscles and organs could be replaced with cogs, pistons and cams. Thus mechanism became the standard to which Nature and the organism was compared. France in the 17th century was the birthplace of those ingenious mechanical toys that were to become prototypes for the engines of the Industrial Revolution. Thus, in 1649, when Louis XIV was still a child, an artisan named Camus designed for him a miniature coach, and horses complete with footmen, page and a lady within the coach; all these figures exhibited a perfect movement. According to P. Labat, General de Gennes constructed, in 1688, in addition to machines for gunnery and navigation, a peacock that walked and ate. Athanasius Kircher produced many automatons to create Jesuit shows, including a statue which spoke and listened via a speaking tube.

Tea-serving Japanese automaton, "karakuri ningyō", with mechanism (right), 19th century
The world's first successfully-built biomechanical automaton is considered to be The Flute Player, invented by the French engineer Jacques de Vaucanson in 1737. He also constructed the Digesting Duck, a mechanical duck that gave the false illusion of eating and defecating, seeming to endorse Cartesian ideas that animals are no more than machines of flesh.
In 1769, a chess-playing machine called the Turk, created by Wolfgang von Kempelen, made the rounds of the courts of Europe purporting to be an automaton. The Turk was operated from inside by a hidden human director, and was not a true automaton.
Other 18th century automaton makers include the prolific Frenchman Pierre Jaquet-Droz (see Jaquet-Droz automata) and his contemporary Henri Maillardet. Maillardet, a Swiss mechanic, created an automaton capable of drawing four pictures and writing three poems. Maillardet's Automaton is now part of the collections at the Franklin Institute Science Museum in Philadelphia. Belgian-born John Joseph Merlin created the mechanism of the Silver Swan automaton, now at Bowes Museum.[22] Tipu's Tiger is a late-18th century example of automata, made for Tipu Sultan, featuring a European soldier being mauled by a tiger.
According to philosopher Michel Foucault, Frederick the Great, king of Prussia from 1740 to 1786, was "obsessed" with automata.[23] According to Manuel de Landa, "he put together his armies as a well-oiled clockwork mechanism whose components were robot-like warriors".
Japan adopted automata during the Edo period (1603–1867); they were known as karakuri ningyō.
Automata, particularly watches and clocks, were popular in China during the 18th and 19th centuries, and items were produced for the Chinese market. Strong interest by Chinese collectors in the 21st century brought many interesting items to market where they have had dramatic realizations.[24]
Modern automata[edit]
The famous magician Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin (1805–1871) was known for creating automata for his stage shows.
The period 1860 to 1910 is known as "The Golden Age of Automata". During this period many small family based companies of Automata makers thrived in Paris. From their workshops they exported thousands of clockwork automata and mechanical singing birds around the world. It is these French automata that are collected today, although now rare and expensive they attract collectors worldwide. The main French makers were Vichy, Roullet &amp; Decamps, Lambert, Phalibois, Renou and Bontems.
Contemporary automata continue this tradition with an emphasis on art, rather than technological sophistication. Contemporary automata are represented by the works of Cabaret Mechanical Theatre in the United Kingdom, Dug North and Chomick+Meder,[25] Thomas Kuntz,[26] Arthur Ganson, Joe Jones in the United States, and Le Défenseur du Temps by French artist Jacques Monestier.
Some mechanized toys developed during the 18th and 19th centuries were automata made with paper. Despite the relative simplicity of the material, paper automata require a high degree of technical ingenuity.
In education[edit]
The potential educational value of mechanical toys in teaching transversal skills has been recognised by the European Union education project Clockwork objects, enhanced learning: Automata Toys Construction (CLOHE).[27]
In film[edit]
In the 2011 film "Hugo", the title character, Hugo Cabret, must fix a "mechanical man" automaton, which he and his father tried to fix, believing it holds a secret message from the latter before his untimely death. Near the end of the film, it is revealed that the very same automaton was created by the character of George Méliès, which he later donated to the museum where Hugo's father worked, after he could not fix it himself. The film is based on the 2007 book "The Invention of Hugo Cabret" by American author Brian Selznick.[28]

            <Title>Scene Three</Title>
            <Text>Jonathan hastened to keep pace with his friends, who had slipped between a pair of tall trees and slid down the muddy slope that led down to the river. His mother had warned him not to stray too far from the house, but Jonathan had never felt particularly inclined to listen to her, especially when doing so might interfere with an adventure.
It was raining, as it often was, so the slope was slick, but Jonathan could hear his friends’ voices ahead of him. He pushed off at the top of the hill and let his momentum carry him down. He took off running when he reached the bottom, though the ground was just as slick there as it had been along the slope, and more than once he nearly lost his balance and tumbled into the mud. His mother would be furious. His clothes were ruined.
The dots in the distance quickly resolved into the familiar shapes of his friends. Harry, the son of a butcher, who had earned a reputation for being somewhat of a bully and a tyrant. And James, whose father’s gruesome murder a few years after James’ birth had been the talk of the town for years, and who himself had become quite the clever pickpocket. Whether it was because of his father’s murder or some other cause, James hardly ever spoke a word, though Jonathan would often catch him in fits of laughter.
He had been warned to stay away from this pair. His mother called them common. She used other names to describe them too, some of them less kind: urchins, vandals, ruffians, scoundrels. Whatever she called them, it only made Jonathan want to spend more time with them. He knew how it drove her mad. Jonathan was supposed to be upper class, but he found other upper class children tiresome.
At low tide the mud that lined the Thames was often tinted red by countless worms, which lived in the river. Harry, with a laugh, had bent down to scoop up a few handfuls of the reddened mud, unearthing dozens of these so-called blood worms, aptly named due to their reddish colour. Harry’s hands were coated in mud, some of which had slopped onto his trousers, not that anyone would notice the additional dirt. Harry lived in a constant state of filth. The blood worms wriggled in his hands.
“Disgusting,” said Jonathan. “What are they?”
“Noodles,” said Harry. With a laugh, he mimed eating them. Mud dripped from his hands, and some of the worms wriggled free and fell to the ground.
Jonathan’s stomach churned.
“I dare you to eat one,” said James, suddenly.
Jonathan and Harry both stared at him in silence. Harry recovered first. “Let John do it,” he said, holding out his hands to Jonathan.
James shrugged and looked at Jonathan.
His expression must have been one of horror, but they were staring at him expectantly. Jonathan never turned away from a dare. His mother would wring his neck, of course, but he wasn’t about to back down. He didn’t wish to get any more dirt on his trousers though, so he was careful as he leaned forward and looked at the blood worms in Harry’s outstretched hands. He picked out the smallest one.
“Alright,” he said, forcing a smile.
He lifted the worm above his head and opened his mouth. His stomach made a noise. James began giggling, while Henry started clucking like a chicken.
The worm dangled above his head, and Jonathan looked at him, annoyed. Mud dripped onto his cheek, and he wiped it away with the back of his hand.
“I’ll do it,” he said defiantly. He raised the worm above his mouth again, tilted his head back, and opened wide. “Down the hatch,” he said, and let the worm fall into his mouth.
He could feel it wriggling. It tasted like dirt. He felt sick, but he forced himself to try to swallow. It caught in his throat.
Choking, he tried to cough the thing back up, but it was stuck somehow, balled up in his throat. His hands went to his throat, and he tried to force it back up.
His breath came out in wet gurgles. His lungs began to ache, and his eyes went wide. He’d never felt so frightened. He was going to die, he was sure of it. This was how his life would end, with a foolish dare.
His friends were turning into hazy blotches of light. Dizzily, he reached out his hands, but they moved away from him. He blacked out.</Text>
            <Comments>I feel like this is choppy and combined 4 sentences into 2. Maybe divide them up by description and then action?
Using And in the beginning of a sentence is tough! It works until the second part of the second where you put, 'and who himself.' I would divide up into two sentences as well.
Were these fits of laughter something that happened out of nowhere or were they triggered from jokes between friends? What did Jonathan think of this?
The comment about the red worms being called blood worms should be mentioned first, perhaps? It felt like an afterthought to me.
How long was the silence? A few seconds? A few agonizing minutes?</Comments>

            <Title>Scene Two</Title>
            <Synopsis>Annabel and Jonathan explore the Grimmer &amp; Sons underground, believing they have discovered the Resurrectionists’ headquarters and believing that Mrs. Grimmer is one of the Resurrectionists. There they discover the Zed in the tank of water.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The office in which they arrived was nearly identical to the one upstairs. Annabel had lost track of how many stories they’d descended to get here, but her ears had popped uncomfortably once or twice, so it must have been quite a few. She pulled away from his kiss as they landed in the basement.
“I’m sorry,” she said. “I can’t…”
“It’s fine,” Mr. O tried to say, but Annabel was hardly listening.
“No, really, I’m sorry,” she said, flustered by her own impulsiveness. “How improper,” she said.
Having grown up in the lower classes, Annabel had learned much of what she knew about upper and middle class manners from books. Much in the way that a foreigner can often be said to have a better vocabulary than a native speaker of a language, while still struggling with pronunciation, Annabel had a deep understanding of the rules of polite society. It was the execution of those niceties that she struggled with.
“I honestly don’t know what came over me. Really, I don’t even like you.”
“Oh, that’s reassuring,” Mr. O said angrily, though he was blushing from cheek to ear. “Anyway, it was my fault entirely. Forget it ever happened.”
“I will then,” she snapped.
Finally, he released the latch of the elevator’s gate, and allowed Annabel to exit first. With undisguised relief, she exited the claustrophobic space, and entered the other office, her hand hovering near her gun holster, which was concealed beneath a few layers of her bustle skirt.
This office had curtains over the windows, like the one upstairs, though she suspected that if she were to pull them aside, she’d be looking at a bare wall. Still, they provided the comforting illusion that they were not several stories underground. The desk in this office was clearly used regularly. It was covered in scratches, tea stains, and loosely organised sheets of dog-eared and crumpled papers. Annabel skimmed through some of the documents at the top of the pile as she perused the office.
She looked to Mr. O, who seemed even more out of his element than she was. Understandable, if what he was saying was true. Still…
“I imagine you don’t trust me any more than I trust you, which is to say, not at all. However,” she said, pausing. “This situation merits caution. We may very well be in the secret headquarters of the Resurrectionists.”
Mr. O, for his part, headed to the door and looked through the glass. When he saw that there was no immediate threat outside the door, he turned to face her.
“You’re right. I don’t trust you. But right now, there are very few people that I do trust. There’s still much that I don’t know—that we don’t know—but there is a connection between the Resurrectionists and my family.” He paused, clearly hesitating with something. “My father wrote me a letter, just before he died, warning me about Lord Connor. He knew something about the Resurrectionists.”
Annabel nodded, sympathetic. No wonder his interest in meeting Lord Connor.
“My mother must have known something too. I overheard her talking with someone, saying something about Lord Connor.”
“Your mother?” Annabel replied. “So you think she’s connected to the Resurrectionists too?”
“Shhh. Someone’s coming,” he said.
Annabel scanned the room for somewhere to hide.
“Here,” she said, opening the door to a supply closet.
She slipped inside, and Mr. O followed, sliding the door closed and shutting them into near darkness. Once again she was pressed up close to Mr. O in close quarters.
The door to the office swung open, and Annabel could hear two voices, deep in conversation. She held her breath and listened to the voices and footsteps grow closer as they crossed the room.
“Jonathan?” said one voice, and Annabel felt Mr. O clench his muscles. If she could see him in the darkness, she guessed his face might have gone pale. “You must be mistaken. He doesn’t know anything.”
“I have it on good authority that he was there. He escaped via airship, but he was in the room with Lord Connor,” said the second voice. An American accent, a man, probably in his thirties or forties, Annabel guessed.
“Circumstantial,” the first voice replied. A woman, older from the sound of her voice. “That doesn’t mean anything.”
“In either case, I think we should bring him in.”
“I’m not sure he’s ready. To be honest, I’m not sure he’ll ever be ready.”
“You’re his mother. You want to protect him. That’s understandable,” said the American. “But the work we’re doing here is important. He could be important, especially if the Resurrectionists want him.”
Annabel heard the elevator gate swing open, drowning out the woman’s reply. She heard footsteps on metal, then the sound of the gate closing.
“We’re not using Jonathan as bait,” the woman was saying, a tone of finality to her voice. “What about the woman? The thief? We need to move the plan forward, without Jonathan.”
“Miss Monday?” the American replied. “She’s proven to be somewhat elusive.”
The elevator had begun to ascend, taking the older woman and the American back to the ground floor. Their voices became indistinguishable as the elevator disappeared, but they both caught one more thing. A name. Dr. Allen.
Annabel waited until the sound of the elevator became a distant thrum, before stepping out of the closet. At last, she remembered to breathe. As she’d suspected, Mr. O was looking a bit pale. She looked at him for an explanation.
“Jonathan?” she asked.
“At your service,” Mr. O replied. “Jonathan Grimmer.”
“Ah,” she said. “So you’re heir to the Grimmer Company.”
Obviously she’d known from the name emblazoned on his airship that he was connected to the Grimmers, but she hadn’t known for sure that he was one of them. He might have just been an employee of the Grimmer Company.
“So that woman, that was Mrs. Grimmer? Your mother?”
Mr. O—Jonathan Grimmer—nodded, stress clearly written on his face. It was difficult to think of him as Mr. Grimmer.
“Bloody hell,” Annabel swore. “So I guess she is connected to the Society.”
“Actually, that’s why I asked about the newspaper. The Weekly Gazette is one of Grimmer and Sons’ newspapers,” Mr. O told her. “My mother said something earlier about wanting to print the true story, but she was concerned it would blow her cover.”
“Her cover? You mean—”
“She might not be with the Resurrectionists at all. I think she might be working against them, from the inside.”
“It’s possible,” Annabel agreed, heading to the door. “Then again, she might not. Shouldn’t we see for ourselves?”
She peered through the pane of glass in the door. The coast appeared to be clear, but she cracked open the door and was careful as she leaned out for a second look. She gestured to Mr. O that it was clear, and a moment later, they were heading down the hall.
The hall was brightly lit by lamps in sconces along the wall, and there were no alcoves and no supply closets for them to duck into if they were caught down here. There was a series of doors along the hallway, labeled, like the office doors upstairs, with nameplates.
Abraham Palmer, Agent, said the first nameplate. Bartholemew White, Chemist, said the next. Rémy Mills, Biologist. Mrs. Elizabeth Grimmer, Chief Financial Officer.
“My mother,” said Mr. O when they reached that door. He tried the door, but it was locked, like the others.
“What of Mr. Grimmer?” Annabel asked casually.
A flicker of emotion passed through Mr. O’s face. His lips tightened.
“I’m sorry,” she said, realising that whatever had happened to Mr. O’s father, it must have been in recent memory.
Mr. O nodded, quietly.
They passed another door. Dr. Robert Miles, Engineer. Mr. O seemed to hesitate here, and his jaw tightened but he said nothing. The door was locked, like the others.
The next door they came to was not labelled with the name of any person, but was simply called Alpha Laboratory. Mr. O paused here. He tried the door, and it swung open, much to Annabel’s surprise. 
She waited at the doorway while Mr. O went inside and checked that the room was empty. He nodded, and Annabel entered the room, closing the door behind her while Mr. O worked at lighting the room’s lamps. Even before he’d finished his task, she’d caught a glimpse of an image that would undoubtedly haunt her dreams that night and for nights to come.
She choked back a cry of horror as she stared at an enormous, cylindrical fish tank of thick glass, which stood on one side of the room, the contents of the tank becoming more clear as each new lamp cast light upon the room.
“Oh dearest God in heaven,” she said quietly, “What in the name of Fuck is that?”</Text>
            <Comments>Obviously she must like him a little, even if she doesn’t realize it.  I like the exchange here, but I suggest going back in the book to make the attraction more obvious to the reader.
After the kiss they shared, maybe indicate here if she is thinking on that, or about how close they are.  Just for a moment, as her attention would then go to the person entering the office.
How can she feel his muscles?  Are their bodies pressed against each other?  Is her hand resting on his shoulder, arm, or chest?
This part is in Annabel’s perspective, but you have been jumping between addressing Jonathan between his actual name and the alias he provided.  Suggestion, continue to use Mr. O up until this point, where Jonathan confirms his identity.</Comments>
            <Notes>removed:  We need to move the plan forward, but the antiserum is still unstable, and Dr. Allen’s health is deteriorating. We may not have long.

removed:  We believe she must have been hit with Lazarus, but we need to find her…

“We don’t know that!” Mr. O protested.
“Oh? So who is this Dr. Allen she mentioned?” Annabel asked, trying to be gentle while still being blunt. It wasn’t in her nature to be gentle. “Name rings a bell. Isn’t he that lunatic boffin that cuts people into pieces and turns them into puppets?”
She was thinking about Bertram Melbourne. And she knew perfectly well who Dr. Allen was.
Mr. O grimaced.
“Automatons,” he corrected.
“Sorry?”
“He turns them into automatons,” he said.
Annabel gave him a look.
“I did a bit of research last night, after you abandoned me at Connor’s party,” he explained.
“And? What did you learn?”
“Dr. Allen…” he began. “I believe we now have a suspect.”
“A suspect?” Annabel replied. “You make it sound as though we’re detectives.”
“If I wish to catch my father’s killer, and if you wish to determine who it was that set you up, then we must act as detectives, don’t you think?”</Notes>

            <Text>One look at the long stretch of the Thames at the broken pier, and it was clear that the town of Gravesend would never be the same. Even weeks after the devastating attack on the village, and there were still bloodstains on every street. They were still rebuilding homes and clearing out the rubble the beast had left behind.
Some of the airship’s own crew were among the many slain during the battle, but Kasumi was not among them. Not yet, anyway. Annabel was seated at her bedside. The girl was still unconscious. Her sword leaned against the wall of her bedroom. Annabel had arranged to let more rooms from Mrs. Miller. The town hailed the crew of the Penny Dreadful as heroes, but Annabel didn’t feel it.
“It’s my fault,” she said. “I should have done it myself. What was I thinking, trusting a girl to do a woman’s job?”
“A girl? She’s older than she looks, you know. Anyway, this is the Resurrectionists’ fault,” Jonathan said, with feeling.
His hands tightened into fists whenever he spoke of them. The rogue scientists had taken everything from them—their city, their livelihood, their friends, Jonathan’s mother. Even outside of London, their lives were haunted by the Resurrectionists. Annabel’s prosthetic arm and eye were a constant reminder of her encounters with them.
“Do you think she’ll ever wake up?” she asked.
“The doctors seem to think so,” Jonathan offered.
Annabel said nothing. She’d heard what the doctors had said herself. She wanted to hear what Jonathan thought. That he was falling back on the words of doctors meant he was no more hopeful than she was. She stood and headed to the doorway.
“I need some air. Someone should stay with her in case she wakes,” she said, heading outside.
She shut the door, leaned against it, and sank to the floor. She hugged her knees and began to cry. She wasn’t just crying for Kasumi. Some of the men who worked the docks had become friends of hers over the past few weeks. She’d shared drinks at the Three Daws with several of them. She’d met members of the Penny Dreadful crew who’d died in the battle. She clenched her fist and slammed it against the wall. Brick crumbled around her fist, and she swore. She hadn’t meant to do that.
She stood when she heard Mrs. Miller come running, and quickly dried her eyes. She sniffed. Her cheeks turned red as the landlady took in the scene.
“Everything all right, girl?”
Annabel nodded. “I’m sorry,” she said. “Sometimes I forget my own strength. I’ll pay for the damage.”
“You already have, dearie,” Mrs. Miller replied, patting the diamond necklace she was wearing.
Annabel smiled. She was glad her gift was going to good use. Better Mrs. Miller have it than those rich toffs at the docks. She winced, suddenly feeling a pang of guilt. Those rich toffs were probably dead now.
“This just came in the mail,” said her landlady, showing her an envelope. “It’s addressed to your friend, Mr. Grimmer. Is he in there?”
Annabel nodded. “I’m surprised the mail’s still coming with everything that’s going on.”
“Well, I’m just scratchin’ me ‘ead tryin’ to figure out ‘ow anyone knew Mr. Grimmer was at Gravesend.”
“Fair point,” Annabel replied, taking the letter. “I’ll see that Mr. Grimmer gets this. Thank you, Mrs. Miller.”
“Let me know if you need anythin’ else, love.”
Annabel managed a smile and thanked Mrs. Miller again. Then she looked at the crisp blue envelope, sealed with wax, and addressed with neat, elegant penmanship. It was addressed to “Jonathan Grimmer at Gravesend.” The return address was a Parisian residence that Annabel recognized. It was Roderick Steen’s address.
She opened the door to Kasumi’s room and stepped inside, holding the envelope up to show Jonathan. Her heart froze the moment she entered the room. All the warmth had gone out of the bedroom. Kasumi lay completely still. Even the gentle rise and fall of her chest had stopped. Jonathan wasn’t looking at Kasumi, but his eyes fixed on Annabel and began to water at the sight of her. The envelope dropped to the floor.
“I only left for a minute,” Annabel said, her voice starting to break.
“I know,” was all Jonathan said in reply. He got to his feet and put his arms around her, and then the tears came, unbidden, from her one good eye. Her other eye clicked and whirred uncertainly as her body heaved with painful sobs. She let Jonathan hold her. She didn’t care if crying made her ugly, or weak. Kasumi had fought beside her. As far as Annabel was concerned, that made her more than a friend. She was a sister.
“She was so brave,” she said.
“She was,” Jonathan agreed. There was sadness in his voice too, and Annabel was comforted to know that he felt as she did.
She removed herself from the embrace and tried to pull herself together. She looked down at Kasumi, just in time to see the girl’s eyelids flick open.
“Did you see that?” she whispered to Jonathan.
“See what?”
Suddenly, Kasumi sat up, and Jonathan staggered back in alarm. For one heartbreaking second, Annabel thought that Kas was still alive. She wasn’t. She was moving again, but she wasn’t alive.
“The sword!” Annabel shouted as Kas crawled out of bed and lunged toward her. “I’ll hold her off.”
Annabel wasn’t in any real danger. She’d been bitten by zombies before and lived to tell the tale. As far as she knew, she was immune to infection. It was likely that so was Jonathan. That didn’t make this any less horrifying though. One way or another, they needed to put Kas down for good.
She danced around Kas as the dead girl lunged after her, clumsy and stiff. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Jonathan retrieve the sword.
“Leave,” he told her. “There’s no need for you to see this.”
“No, Jonathan. Give me the sword. I’ll do it.”
“Go,” Jonathan insisted.
Annabel relented. As Kas continued to chase her, she headed to the door. Then Jonathan shouted to get Kas’s attention, and she turned, snarling and slobbering like a feral animal. Annabel took one last look at her. There was no trace of the Kasumi Hattori she’d known. She was a mere husk, a shell for the virus to control, an unthinking cadaver. She wouldn’t have wanted to live like that.
Annabel slipped out of the room, grateful that Jonathan was here.</Text>

            <Title>Scene Five</Title>
            <Text>“Jonathan had the first known case of the Lazarus Virus. An early strain. Under the careful ministrations of Dr. Allen, he recovered from his illness. He had been feverish, and had practically no recollection of the incident upon recovering. But that was not the end of things. A servant had been bitten. She took to the fever, and was sent home to recover. Of course, she didn’t recover; she got worse. The virus spreads easily. A bite. A scratch. Jonathan’s father began trying to track down incidences of attacks involving the infected, hunting down the zombies, throwing their bodies into the Thames, and covering up their deaths. Eventually, a more sophisticated means of dealing with the virus became necessary. The virus was impossible to contain. Meanwhile, Dr. Allen had begun studying the virus, hoping to find a cure. Apparently his obsession was passed on to his assistant.”
Annabel raised her eyes. The story certainly explained a lot. Why Jack was so bent on finding a cure. Why Mr. O’s father had founded the Hunting Society. Why the Resurrectionists suspected Mr. O might be immune to the virus. They believed that those who’d been exposed to earlier strains of the virus and survived the ordeal might be the key to immunity. Like Mr. O. Like her.
“So that’s why the Resurrectionists wanted to infect me with Lazarus,” he said. “I’d already been exposed.”
“Yes,” said Mrs. Grimmer.
“But what about her?” he said, looking at Annabel.
Annabel smiled awkwardly. “Yes, about that…”
“Lord Connor was not your first encounter with zombies,” he said.
“No,” she admitted. When she noticed that the entire room was looking at her, waiting for an explanation, she let out a little sigh. “It’s a long story. I believe Mrs. Grimmer mentioned that time was a bit of an issue; perhaps we can continue this discussion some other time. Perhaps after we’ve stopped the Dead London experiment?”
Mr. O bailed her out.
“That sounds reasonable,” he said, then turned to his mother. “So, what is this plan of yours?”
She told them.
Annabel took a sip of her tea, blinked her one eye, and set her teacup back down upon the table. She let her chin rest upon a gloved hand. “Well,” she said. “That might just work.”</Text>

            <Synopsis>Annabel, Roderick, and Palmer continue to fight off the zombies. Eventually, Palmer is killed. Jonathan shows up to help, but he’s a bit late to the party.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The scientists had deserted the room.
“How did they get out?” Annabel asked Palmer. “Your map didn’t indicate another way out of this lab.”
“I don’t know,” he said. “It’s possible the Resurrectionists made some additions to the facility without my knowledge.”
“Never mind that,” said Roderick. “They’re going to get in.”
“Give me my gun,” Palmer asked.
Annabel stared hard at him. The door shuddered again. The zombies were going to get in, and soon. They needed Palmer’s help, if there was any chance at all they would survive this. She didn’t like giving Palmer a weapon, after he’d tried to hand her over to the Resurrectionists.
“I don’t have the right bullets for your pistol,” she said.
As for the guns she’d discarded earlier, they were still on the floor where she’d left them, with her crossbow. She had loaded up on Jonathan’s airship, and she hadn’t been shy about taking whatever she fancied. She picked up her crossbow first.
Then she grabbed a pepper-pot revolver, a Webley, and a pocket-sized derringer. She gave the Webley revolver to Palmer, the pepper-pot to Roderick, and tucked the derringer into her belt.
“Why does the Penny Dreadful have so many weapons on board, anyway?” she wondered.
“Jonathan’s father and I used to use the airship occasionally for our missions,” Palmer answered.
“Hunting zombies, you mean?”
“The tools of the trade,” he said, brandishing the Webley.
Then the door burst open, and all hell broke loose. It was impossible to count all the zombies that suddenly flooded into the room. They crammed into the wide doorway three at a time and spread into the room. Annabel, Roderick, and Palmer fanned out. She started firing the crossbow, and didn’t let up until she was out of bolts. Still, they poured into the room, climbing over the fallen until a pile of bodies lay blocking the doorway.
She tossed aside the crossbow and reached for the derringer as a zombie came flying toward her. She put a bullet in its skull and emptied the chamber of the pistol. The gunfire was deafening as they made their final stand.
Annabel discarded the empty derringer and cast about for something else she could use as a weapon. Something heavy and blunt, like a wrench, or something sharp. She didn’t have to look long. The room was filled with deadly objects.
Her eyes settled on a long, jagged knife of surgical steel. She snatched it off the table and returned to the fight with a dangerous gleam in her eye. If she was going out, she was going out fighting.
Dripping sweat, she grabbed the nearest cold body by the back of the head and jammed the knife into his eye. With a slurp like slicing open a watermelon, she slid the knife free. It tore against rotten flesh and bone, gore dripping from the shining instrument.
Cold surgical steel sliced into rotten flesh, cutting through gristle and tendons as easily as carving a roast. Her heart was racing, pounding madly in her chest, but she wasn’t afraid. Somehow, slicing through those rotten bodies gave her a strange sense of catharsis. It was exhilarating.
Grinning madly, she flicked her wrist and carved a piece out of any zombie that dared get in her way. She was drenched in blood, her white pants stained a deep, dark red.
Slabs of rotting meat began to pile up in the doorway, but still, they pressed forward. Annabel tried to get a count, but it was impossible to gauge how many there were with the door half-closed and their grunting, snarling faces so close to her own.
She planted a firm kick at one that had gotten too close for comfort, sending him sprawling backwards, but another one took his place. Intestines dangling, utterly naked, with blood in her blond hair, the zombie snapped her teeth, inches from Annabel’s neck. She heard a cry of pain from beside her, Palmer’s voice, but she had her own problems. She thrust her blade into the woman’s skull, heard the crunch of bone and brain, and moved on.
Killing the zombies was simple enough, now that she had the hang of it. She only had to destroy the brain. Any other wound would not suffice. Destroy the brain, and the body would go limp and cease attacking.
Easier said than done. Annabel grabbed the hilt of her blade, pulled it from the skull of her latest kill, and went for the next one. Her blade caught him beneath his jaw, aimed upward into the brain. He went limp. Again, she set her sights on another that had gotten too close, pulled the blade from the man’s jaw.
She cried out as two zombies grabbed her at once, one of them by the hair, the other by her mechanical arm. The blade clattered to the floor and disappeared as the zombies climbed over it. She felt another set of hands seize her as she fought to fend them off. Suddenly, her bloodlust turned to cold fear.
Her hair had come loose. One of the zombies had gotten hold of it. It was in her face. She couldn’t see. The zombie was pulling at her hair, sending searing pain into her scalp. Pulling at her hair, the zombie was trying to bring her head closer to his gaping mouth.
The second one was trying to get at her throat. She managed to hold him off with her arm.
The third one had suddenly let her go, and she heard the disturbing slop of something juicy being eaten. A squelching sound like rotten fruit being squished.
She couldn’t see with her hair in her face, but she detected the smell of warm blood mingled with the smell of rot. She heard the crunch of gnashing teeth, the zombies moans with pleasure.
Finally she managed to tear her hair free, and she saw Palmer’s body being ripped apart. It sent a jolt of fear through her—a horrible reminder of her fateful day in Haiti, her eye being ripped from its socket. She could almost feel Palmer’s pain as her own. Their grimy fingernails digging into his skin, pulling hot, steaming organs from his body. Their rotting teeth breaking the skin, tearing out layers of flesh. Palmer was already dead. She knew he couldn’t feel what was happening to him any more, but she started to scream.
She cast about for Roderick, but she couldn’t see him through all the carnage. Her screams fell silent, turned into a whimper as the zombies began to finish their meal. Once they were done with Palmer, they turned to Annabel. They set their blood-stained fingers on her cheeks and on her neck.
She raised her arm. It was all she could do to keep that one from getting at her neck. Her mechanical arm was dead weight; its gears were clogged with gore. Exhausted, disarmed, and terrified, she raised her left arm—her good arm. It was the only thing she could put between the zombie and her throat.
She felt a clump of hair tear out of her scalp, but suddenly she couldn’t see again. Her hair was in her face. She couldn’t see the dead man’s jaws close around her arm. But she could feel it.
He clamped down until his rotten teeth ripped through the fabric of her shirt and bit into her arm.
Suddenly, she heard gunfire, and she felt the cold hands being pried off of her. She dealt with the one on her arm, bashing him in the skull with her own, until his brittle bones caved in, and he stumbled back.
Clutching her wounded arm, she broke his legs with a sharp kick, and he fell to the ground. With a cry of rage and adrenaline, she stomped on his skull with her boot, killing him.
Panting with exhaustion, her face and hair slick with cold, resinous blood, she turned to see whoever had saved her. At first, she’d thought it was Roderick, firing his pepper-pot pistol.
But it was Jonathan she found before her. He was looking at her with a mixture of horror and relief. She offered him a smile, which given her current state, was probably not very comforting.
“What took you so long?” she asked. She’d intended it to sound playful, teasing, but relief crept into her voice.
Ignoring the question, he took a cautious step towards her. The last of the zombies were dead. She saw Roderick in the corner of her eye, leaning on his cane. She was glad to see he’d survived the fight.
“You’ve been bitten,” said Jonathan.
Annabel nodded.
“We should amputate,” he said. “Palmer said that might stop the virus from spreading.”
“There’s no way in hell you’re taking my other arm,” she said. “Besides, I’ve already been exposed to Lazarus. If it hasn’t killed me yet, I might actually be immune. We’ll have to wait and see what happens. Kill me if I turn zombie, but you’re not taking my damn arm.”
“Alright, alright,” said Jonathan. “We won’t take your arm. I’m just…I’m glad you’re alive.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene</Title>
            <Text>Roderick and Bailey had been up late, playing chess. The dog had won, but Roderick did not let that bother him. His mind hadn’t really been in it, and in his defense he’d been making Bailey’s moves for him. The game was mostly meant as a way to clear his head.
The truth was that although he’d put on an impressive display at Lord Connor’s manor, he had hardly any better idea of what was going on than did Scotland Yard.
He’d told Inspector Taggert his theory. Then he’d hailed a hansom cab to take him home for some much needed rest. But sleep hadn’t come. He was somewhat of a night owl anyway, and would often stay up well into the morning hours when working a case. He kept running over the events in his head. What if he’d done something different, figured it out more quickly? Could he have saved the policemen who’d been slain by the risen dead?
“The first of the two men who visited Lord Connor’s study was a thief. He entered Connor’s study with the intention of robbing the man’s safe. However, Connor was infected with that same strange affliction that caused his guests to rise from the dead, and attacked the would-be-thief.”
“A struggle took place, but the thief emerged victorious and followed through with his initial plan, breaking into the safe. He left the way he came, making a bit of a scene on his way out. The affliction began to spread. At some point during or shortly after all this, the second man entered Connor’s study; his intentions are unclear. Finding Connor already dead, he must have come to the conclusion that to be seen leaving Connor’s study would implicate him in the crime. He barred the door and made to flee via the window; his airship was parked outside. The door was broken down, but he had already escaped.”
“The affliction, by this point, was already spreading. This seems to have done an effective job of covering the tracks of both of the men involved. Only the one witness, Miss Karnstein, seems to have any information that may be of any use. Furthermore, someone returned after Connor’s guests were infected, in order to stage the scene, making it appear to be the work of Dr. Allen.”
“But why?” Taggert had wanted to know. “Why the coverup?”
“I’m not sure,” Roderick had admitted. “The evidence, that Mr. Sinews was involved in this crime, is circumstantial at best, which suggests that somebody wished to frame him. In other words, staging the scene may have more to do with framing Mr. Sinews than it does with covering up Lord Connor’s murder. I’ll want to interview Miss Karnstein. I’ll also need a list of all the guests who attended Connor’s ball.”
The detective had nodded, but Roderick was confident that the man’s tiny little brain was still slogging its way through the notion of dead men walking, and even Roderick was struggling to piece this mystery together. There were too many variables, too many unknowns. Most of what he’d pieced together so far was guesswork.
“I’ll also want to speak with Mr. Sinews,” he’d told the inspector. “I’m not remotely convinced of his guilt, but it may be that he has some information on the real culprits. In fact, it seems likely that he would. It would explain why they’ve attempted to silence him.”
“They?”
“It seems likely, doesn’t it, Inspector, that this was not the work of one man acting alone? Good evening Taggert. It’s been a long day. I trust you’ll send Scotland Yard’s best to tend to the remaining sick. And by tend to them, I do mean shoot them in the head. Seriously, Inspector, I would not take any chances.”
At home, Roderick ran his toes through the carpet, swallowed a morsel of hard toffee, and washed it down with a glass of milk. He wiped his mouth and looked down at Bailey, who was looking up at him expectantly.
“Very well, Bailey,” he said. “A stroll is likely just what I need to clear my head.”
Bailey wagged his tail enthusiastically, and Roderick patted his head affectionately. He pulled on a pair of socks and stuffed his feet into a pair of boots. Then he was out the door, letting his dog lead the way.
While he walked, his mind was at work. Bailey wandered the sidewalk, sniffing for squirrels and birds, and occasionally stopping to mark his territory, but Roderick paid him no mind.
He was mentally meandering through Lord Connor’s office, taking in the specks of blood on the door, rifling through the sheets of paper on his desk again. There was one page. One page that stood out, different from all the others. He’d flipped through the pages too quickly, and had missed it then. How that page had failed to stand out before, he couldn’t say; perhaps he’d been distracted. Perhaps he was just slipping. Either way, it had entered his subconscious mind, and the page stood out now.
One single sheet of paper, blank except for a sketch. No, not a sketch. A logo. Quickly flipping through the pages, vainly aiming to make an impression on the handsomely moustachioed policeman and not attentive to the details, he’d scarcely glanced at the sketch. For a man who prided himself on his keen intellect, he could be awfully dense at times. But now the image flashed back in his mind. A crow’s head.
“The symbol of the Resurrectionists,” he said aloud. “Quoth the raven,” he muttered. “Nevermore.”
How had he missed such an obvious clue? He’d been quick to dismiss the connection to the Resurrectionists; it was obvious that the garish Connor tableau was not the work of Dr. Allen. But that shouldn’t mean that the Resurrectionists were entirely uninvolved.
What did it mean, that Connor had one of their letters on his desk? A blank page with the Resurrectionists’s emblem. Could it mean…
Was Lord Connor a Resurrectionist? This certainly changed the focus of Roderick’s investigation. Whatever might have been in Connor’s safe was likely of importance to the Resurrectionists. Which meant that the thief was most likely a fellow member of that secret club.
He had to return to the Connor mansion. He needed to see it again. Perhaps with this newfound knowledge he would see something else that he had missed before.
“Bailey,” he called, rounding the corner to change directions. “This way.”
Silence greeted him in return. No jangling collar. No scampering feet. No hyperactively sniffing snout. Just the unnerving silence of a London that had gone to sleep. He whirled around, his eyes seeking out any sign of his furry friend. A single flickering gas lamp cast long shadows onto the square brick buildings that lined the road. It was nearly dawn, but the street was still dark.
“Bailey,” he called again.
A layer of fog drifted along the cobblestones. He heard a sound that might have been Bailey’s collar and spun in the direction of the sound. He saw only a chain attached to a locked gate, rattling in the wind.
“Bailey, where have you gone, boy?” he called out into the dark.
He stood, helpless, on the side of the street, his arms wide, imploring, calling Bailey to him.
Finally, a sound broke through the unnerving silence. The movement of feet. He followed the sound, despite the danger of wandering an alleyway alone, this late at night, in this city. Desperately.
Throwing caution to the wind, he stepped into the alley, following the footsteps into the darkness. His eyes still adjusting to the gloom, he made his way through the alley almost entirely by sound alone. The footsteps had stopped, but he followed them, until he nearly walked straight into their source.
A man stood there, still mostly indistinguishable in the darkness. His back was to Roderick, and in this dim light, he was more shadow than man. But perhaps he’d seen his dog. Perhaps Bailey had followed his scent in search of a new playmate.
Speaking of scent, even Roderick could have followed this man’s scent. He must have been living in this alleyway; even in the stench of London, the man’s smell was potent. He smelled sickly. Like walking death.
Roderick felt a knot beginning to form in the pit of his stomach. An unsettling chill that came not from the night’s cold breeze, but from a creeping suspicion.
“Sir,” he said, desperation overcoming his fear. “My dog,” he pleaded. “Have you seen my dog? He must have come this way.”
The man didn’t turn. Not right away. Just kept on chewing. Yes, he was eating something. Chewing noisily. The scent of fresh meat penetrated even the homeless man’s own sour stench of sweat and rot.
“Please,” said Roderick. “My dog…”
Finally, the man turned.
Roderick recoiled. His face. It was covered in blood and meat. He could see that, even in the darkness. Blood and meat. His teeth, glistening, red, chunks of meat between his teeth. Chewing noisily upon gristle and flesh. In his hands, a ravaged handful of meat and wet fur.</Text>
            <Comments>too silly?
Reading ahead, this line no longer makes sense.  Roderick does have an idea.  I would change this sentence to saying that he didn’t know for sure what happened, but could only go by what the evidence in the room gave him.
delete this? begin at the next paragraph?
revise
I would end the quote here and then include some action.  Like Roderick making the motions to leave, either by standing up or holding out his hand to shake the inspectors.  Then continue with him giving his goodbyes.  Some separation between the question and the farewell.
This sounds as though he is just getting home, and not picking up from before the explanation of his theory was given.  I suggest that you get rid of the first paragraph about him playing chess with the dog.
Is it the next day?
Before the dog was sniffing at birds and squirrels, I don’t personally recall seeing too many squirrels out at night.  Just noting that the time of day is unclear based on the bits of information.
oh no!  Poor Bailey.</Comments>

            <Title>Parson moved back across the tiny cell and sat down</Title>
            <Text>Parson Sinews moved back across the tiny cell and sat down upon the uncomfortable bed. He still had the alarming feeling that the floor was moving. It felt unsteady beneath his feet. Though he couldn’t quite shake the feeling, even when he sat down on the bed, he attempted to relax on the wooden frame.
The Mad Priest lingered by the bars that separated their cells. He stood there for a while without speaking, as if taking the time to formulate his thoughts, or perhaps he was just sleeping standing up.
“How do you imagine you’ll escape?” asked the priest.
“How do you know I was thinking of escaping?”
“Every prisoner imagines escaping,” Pieres answered. “It wouldn’t be a prison if the prisoners were content to stay put. After all—” He broke off at the sound of the guards making their rounds.
The small metal door slid open and a tray of something vaguely resembling food was shoved into his cell.
“What is this?” said Mr. Sinews, staring at the gruel.
“You were expecting tea and crumpets?” asked the guard. He laughed and marched onward.
Mr. Sinews groaned as he got out of bed and retrieved the meal. Cold porridge with a few dark brown chunks of what he hoped was dried fruit.
“You were saying?” he said, spooning some of the gruel into his mouth and attempting not to grimace at the taste and texture.
“Ah,” said the priest, “Well, merely that I’ve been here for something close to two years already. I’ve lost track of the days. Yet every day I’m confined in my cell, do you know what I think of?”
“Escape,” Parson answered.
“Escape,” the priest confirmed. He grunted appreciatively as he ate his meal, while Parson struggled to keep his down.
Mr. Sinews set down his meal.
“I imagine that after two years in this place, you have come up with some ideas…” he said.</Text>

            <Title>Scene Three</Title>
            <Text>The office in which they arrived was nearly identical to the one upstairs. Miss Monday had lost track of how many stories they’d descended to get here, but her ears had popped uncomfortably once or twice, so it must have been quite a few.
Mr. O released the latch of the elevator’s gate, and allowed Miss Monday to exit first. With undisguised relief, she exited the claustrophobic space, and entered Mr. O’s other office.
This one had curtains over the windows, like the one upstairs, though she suspected that if she were to pull them aside, she’d be looking at a bare wall. Still, they provided the comforting illusion that they were not several stories underground. The desk in this office was clearly used regularly. It was covered in scratches, coffee stains, and loosely organised sheets of dog-marked and crumpled papers. While the stacks of paper upstairs had been manuscript submissions and query letters from prospective authors, here the documents that lay upon the desk appeared to be mission logs. Miss Monday skimmed through some of the documents at the top of the pile as she perused the office.
Mr. O stood against the wall near the false window, looking at her with curiosity and amusement, his arms folded casually as he leaned back, suppressing a grin.
“What?” said Miss Monday, when she noticed he had caught her snooping at the files on his desk.
“Nothing,” he said with a shrug. “Shall we?”
He stood up from the windowsill and crossed the room. Miss Monday followed him to the door, though she was beginning to feel more than ever like she had tumbled down a rabbit hole.
As Mr. O had pointed out, she had seen Lord Connor herself, cadaverous in appearance and hungry for her flesh. She had more reason than anyone to believe Mr. O’s claim, that the unliving creatures spoken of only by the most superstitious of people, ghouls which could rise after death to prey upon the living, were real.
But her scepticism still continued to rise up and object even to what she had seen with her own eyes. Surely, Lord Connor had merely been afflicted by an unknown disease, one which caused his skin to appear rotten and grey, and his mind to betray him.
Of course, if that were true, then Mr. O was clearly every bit as insane as Lord Connor had been, as he had built a secret underground facility devoted to hunting ghouls that did not exist. Not for the first time, she wondered why she was still following him. She hesitated at the doorway.
Then, forcing her doubts down as if swallowing a bitter draught, she followed him out of his office.
His office led to a lobby, so obviously Mr. O’s hidden elevator was not the only way of accessing the basement. There was a desk pushed back against the wall. Sitting at the desk, Mr. O’s secretary bent over a ledger, her feather pen darting quickly across the pages. She lifted her head as Miss Monday exited the office.
“Miss Monday,” said Mr. O, “This is Mrs. Hallward.”
But when her eyes met Mrs. Hallward’s, she had to bite her tongue. Pretty, young, with her long locks of auburn hair pulled up tied into a neat knot, Mrs. Hallward looked quite a bit different from the last time she’d seen her, half-naked and wearing makeup, but she was unmistakably the same woman. She saw a flash of recognition pass across Mrs. Hallward’s face, but it was quickly suppressed.
She knew Mrs. Hallward by another name. Miss Thompson.
She wanted to say, “We’ve met,” but she decided to keep this to herself, so she simply said, “Hello.”
Mrs. Hallward’s eyes said a silent “thank you” for the confidentiality, and Miss Monday nodded. Suddenly she noticed that Mr. O had already left the room, and she’d been staring at Mrs. Hallward. She hurriedly left the room.
In the hall, Mr. O pulled a cord that hung from the ceiling, and a series of lamps began to switch on, automatically, one after another. Leaving his office behind, they made their way along the brightly lit hallway. Following a similar floor plan to the literary agency upstairs, the layout of Mr. O’s secret basement lair, as Miss Monday had begun to think of it, seemed to be a square, with office doors all along one side of the hallway and a large room in the centre of the square. There were plaques on each of the office doors, much like upstairs.
Mr. O, Director
Mr Abraham Palmer, Agent
Bartholemew White, Agent
Rémy Mills, Agent
Mrs. Elizabeth Grimmer, Chief Financial Officer
“My mother,” Mr. O remarked as he passed that door.
“And Mr. Grimmer?” Miss Monday asked casually.
A flicker of emotion passed through Mr. O’s face, perhaps for the first time. His lips tightened.
“I’m sorry,” she said.
He nodded, quietly.
They passed another door.
Lord Henry Connor, Agent
Miss Monday stared at Mr. O in surprise. He nodded and provided her with an unapologetic shrug. Mr. O had told her that Connor had hunted the unliving, but she hadn’t realised he had worked directly with Mr. O.
She gave a start when she noticed that Mr. O had carried on down the hallway without her, and she had to hurry to catch up.
The next door they came to was not labelled with the name of any person, but was simply called Alpha Laboratory. Mr. O paused here, and reached into his waistcoat pockets. There was a jingling sound as he fished out a set of keys and began to sort through them. Finding the right one, he unlocked the door.
Miss Monday waited at the doorway while Mr. O went inside and worked at lighting the room’s lamps. Even before he’d finished his task, she’d caught a glimpse of an image that would undoubtedly haunt her dreams that night and for nights to come.
She choked back a cry of horror as she stared at an enormous, cylindrical fish tank of thick glass, which stood on one side of the room, the contents of the tank becoming more clear as each new lamp cast light upon the room.
“Oh dearest God in heaven,” she said quietly, “What in the name of Fuck am I looking at?”
Mr. O shrugged, though his tone of voice was far from his usual nonchalance when he replied. “An experiment,” he said grimly.</Text>

            <Title>Scene 29</Title>
            <Synopsis>Taggert, Hargrave, and Roderick run through the zombie-infested city, and quickly become separated from Hargrave (was he bitten?). Hargrave catches up, and they decide to go to Newgate to find Parson Sinews.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Roderick brandished his blood-encrusted letter opener like it was a sword. It was all that stood between him and a city full of zombies.
“What now?”
Inspector Taggert was still looking to Roderick for answers. This didn’t seem the appropriate time to remind him that Roderick was an artist and Taggert a Police Inspector. Roderick swept his eyes across the scene, making a quick mental calculation.
“We need to know how far this thing has spread,” he said.
Even now, the dead were standing up and closing in on them, drawn to the living men like moths to the flame. The little boy was quickest; his flesh had barely begun to rot, so he was almost as quick as a living child. At first, he began walking towards the three men, but as he drew closer, he began to sprint. His mouth was dripping with blood.
Taggert and Hargrave shrank back, startled by how quickly the child was closing in on them, probably too afraid to kill a child. But Roderick saw gristle and meat in the boy’s teeth, and the blood that stained his chin, and readied his letter opener.
When the child reached him, he trust the blade into the soft spot beneath the boy’s chin. The boy stopped moving. Roderick slid his blade free, as the child hit the ground.
“Quickly now,” Roderick said, not allowing himself to dwell on what he’d just done. If he allowed himself to feel guilty, he wouldn’t survive. The policemen were still frozen in place. Hargrave was shaking. Roderick worried the man might actually soil himself.
“Follow me,” he said, taking his eyes off the slain child.
He began to run, his footsteps echoing across the square. Attracted to the noise and to Roderick’s motion, the zombies left off whatever they were doing and staggered after. He zig-zagged around them, dodging their clumsy attempts to grab him. He leapt over a half-eaten corpse, and sprinted past a crowd of zombies that were limping after him.
He ran on, until his lungs burned. At each turn, the zombies were in evidence. He turned onto a sidestreet and nearly collided with a man in a top hat.
“Sorry,” he wheezed.
The man turned around, snarling, his eyes dead and hungry. Roderick shoved him back, and kept on running. At last, he found a vacant street, and slowed to a halt, gasping for breath.
Holding his side and struggling to breathe, Taggert ran up and came to a halt beside him.
“Where’s Hargrave?” Roderick asked.
Taggert looked over his shoulder, apparently surprised Hargrave wasn’t there. He looked back to Roderick and gave him a worried look.
“I don’t know,” he said, “We’ve got to go back.”
Roderick ran a hand through his hair. It was damp with sweat. He couldn’t remember having taken his hat off, but he wasn’t wearing it now. He was barefoot. He felt a few drops of rain, and then all at once, the sky opened up. It began to pour. Roderick might have laughed, but he was still out of breath.
He couldn’t think. This street wouldn’t be safe for long, though. Soon enough, a zombie would stumble its way down this street and find them.
A clockwork bird had apparently been used at Connor’s mansion to distribute a poison gas that infected those who breathed it. The gas killed its victims quickly, then undid its work by bringing them back to life, as zombies. Roderick considered his many conversations with Parson Sinews, about the Resurrectionists. Anthony Tidkins had been obsessed with bringing the dead back to life, ever since he discovered the zombies of Haiti. Ever since, he had been trying to replicate a sickness that he called the Lazarus Virus.
He had done it, Roderick realized. He had finally managed to replicate the Lazarus Virus, and he had unleashed it at Lord Connor’s, killing the aristocracy in one fell swoop.
They were several blocks from Lincoln’s Inn Fields. One small clockwork bird couldn’t have spread the gas this this far. Which meant there must have been more than one of these clockwork birds. And since Roderick had no idea how many, he had no idea how far the virus had spread. For all he knew, all of London might have been infected.
“We need to find the Resurrection Man,” he said.
“Now? That’s what you’re worried about?” asked Taggert
“He unleashed this virus. If there is a cure, he may know.”
“And what about Hargrave?” Taggert demanded.
Roderick sighed. “Fine. We’ll double back to Lord Connor’s, see if we can find him.”
“No need,” said a voice.
Taggert and Roderick whirled, and found Hargrave stumbling out of an alleyway, looking a bit worse for wear.
“Hargrave, thank god, man,” Taggert cried with relief, “What happened?”
“Sorry, sir,” he said, “A few of those rotters got in my way. I managed to fight my way free, but I lost sight of you. I’m lucky I found you.”
“Are you hurt?” Roderick asked.
Hargrave shook his head. “I’m fine.”
Roderick narrowed his eyes. Hargrave’s shirt was stained with blood, and his hands were scraped and bloody. Might not have been his own blood, though. He nodded. “Right then. It’s time we caught the Resurrection Man.”
“We’ve already caught him,” Taggert said.
Roderick raised an eyebrow.
“Parson Sinews,” Taggert reminded him.
In all the chaos, Roderick had forgotten that Sinews was Taggert’s chief suspect and had been arrested.
“We sent the Black Marias to arrest him earlier. He’ll be at Newgate by now.”
“Assuming Newgate isn’t compromised,” Roderick said.
“Zombies, you mean?” asked Hargrave.
“Zombies,” Roderick confirmed.</Text>

            <Comments>   All right, I told you about my formula.  I write in Shifting Viewpoint.  That is third person, non-omnipotent scenes.  You've been reading BtR, and it's a fine example.  Most of the viewpoints are from the protagonist, which in BtR can be any member of the Ketrel's crew.  Those account for about 60% of the viewpoints.  About a quarter of those are from the viewpoint of the "Distraction," which in this case is Jinx.  The Distraction is a character I use to keep the protagonists from concentrating exclusively on their main job.  This keeps the hero(es) from dealing with the wolf at the door, because they have to manage the termites in the basement at the same time.  In a pure romance, the Distraction is the rival for the (usually) woman's affection.  The rest of the viewpoints are divided as needed, but more or less equally, between the antagonist (Reinhard), the hero's confidant (the British soldiers, Cole and Sanderson), and the villain's henchman (Mutala).  When we are in one character's head, we cannot be aware of anything that he can't know about, so you can't say, "But she didn't see the man slipping into her room as she departed," because "she" didn't see it.  The only way to approximate that would be to start a new scene from the point of view of the person slipping into "her" room, and describe what he is doing.  For a 100- 110,000 page target, I would shoot for 88 scenes ranging from 1,000 to 1,500 words each, with four scenes to a chapter, but these are only rules of thumb; use as many scenes of whatever length that you need.  For a target of 110- to 130,000 words, use five viewpoints (the fifth one is an ambiguous character who may be good or bad, but we don't find out until the end; maybe not then, if you want him or her to be a recurring "guest.")  Whatever the case, put a couple of plot twists, or "surprises," at the 1/4 and 3/4 marks (in BtRIII, this is where Jinx presented herself aboard the Kestrel and asked for a charter.), and a bone-jarring twist at the center point.  This is the last scene in Chapter 12; you'll see what I mean when you eventually read it.
   This is of necessity very truncated and generalized.  The original formula is laid out in a 230-page how-to-write book whose techniques I have modified to fit my own writing style.  It is a very disciplined style that keeps me on the task of telling the story without rambling, and may not work for you if you are a more chaotic composer, but knowing what the viewpoints are, and what proportion of scenes each character should have can only help.
   This is certainly not an attempt to change the way you write, but a piece of information for you to use in any way that might help you.  Feel free to ask me anything about it, or about anything.  If I've learned anything during the journey that is likely to help you, I'll be glad to pass it along.

            <Title>Parson Sinews woke up violently, sitting up abruptly</Title>
            <Text>Three Years Earlier

The Mad Priest heard the man in the next cell stirring. He peered through the bars between their cells and could make out a dimly lit figure jolting suddenly, as if waking from a nightmare. He heard the new prisoner gasp for air as if he hadn’t been breathing. The priest watched him sit there panting for a moment, catching his breath. “It felt so real,” the priest heard him muttering to himself. “It felt so real.”
The Mad Priest tapped on the bars with his cane and saw a pair of green eyes flash in the darkness of the prisoner’s cell.
“I looked into Camille’s eyes,” the prisoner mumbled. “I saw her, dead. But Camille isn’t dead. She dragged me to this hell hole.”
The Mad Priest frowned. “You were dreaming," he said. "It was just a dream."
“What was that?”
“Are you awake?” asked the Mad Priest.
The new prisoner turned at the sound of his voice.
The cell was too dimly lit to make out the details of the shadowy figure from within, but he could see that the man was looking at him.
“Who’s there?” the prisoner called.
“Ah,” the Mad Priest answered, as the shadow moved toward him, “You are awake. You know, you talk in your sleep. Makes it difficult to tell if you’re awake or not.”
Finally, the man’s face appeared between the bars, and the Mad Priest could make out his features. Young, impossibly handsome, his eyes the color of emeralds. He wore the clothes of a gentleman, but they were worn. His eyes were intelligent, dangerous even, but they were unfocused as if he’d been drugged.
“Father Pieres,” he said, “though the guards call me ‘The Mad Priest.’ A little joke they have.”
His cellmate didn’t offer his own name, but the priest didn’t mind. He was relieved to have any company at all. He’d been alone for far too long.
“The Mad Priest? As in The Count of Monte Cristo?” the prisoner asked.
The priest nodded.
“I suppose that makes me Edmond Dant—” The prisoner stopped suddenly. “This is Chateau d’If.”
His voice sounded suddenly alert.
“That’s where I am, isn’t it? They said they were going to take me to a place called Chateau d’If.”
The priest nodded. “Named after the prison in Dumas’ novel, which is of course, based on the real Chateau d’If in Marseilles.”
“We are not in Marseilles, though, are we?”
The priest shook his head.
“How did you end up here?” asked the new prisoner, obviously trying to make sense of his new surroundings. The man’s voice dripped with arrogance and disbelief. This was not a man accustomed to being imprisoned.
Pieres shrugged. “Saw something they didn’t want me to see.”
“Who didn’t want you to see?”
“Ah,” said the priest, “Isn’t that obvious?”
“Resurrectionists,” the prisoner said. The floor swayed beneath their feet, and the priest leaned on his cane for balance. The prisoner grasped the bars and swayed. He put a hand to his head as if he believed the swaying floor was just a lingering effect of the drugs. The priest wondered if he should tell the man the truth. Later, he decided. There would be time for that later.
“What sort of prison is this?” asked the prisoner.
“Ah,” said Pieres, scratching his beard as he talked, “It’s a very special kind of prison is what it is. You and I have both seen things we weren’t meant to see, haven’t we? That knowledge makes us dangerous to them. They send us here so we don’t interfere with their agendas.”
“And why not just kill us?” asked the prisoner. “They’re obviously not above killing.”
“I like to think they haven’t killed me because I’m more valuable to them alive,” Pieres answered.
“Somehow I don’t find that thought altogether comforting.”
“As long as you’re alive, there is hope,” said the priest.
“You’re right,” said the prisoner with the bright green eyes. “There is hope, because one day, I’m going to get out of this cell. And when I do, I’m going to kill the ones responsible for putting me here. Come a little closer, Father.”
The priest was already standing as close as he could get, so he reached his hand between the bars and put his hand on the prisoner’s face. It was cold.
Pieres looked into the man’s green eyes and felt his head begin to swim.
“What can I do for you, my son?” Pieres asked, his voice low and soft.
“I need fresh blood, Father,” the prisoner answered. Those emerald eyes were piercing. They bore into the priest’s soul, dissecting him with a look. Pieres felt giddy, as if drunk.
“Of course, my son,” the priest answered, stifling a giggle. He offered up his wrist, and he felt the prisoner bite into his flesh.
He felt the blood drain from his wrist, but he felt delirious with pleasure. His knees bent, and he knelt on the cold floor. The prisoner continued to drink until his pale face flushed. He wiped his mouth on a cloth, giving the Mad Priest a glimpse of his sharp teeth. He tucked the cloth kerchief into his pocket and helped the priest to his feet.
Father Pieres couldn’t remember why he’d been kneeling.
“Thank you,” he said, assuming he’d taken a fall and the prisoner had helped him up. “I’m Father Pieres,” he said. He couldn’t remember if he’d said that already.
“A pleasure,” said the prisoner in the opposite cell. “My name is Parson Sinews.”</Text>
            <Comments>The man in the next cell woke up violently. The Mad Priest peered through the bars between their cells and watched the new prisoner sit abruptly and
(Weak usage.  It distracts.  ‘jolted awake’ or ‘sit bolt-upright’ or something more powerful would be better.  If you change at least one –ly, then using the other won’t stand out so much. ) 
(This is in opposition to the scene you just set.  He was watching what the man was doing—then it became so dark all he could see was the flash of his eyes?  This is confusing.  What happened?)
          --  Supplemental note:  Ah, so you were trying to highlight the glowing, hypnotic eyes.  Good idea, but I don’t think it works well this way.  It’s just confusing. 
The cell was too dimly lit to make out the shadowy figure from within, but he could see that the man was looking at him.
(Again, your use of darkness is confusing here.  If he couldn’t make out the figure, he couldn’t see that he was looking at him.  A ‘shadowy figure’ is what you see in the dark.  Perhaps a change to something like:
The cell was too dimly lit to make out any details of the shadowy figure from within, but he could see that the man was looking at him. )
“Who’s there?” said the prisoner. 
( ‘asked’ or ‘called’ the prisoner.  ‘said’ transmits no energy into your work.) 

(clip that since the man offers his name in the very next line.)

He looked into the man’s green eyes and felt his head begin to swim.
“What can I do for you, my son?” he asked, his voice low and soft.
“I need fresh blood, Father,” he answered. His eyes were piercing. They bore into the priest’s soul, dissecting him with a look. He felt giddy, as if drunk.
(A confusing number of ‘he/his’ in this section.  It slows the reader while s/he is trying to unravel which ‘he’ is which.)

            <Title>Scene</Title>
            <Text>The Penny Dreadful was swift, its propellors and sails and ornithopteresque wings driving it to the edge of the city. Another cup of tea sat empty. Annabel reached for the pot with her mechanical arm and poured herself another cup. Jonathan stared at her with a strange look upon his face.
“I’m just pouring a cup of tea, Jonathan. Nothing to marvel at,” she told him.
He grinned.
“On the contrary, you are a constant marvel, my dear Miss Monday.”
She rolled her eyes, both the real and the mechanical one. The lens clicked and whirred as it spun on its gears.
“Annabel,” she said. “You can call me Annabel.”
Jonathan smiled. “Annabel it is.”
“So, what now?” asked Mrs. Thompson. “Where do we go from here? Surely we can’t stay in London.”
“You’re right. For now, I’ve asked the captain to get us out of the city. And then, we need to find out more about Chateau d’If. The Resurrectionists are still out there. And they have my mother.”
“Not to mention Parson Sinews,” said Annabel. “You know, there’s something terribly odd about that man. I can’t quite put my finger on it, but I feel certain he’ll have some part to play in all of this.”
Roderick looked, for a moment, as though he was going to offer some insight into Parson Sinews, but seemed to think better of it. “There’s also the matter of finding a cure,” he said instead, “The Resurrectionists managed to escape with most of their research papers, unfortunately—”
“Most?”
“Well, I did manage to abscond with this,” he replied, unfolding a sheet of paper, which he took from his pocket. “Nothing to do with the cure, but get this,” he said, and turning his eyes to the page, he read aloud, “Certain species of insects are known to react to the Lazarus Virus, undergoing extreme, rapid growth, as well as demonstrating certain metamorphic qualities.”
“Meta-what?” said Mrs. Thompson.
“Metamorphic. A transformation, like a caterpillar into a butterfly.”
“Wonderful,” said Clementine. “Zombie bugs. As if zombie people wasn’t bad enough.”
“My god,” Kip added in agreement.
As they spoke, the ship had been steadily descending. As the fog cleared in front of the ship, an unsettling vision came into view through the windows. An enormous wall had risen up, lining the edge of the city. Zombies were clawing at it, trying unsuccessfully to scale its heights and get at the men in the towers.
“What on earth,” Annabel exclaimed, getting out of her seat and heading over to the window for a better view. A moment later she was joined by Jonathan, Roderick, Kass, Kip, and Mrs. Thompson. They gaped at the wall in silence.
It was vast, stretching as far as they could see in either direction. It was several stories tall, with gun turrets positioned around it. Though the wall was obviously makeshift, pieced together with lengths of sheet metal and plywood, it was enough that the zombies could neither scale its heights nor topple the wall. Even so, it was difficult to imagine how it could have been assembled so quickly, unless it had been built in advance, in anticipation of Dead London. Which meant that it could only have been built by Resurrectionists, or Resurrectionist sympathizers. Annabel remembered what Palmer had said about Queen Victoria. Even she was suspected of supporting the Dead London project.
“They’re quarantining the city,” said Kass. “Trying to keep the zombies inside.”
“What about the living?” Annabel exclaimed. “There are still survivors living in the city. They’ll be trapped inside with them.”
“Soon won’t be too many living people left,” said Kip.
“God,” Annabel breathed. “It really will be Dead London. A city of the walking dead. Can we get any lower?”
The ship was circling near the wall, just outside the range of the wall’s gun turrets. Just then, the captain’s voice came through the speaking tube, distorted and tinny as it resonated from a little metal box in the top right corner of the lounge.
“Mr. Grimmer, you’re needed on deck, please.”
“Excuse me a moment,” said Jonathan. To Annabel, he added, “I’ll see about getting us lower.”
While he left to confer with the captain, Annabel remained intent on the window. She was staring at the men on the gun turrets. Their weapons were aimed at the zombies, but they weren’t firing. So long as the zombies could not reach them, they did not pose a threat, she supposed.
Another minute or two passed in relative silence, the airship hovering in place, until with a hiss of air the ship began to descend. At last, they drew close enough to distinguish the shape of the gas masks that the men at the turrets were wearing. They were corvine in shape, the masks of plague doctors.
“Resurrectionists.”
Of course, while they could now see the Resurrectionists clearly, they too could be seen. The Resurrectionists turned their attention from the zombies to the airship. One of them—Annabel couldn’t make out which one—spoke, using some sort of device to project their voice. It sounded tinny and inhuman, like the Captain’s through the speaking tube.
“This city is under quarantine. No citizens are to leave without clearing inspection. By the order of the British Military, turn your airship around.”
She looked at Kass, but she was stoic and unreadable. She wasn’t sure if that was sang-froid or if she was just keeping her fears to herself. Mrs. Thompson, meanwhile, was fanning herself, her eyes wide.
The Resurrectionist’s voice interrupted her thoughts, loud enough to hear even over the rumble of the ship’s engines.
“Again, this city is under quarantine. Turn your ship around. If you do not comply, it will be taken as a hostile act, and we will open fire upon your vessel.”
In reply, a voice came through the speaking tube again. It was Jonathan’s voice, however, not Captain Merrick’s.
“All hands on deck. We’re going to fight back.”
“Fight back?” Annabel repeated. “Against their gun turrets?”
Kass grinned. “Oh, you haven’t seen what this beauty can do,” she said. “Oh, she might look like a civilian vessel, but Mr. Grimmer had the Dreadful built to support his Hunting Society. She’s not exactly unarmed.”
“I’ll take the portside cannon,” said Kip.
Annabel’s eyes widened. Cannon?
“Starboard cannon’s got my name on it,” said Kass. “I’ll raise the shields.”
“Miss Monday, the gatlin’ gun’s all yours,” said Kip. “Let’s blow these Resurrectionists t’ smithereens.”
Annabel shared a grin with Kass.
“Gatling gun, eh?” she said.
Kass nodded. “I’ll show you.”
Annabel followed her through the door. They headed topside, and Kass showed her to her station. As promised, the gatling gun stood front and center, a huge cannon on either side of the ship.
Kass pressed a button at her side. The airship shuddered and a series of metal panels raised, covering the windows and gasbags. The Resurrectionists’ guns were aimed at the ship, but the metal shields afforded them some protection. Hopefully that would be enough to stop their bullets from puncturing the ballonets.
Annabel settled into her station, closing her one eye against the fierce, cold wind. She’d never used a gun like this before, so she took a moment to examine it while the Resurrectionist guns rang out, pinging against the metal shields. The shields seemed like flimsy protection at best. The metal was too thin to hold out for long, and there were gaping holes in their protective space.
With Clem’s help, it didn’t take Annabel long to figure out how to work the gun. Once it was ready, she aimed with her mechanical eye, and began firing. She cackled wildly as the gun let loose an onslaught of bullets, and the Resurrectionist fell from his post, only to be seized by the zombies below.
“God bless you, Dr. Gatling!” she cried triumphantly.
Kass left her to her devices, heading for the starboard cannon.
Annabel aimed the weapon at the next Resurrectionist and gave him the same fate as his friend. The Penny Dreadful shuddered as Kip fired his cannon, and again as Kass did the same. Kip’s cannonball missed its mark, sailing over the wall, but Kass’s struck home, utterly destroying one of the gun towers.
The Resurrectionists continued to fire back, while the zombies below cried out for flesh. And through it all, Annabel continued to aim and fire, laughing wildly each time a Resurrectionist fell victim to her onslaught. And when each of the turrets in their way stood unmanned, The Penny Dreadful lowered its shields, and continued on its way.</Text>
            <Comments>2 cannon and a gatling gun ain't even close to a dreadnought 'she's got a sting in her tail' or 'she bites back' would fit a lot better here.

made it back to his place, not Roderick's
'yore's' doesn't work 'yorn' is better
shields over the windows would do nothing to protect the gas bags, something about metallic cloth stopping the bullets would make more sense</Comments>
            <Notes>
“No.” The captain’s voice again. “That one’s for the shields. Look, just let me do it.”
There was an audible click, and then the voices cut off. Annabel headed for the door, and with Mr. Ocelot and Mrs. Hatton in her wake, she headed topside. Mr. O and Captain Merrick were standing in the Captain’s Nook at the bow of the airship. </Notes>

            <Title>“Well, I must say, I like your timing</Title>
            <Text>“Thanks,” said Jonathan Grimmer, scrambling up on the clock tower beside Annabel. “You look different,” he said.
Annabel rolled her eyes, including the one made of brass and glass, which rotated with a whir and a click. She did look different. Her hair was shorter than it had been last time she’d seen him. She caught Jonathan eying her tattooed bicep; that was new.
“Are those—”
“Tally marks,” she finished. “Yes. One for every zombie I’ve killed. Can we do this later?”
“What?”
“The touching reunion,” she said. “Let’s save it. In case you hadn’t noticed, there’s a giant zombie cockroach airship rampaging through town.”
Jonathan looked at the creature in question and watched it plough through the town bank, creating a cascade of rubble and brick dust. The grenade hadn’t killed it. The Penny Dreadful, miraculously, was still afloat, but it wasn’t firing on the beast any more. If Dr. Sound could get the second grenade into its monstrous jaws, they might be able to finish the thing off, but the ship was out of cannonballs and ammunition for the Maxim gun.
“Is that what that thing is? A cockroach?” Jonathan wondered. “I didn’t know cockroaches could fly.”
“Do I look like a bloody entomologist? I don’t know what it is; I just want it dead.”
Jonathan gave her a nod, and even just that made her realize she’d missed him, not that she’d ever admit it to him. They’d split up just a few months ago, when Annabel had gotten a tip from one of her old contacts about the whereabouts of Dr. Jekyll, one of the founding members of the Resurrectionists. Jonathan, meanwhile, had been pursuing a lead of his own, trying to find his mother, who they believed was at Chateau d’If. She let out a quick sigh. Like she’d said, there would be time for a touching reunion later. She returned her attention to the overgrown insect.
“Any idea how we go about that?” Jonathan asked her.
“Actually,” she answered, “why don’t we start by clipping its wings? You think our friends could give us a lift?” She gestured to the Penny Dreadful. “You’ve given me an idea, Jonathan.”
His eyes widened. “I have?”
Annabel nodded, running a hand through her hair. She flashed her dimples. “Yeah. A very interesting idea. Now, how do we get back on that ship?”
“Don’t suppose you’ve got a flare gun?” Jonathan asked.
Annabel shook her head.
“Well, we could…yell…really loudly…” he suggested, and trailed off.
Silence hung between them, and lingered, as Annabel tried to resist the urge to laugh. The sad thing was, she couldn’t come up with a better idea. Finally, she cupped her hands together in front of her mouth and started to shout at the top of her lungs. Meanwhile, Jonathan stood and waved his arms over his head, joining her in hollering at the airship. They kept that up for about a minute, when Annabel’s throat began to hurt from the effort.
“They’re not going to hear us over the engines and all the noise that thing’s making,” she said, defeated.
They stopped shouting as the enormous insect continued its rampage, toppling a pair of trees that stood in its way. Then it turned, and began to head straight toward the clock tower.
“Bugger,” Annabel swore.
The Dreadful hadn’t heard their shouting, but the insect had spotted them. Who knew how the creature’s hearing worked, but its eyes were at the top of its head, and its eyes had hundreds of lenses, giving it a near three sixty degree view of its surroundings. If the creature hadn’t heard them shouting, it still could have spotted them.
The one remaining Resurrectionist had taken over the ship’s controls and was furiously handling the many levers and dials that controlled the ship’s trajectory. Whether this was his intent or not, the insect was headed straight for them. Annabel suspected the creature had complete autonomy, the way the pilot was yanking frantically on the controls. Even if she could take out the pilot, it probably wouldn’t stop the creature from rampaging.
Its wings a-blur, it raced toward them. Its face was half destroyed, split almost in half by the blast of the grenade. Annabel notched her crossbow and fired a bolt as it approached. The projectile bounced off the creature’s chitinous armor. She fired another, to no effect.
In one last desperate bid, she tried aiming for the pilot. The bolt whistled as she pulled the trigger on the bow. She saw him slump in his seat, his head crashing down onto the controls with her bolt in his neck. Still, the ship kept coming.
“Jonathan, do something!”
He nodded. “I’d love to, but—”
He broke off, suddenly reaching up to grab hold of something swinging towards them. He caught it and handed it to Annabel. It was a rope ladder. There was no time to think about it. She simply grabbed hold of the rungs and started to climb, with Jonathan scrambling up after her. A moment later, the abominable insect crashed into the clock tower. Metal struts screamed and bricks crashed to the ground below, but the creature barely slowed. Its mouth opened, trying to catch Jonathan in its fearsome mandibles.
Annabel scrambled further up the ladder, looking up to see the Penny Dreadful above. She thanked her lucky stars that Captain Merrick was at the helm. No other pilot could have commanded a ship of the Dreadful’s size so precisely and so quickly. As it happened, she’d been in just this very situation before, climbing up the Dreadful’s rope ladder for dear life. That time, there’d been a hundred ravenous zombies below. This time, it was just one zombie, but it was no less terrifying.
She reached the top of the ladder and climbed over the edge and onto the deck. The airship was in rough shape. The floorboards were splintered, the protective steel panels had been disassembled and discarded. Some of the crew had been killed in the battle, and their bodies still littered the deck. She gave Jonathan a hand as he scrambled over the deck after her, then she turned to the ship’s pilot.
“Good to see you, Miss Grey,” he said.
“And you, Mr. Lockwood. Listen, I have an idea for how to deal with that thing.”
“I’m all ears, Miss Grey,” the pilot replied, sticking to formality. “Just tell me what you need.”</Text>
            <Notes>He stepped to the edge of the clock tower, then dove off the edge. Her eyes widened. That wasn’t what she’d meant.
He crashed through the open window and landed in the cockpit of the Resurrectionist airship, in the belly of the beast. In a second, the creature would crash into the clock tower, toppling it. The abominable insect opened its jaws, tried to chomp down on Annabel. She dove off the edge of the tower, following Jonathan’s lead. She crashed through the 
She groaned and reached for something to hold on to.</Notes>

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Synopsis>Annabel concludes her story. She admits that Anthony had been like a father to her but that after she lost her eye and arm, she lost him as well. She believed that Anthony always had valued every human life; he had always been a bit strange, a bit mad even, but it had been tough to swallow the idea that the plan to destroy the entire city had been his alone, except that it was to save his father.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The Penny Dreadful was swift, its propellors and sails and ornithopteresque wings driving it to the edge of the city. Another cup of tea sat empty. Annabel reached for the pot with her mechanical arm and poured herself another cup. Mr. O stared at her with a strange look upon his face? She rolled her eyes—both real and mechanical—at him.
“I’m just pouring a cup of tea, Jonathan. Nothing to marvel at,” she told him.
He grinned.
“On the contrary, you are a constant marvel, my dearest Annabel.”
She blushed, only now realising that she’d called him by his Christian name. That he’d done the same in kind meant he was either teasing her or flirting with her. Either way, her cheeks took on a scarlet hue.
“What do you think became of Mrs. Grimmer?” said Henry Charles Ocelot, sparing her.
At this, it was Mr. O’s turn to be embarrassed. After all, it was for his sake that they’d all put their trust in Mrs. Grimmer in spite of their reservations. And even he hadn’t trusted her. In his defence, he had confronted her, but that had only resulted in a tranquilizer dart to the neck. Still, Mr. O was infuriatingly bad at being embarrassed. He recovered from it in an instant.
“I imagine she’s halfway to Paris by now, or wherever the next closest Resurrectionist hideout might be. Probably left the city the very moment she sent us on that wild goose chase.”
“Sent most of us on the wild goose chase,” Annabel retorted, “While you remained unconscious.”
Mrs. Hatton smirked.
“She’s got you there,” she told Mr. O.
He shrugged and reached for his cup. To his apparent surprise, his glass was empty.
“Anyway,” he continued, “I’m certain we’ve not seen the last of The Resurrectionists. They had members within Scotland Yard—we witnessed Parson Sinews apparent arrest, which as it turned out was actually an abduction; within the aristocracy—Lord Connor was a Resurrectionist; and within the military—remember that Dr. Allen’s experiments were sanctioned. We may have destroyed their headquarters, but we haven’t stopped their operations.”
“Nor have we stopped the Dead London project,” Henry Charles Ocelot pointed out.
The ship had steadily been descending. As the fog cleared in front of the ship, an unsettling vision came into view through the windows. An enormous wall had risen up, lining the edge of the city. The zombies were clawing at it, trying unsuccessfully to scale its heights and get at the men in the towers.
“What on earth,” Annabel exclaimed, getting out of her seat and heading over to the window for a better view. A moment later she was joined by Mr. O, Mr. Ocelot, and the elderly Mrs. Hatton, who gaped at the wall in silence.
It was vast, stretching as far as they could see in either direction. It was several stories tall, with gun turrets positioned around it. Though the wall was obviously makeshift, pieced together with lengths of sheet metal and plywood, it was enough that the zombies could neither scale its heights nor topple the wall. Even so, it was difficult to imagine how it could have been assembled so quickly, unless it had been built in advance, in anticipation of Dead London.
“They’re quarantining the city,” Mr. Ocelot growled. “Trying to keep the zombies inside.”
“What about the living?” Annabel exclaimed. “There are still living people in the city. They’ll be trapped inside with them.”
“As the gas spreads and the zombies go about their hunt, there soon won’t be many living people left,” he told her.
“God,” she breathed. “It really will be Dead London. A city of the walking dead. Can we get any lower?”
The ship was circling near the wall, just outside the range of the wall’s gun turrets. Just then, the captain’s voice came through the speaking tube, distorted and tinny as it resonated from a little metal box in the top right corner of the lounge.
“Mr. Grimmer, to the Captain’s Nook, if you please.”
“Excuse me a moment,” said Mr. O. To Annabel, he added, “I’ll see about getting us lower.”
While he left to confer with the captain, Annabel remained intent on the window. She was staring at the men on the gun turrets. Their weapons were aimed at the zombies, but they weren’t firing. So long as the zombies could not reach them, they did not pose a threat, she supposed.

At last, they drew close enough to distinguish the shape of the gas masks that the men at the turrets were wearing. They were corvine in shape, the masks of plague doctors.
“Resurrectionists.”
Of course, while they could now see the Resurrectionists clearly, they too could be seen. The Resurrectionists turned their attention from the zombies to the airship. One of them—Annabel couldn’t make out which one—spoke, using some sort of device to project their voice. It sounded tinny and inhuman, like the Captain’s through the speaking tube.
“This city is under quarantine. No citizens are to leave without clearing inspection. By the order of the British Military, turn your airship around.”
She looked at Mr. Ocelot, but he was stoic and unreadable. She wasn’t sure if that was sang-froid or if he was just keeping his fears to himself. Mrs. Hatton, meanwhile, was fanning herself, her eyes wide.
“I could—” Mrs. Hatton started to say.
“This ship is filled with hydrogen,” Mr. Ocelot replied. “But let’s not panic. This ship is a dreadnaught.”
The Resurrectionist’s voice interrupted their thoughts, loud enough to hear even over the rumble of the ship’s engines.
“Again, this city is under quarantine. Turn your ship around. If you do not comply, it will be seen as a hostile act, and we will open fire upon your vessel.”
In reply, a voice came through the speaking tube again. It was Mr. O’s voice, however, not Captain Merrick’s.
“All hands on deck. Mr. Ocelot, if you would man the port side cannon. Miss Monday, the gatling gun is all yours. Mrs. Hatton, the starboard cannon has your name on it, if you would be so kind. Let’s blow these Resurrectionists to smithereens.”
Annabel shared a smile with Mrs. Hatton.
“That’s not a word I use very often. Smithereens,” Mr. O continued.
“It’s still on,” came the captain’s voice. “You’ve got to hit this button here, if you want to quit speaking through the tube.”
“This one?”
The airship shuddered and a series of metal panels raised, covering the windows.
“No.” The captain’s voice again. “That one’s for the shields. Look, just let me do it.”
There was an audible click, and then the voices cut off. Annabel headed for the door, and with Mr. Ocelot and Mrs. Hatton in her wake, she headed topside. Mr. O and Captain Merrick were standing in the Captain’s Nook at the bow of the airship. The Resurrectionists’ guns were aimed at the ship, but the shields had been raised. Hopefully that would be enough to stop their bullets from puncturing the ballonets.
As promised, a gatling gun stood front and center, a huge cannon on either side of the ship. Annabel settled into her station, closing her one eye against the fierce, cold wind. She’d never used a gun like this before, so she took a moment to examine it while the Resurrectionist guns rang out, pinging against the metal shields. The shields were flimsy protection at best, she realised. The metal was too thin to hold out for long, and there were gaping holes in their protective space.
It didn’t take her long to figure out how to work the gun. Once it was ready, she aimed with her mechanical eye, and began firing. She cackled wildly as the gun let loose an onslaught of bullets, and the Resurrectionist fell from his post, only to be seized by the zombies below.
“God bless you, Dr. Gatling!” she cried triumphantly.
Then she aimed the weapon at the next Resurrectionist and gave him the same fate as his friend. The Penny Dreadful shuddered as Mr. Ocelot fired his cannon, and again as Mrs. Hatton did the same. Mr. Ocelot’s cannonball missed its mark, sailing over the wall, but Mrs. Hatton’s struck home, utterly destroying one of the gun towers.
The Resurrectionists continued to fire back, while the zombies below cried out for flesh. And through it all, Annabel continued to aim and fire, laughing wildly each time a Resurrectionist fell victim to her onslaught. And when each of the turrets in their way stood unmanned, The Penny Dreadful lowered its shields, and continued on its way.</Text>

            <Text>“Have you no respect for the dead?” asked Miss Monday, glancing at Mr. O with annoyance carefully disguising the horror she felt, still, even as he closed and locked the door to the laboratory.
“The dead have no respect for the living,” he replied with a shrug, as if this were explanation enough for his indifference.
“In any case,” said Miss Monday, “I have to admit, you are not a fraud, as I might have suspected. Nor are you insane.”
“Well,” said Mr. O, making a seesawing motion with his hand, a playful smile on his face.
She almost laughed, in spite of the situation. Instead, she gave him a fleeting smile, and followed him along the hallway as he continued to lead the way.
“I must apologise,” said Mr. O, finally taking note of Miss Monday’s distress. “The creature within the laboratory was perhaps a poor choice for a a woman’s delicate sensibilities, but I must admit, I had come to think of you as being made of sterner stuff than the average woman. I hadn’t thought-”
She paused, making him halt to look back at her, as she defended her honour as a fearless adventuress. If looks could kill, a single look into Miss Monday’s one eye could have sent a man straight to hell.
“I’ve stared down the barrel of a rifle without so much as batting an eye. I’ve leapt onto a speeding train from the back of a horse without the slightest trepidation. I’ve been cornered by hardened criminals, armed with nothing but the clothes on my back and the boots on my feet, and barely broken a sweat,” she said. It was not a boast. It was a challenge. I dare you, call me a coward. “But that thing in the tank…”
She suppressed a shudder. “It’s not natural. It’s not even human.”
“It is the face of death,” said Mr. O, his voice weary, void of its usual arrogance. “I know. I’m sorry. I suppose I’ve simply grown accustomed to these creatures. I’d somewhat forgotten how dreadful they can be.”
Miss Monday shook her head. “I can’t imagine how you could forget something like that.”
He shrugged. “Well, I drink quite a lot,” he said.
She laughed in spite of herself. “I suppose that must help,” she said. “I could probably do with a drink myself.”
Mr. O nodded.
“The rest of the tour can wait,” he said, turning around and heading back toward his office. “What’s your poison?”</Text>

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>Jonathan hastened to keep pace with his friends, who had slipped between a pair of tall trees and slid down the muddy slope that led down to the river. His mother had warned him not to stray too far from the house, but Jonathan had never felt particularly inclined to listen to her, especially when doing so might interfere with an adventure.
It was raining, as it often was, so the slope was slick, but Jonathan could hear his friends’ voices ahead of him. He pushed off at the top of the hill and let his momentum carry him down. He took off running when he reached the bottom, though the ground was just as slick there as it had been along the slope, and more than once he nearly lost his balance and tumbled into the mud. His mother would be furious. His clothes were ruined.
The dots in the distance quickly resolved into the familiar shapes of his friends. Harry, the son of a butcher, who had earned a reputation for being somewhat of a bully and a tyrant. And James, whose father’s gruesome murder a few years after James’ birth had been the talk of the town for years, and who himself had become quite the clever pickpocket. Whether it was because of his father’s murder or some other cause, James hardly ever spoke a word, though Jonathan would often catch him in fits of laughter.
He had been warned to stay away from this pair. His mother called them common. She used other names to describe them too, some of them less kind. Urchins, vandals, ruffians, scoundrels. Whatever she called them, it only made Jonathan want to spend more time with them, knowing how it drove her mad. Jonathan was supposed to be upper class, but he found other upper class children tiresome.
At low tide the mud that lined the Thames was often tinted red by countless worms, which lived in the river. Harry, with a laugh, had bent down to scoop up a few handfuls of the reddened mud, unearthing dozens of these so-called blood worms, aptly named due to their reddish colour. Harry’s hands were coated in mud, some of which had slopped onto his trousers, not that anyone would notice the additional dirt. Harry lived in a constant state of filth. Blood worms wriggled in his hands.
“Disgusting,” said Jonathan. “What are they?”
“Noodles,” said Harry. With a laugh, he mimed eating them. Mud dripped from his hands, and some of the worms wriggled free and fell to the ground.
Jonathan’s stomach churned.
“I dare you to eat one,” said James, suddenly.
Jonathan and Harry both stared at him in silence. Harry recovered first. “Let John do it,” he said, holding out his hands to Jonathan.
James shrugged and looked at Jonathan.
His expression must have been one of horror, but they were staring at him expectantly. Jonathan never turned away from a dare. His mother would wring his neck, of course, but he wasn’t about to back down. He didn’t wish to get any more dirt on his trousers though, so he was careful as he leaned forward and looked at the blood worms in Harry’s outstretched hands. He picked out the smallest one.
“Alright,” he said, forcing a smile.
He lifted the worm above his head and opened his mouth. His stomach made a noise. James began giggling, while Henry started saying that he wasn’t going to do it, that he would chicken out.
The worm dangling above his head, Jonathan looked at him in annoyance. Mud dripped onto his cheek, and he wiped it away with the back of his hand.
“I’ll do it,” he said defiantly. He raised the worm above his mouth again, tilted his head back, and opened wide. “Down the hatch,” he said, and let the worm fall into his mouth.
It wriggled in his mouth, tasting mostly of dirt, but he forced himself to swallow.
It caught in his throat. Choking, he tried to cough it back up, but it was stuck there, somehow, balled up in his throat. Instinctively, his hands went to his throat, and he tried to force it back up.
His breath came out in wet gurgles. His lungs began to ache. His friends were becoming hazy blotches of light. Dizzily, he reached out his hands, but they moved away from him.</Text>

            <Title>A train whistled in the distance as</Title>
            <Text>A train whistled in the distance. Two cups of Earl Grey steamed on the table, rattling as the train rattled past. Roderick risked taking a sip, burnt his tongue, and returned the cup to the table, eyeing it like he would a dog that had bitten him. Roderick had invited Parson to tea under the pretense of simply killing time while waiting for Jonathan to arrive in Paris, but he had an ulterior motive. There was something he wanted to ask Parson. It was the same question that had caused two Resurrectionist women to chase Roderick across the city, kidnap his assistant and his dog, and to kill an innocent bystander just to get the answer. Perhaps they were right; if Roderick were to see the prison for himself, he might be able to figure it out on his own, but he had no wish to see Chateau d’If any time soon, especially if he could simply ask.
“How did you manage to escape?” Roderick asked.
Parson grinned. “I flew away, just as you said.”
Roderick scoffed. “Really, Parson, sometimes you’re more irritating than charming. Tell me, truly, how did you get away?”
Parson inclined his head, picked up his own cup of tea and drank from it. “Very well,” he said.
He began with his meeting with Jonathan Grimmer, three years ago, the day the Resurrectionists began their Dead London Project, spreading the virile Lazarus Virus throughout London. Roderick had heard this part from Jonathan before—Parson had been captured by Resurrectionists posing as policemen. The former Resurrectionist lab had contained a few cells for prisoners, and Parson had been taken there. This side of the story, Roderick had heard from Annabel, who’d been in the adjacent cell. Annabel managed to get out. Parson did not. He was drugged and taken to Chateau d’If, where he spent the next three years planning his escape.
He told Parson about a man he’d met in prison, a priest who became something of a mentor to Parson. It was the priest who gave Parson the idea for how he might escape, through a narrow gap in his door, through which the guards slid his plate of food each day. On the priest’s advice, he spent years improving his flexibility so that he might slip through the gap, learning the routines of the guards to avoid capture, and assembling the necessary supplies to get away.
In the end, it took three years before Parson was able to crawl, unnoticed, through the narrow slot in the door, arching his back and craning his neck like a contortionist to slide through. He had to do the same again to enter the priest’s cell.
He had promised to take the priest with him when he escaped, but he was forced to rescind his promise, as the priest had died, this being the catalyst that prompted Parson to finally attempt the escape he had been planning for three years.
“How did he die?” Roderick asked.
“He took ill,” Parson answered.
“And then?”
“I climbed through the window and jumped,” said Parson, taking another sip of his tea.
Roderick frowned. “From hundreds of feet in the air? Parson, be serious. What really happened? You know I’ll not rest until I have the answer.”
Parson’s lips curled. “You always were persistent,” he admitted. He smiled, flashing his bright green eyes at Roderick. For a moment, Roderick was certain that Parson was still not going to answer. He seemed to be considering something, chewing on his lower lip as he often did when he was deep in thought. Even after all this time apart, his mannerisms were still familiar to Roderick. Even so, Roderick did not delude himself that he knew all of Parson’s secrets. Most of his former lover’s secrets were a mystery, even to him, but that had never bothered him. As far as Roderick was concerned, the power of a secret came from keeping it.
At last, Parson ceased chewing on his lip, apparently having come to some decision. He removed his jacket, letting it fall onto the back of his chair, pealed off his gloves and put his bare hands on Roderick’s face. He stared into Roderick’s eyes, and beyond them, so that Roderick could almost feel his eyes touching the very depths of his soul.
Something danced at the edge of his vision like a wisp of steam, spreading out in a medicinal green as Parson Sinews’ eyes pierced deeper…
Deeper…
Deeper…
Light began to bend and warp strangely, to shimmer and vibrate, as if reality itself was shaking itself apart from its very foundations. It was is if he had fallen asleep and begun to dream.
As his vision of the world began to change, Roderick’s attention became fixated on Parson. There was something different about him, but it was difficult to place. Had he always had those greenish black wings at his back? Roderick wasn’t certain. Surely his smile had always been gleaming with shark-like teeth? Had that sheen of shimmering green light not always trailed behind him when he moved? Had he not always been at once hideous and beautiful to behold?
The longer Roderick stared at his once lover, the more he doubted that anything was different about him at all. He know that he had seen this side of Parson before, too. Yes, he was certain he had seen this side before. More than that, he knew that it was always there, just beyond the veil, if he could only see it as he did now.
It was as if he was now seeing the world as a drunk and that eventually, he would sober up again. With that sobriety would come memory loss. Black spots in his mind, evanescent traces of what he had seen and done while intoxicated that would shrink away and disappear when he tried to reach them.
Holding Roderick’s gaze with his eyes, Parson finally answered the question. How had he gotten out of prison? His answer was the same as he’d given earlier, only this time, Roderick believed him.
“I flew away.” His words were whispers, which crept under Roderick’s skin. “I drank the blood of the Mad Priest. Each day I drank from him until finally it killed him. After that, I knew I couldn’t stay any longer. Not without fresh blood to sustain me. I had been practicing every day, improving my flexibility and training myself for when the time came. Once I made it into the old man’s cell, I climbed out the window and jumped.”
Roderick shrank back, suddenly terrified of his company. “What are you?” he said, horrified by the revelation.
A crescent smile of sharp teeth answered him. “I am the green fairy. My robe is the color of despair,” Parson answered, reciting some poem with which Roderick was not familiar, its verses morbid and terrifying through Parson’s still-smiling lips. “I am ruin and sorrow. I am shame. I am dishonor. I am death. I am Absinthe.”
He shut his eyes, and just as quickly, the world returned to normal.
Roderick rubbed his aching head. “I’m sorry,” he said, disoriented and suddenly very tired. He tried to remember where their conversation had left off, and realized he must have let his mind wander. He had just asked Parson about his escape from Chateau d’If, but he could feel there was an icy tension between them. “I’m sorry,” he said again. “I didn’t mean to pry. Really, I’m just glad to have you back.”
He stood, feeling dizzy.
“I hate to end our tea so abruptly, but I’m afraid I’m not feeling myself just now. I believe I’ll head home and lie down for a bit, if you don’t mind. Sébastien will surely be getting jealous by now anyway; he doesn’t like me spending time with you, you know.”
Parson smirked. “Be sure to tell Sébastien he has nothing to worry about,” he said. “You’re perfectly safe in my company.”</Text>
            <Notes>Like a ghost in his peripheral vision, the haze slipped away whenever he tried to look it straight on. If he looked at just the right angle, keeping this other world in the edge of his eyes, he could see things as they really were.

He began to realize that this world, as he was seeing it now, was not the dream. He was only just waking up from the deep slumber of his ordinary life. He also knew that eventually he would fall back asleep and never realize that he was still dreaming.

Each time, he shrugged it off as a trick of the mind, or an effect of having taken too much of his beloved cocaine powder.

 His next bit of inspiration came from a novel, The Count of Monte Cristo.

In the novel, Parson explained, Edmond Dantès is able to escape after the Abbé Faria dies. When the guards stuff the priest’s body into a bag, intending to through the body into the sea, Dantès manages to hide in the bag, and later escapes by swimming to safety. Parson made his escape in a similar fashion.</Notes>

            <Synopsis>Mrs. Grimmer reveals her true colours, and shoots her son with a tranquilizer dart, again.</Synopsis>
            <Text>After Mrs. Grimmer had revealed her plan, and the Vigilance Committee had agreed to it, Jonathan found himself lingering once more at the door of the Moirae Tea House while the others filed out. As the others stepped outside, Jonathan waited until he and his mother were alone.
“A brief word?” he said.
“Of course,” said Mrs. Grimmer. “But do make it quick. We have a city to save.”
Although she was being serious, her tone was light, as if she was half-joking. It didn’t suit her, Jonathan thought. He frowned. “We might have had more time, if you’d thought to be honest with me from the beginning,” he said. “Or, for that matter, if you hadn’t shot me and Miss Monday with tranquilizers.”
“You’re upset with me,” she said, adopting his serious tone. “I can’t say I blame you. I did keep the truth from you, you’re right. But I did so to protect you.”
“Is that what you call it, protecting me?” Jonathan said, exasperated. “Well, a fat lot of good it’s done, this protection of yours.”
“You’re alive, aren’t you?” she said, quite seriously.
“Yes, but no thanks to you,” he replied.
She looked wounded.
He took a deep breath, forced himself to be calm. His relationship with his mother had always been like this. But he could see, from her perspective, how she might have thought she’d been protecting him by keeping the truth from him. Still, he wouldn’t put it past her to be aligned with the Resurrectionists and even now to be manipulating him. Just because she was his mother didn’t mean he could trust her. He decided to be direct.
“I overheard you speaking with someone; I now believe it was Mr. Palmer.”
“What did you hear?”
“Something about Miss Monday,” he said. “What about the woman? The thief?” He paused to recollect the rest of the conversation. “Then you mentioned that you needed to move the plan forward.”
If Mrs. Grimmer was surprised to have been overheard, she didn’t let on. She frowned, but with her, a frown hardly meant a thing. A smile was always more telling.
“Of course. The plan to stop Dead London,” she said.
She didn’t know how much Jonathan had overheard.
“You said that the antiserum is still unstable. You mentioned Dr. Allen’s failing health.” Jonathan protested. “What did you mean? What does Dr. Allen’s illness have to do with anything?”
Mrs. Grimmer looked down her nose at her son as if he were nothing more than an irritating pest, a mosquito.
“The first batch of the antiserum was derived from corvine birds, which possess a natural resistance to the virus. Not all animals do, you see. So crows became a subject of interest to the Resurrectionists involved in the Lazarus project. We believed, given their natural immunity, that they might allow us to synthesize an antiserum.”
“We? Us?” said Jonathan, pointing out her slip.
“Hush. Let me explain,” she said, brushing aside his interrogation. “Through his research, Dr. Allen became unintentionally exposed to the virus. Lazarus works in two stages. In stage one, the virus slowly kills the host body. It is only in stage two that the body becomes a zombie. As Dr. Allen was in stage one, he became useful as a test subject for the antiserum. If we could cure that stage of the virus, we could harness immortality; the virus would act only to keep the body alive after death, but without the other negative side effects: necrosis, rot, the primal urge to eat living flesh. The infected would not be zombies, but undead. With Dr. Allen, the antiserum actually showed promise. It worked to a point, preventing the virus from killing him, but it was still not a cure. Dr. Allen was dying; we were only delaying the inevitable. It was his belief that crows would not suffice to provide a cure. The cure had to come from humans. Humans who’d been exposed to Lazarus and survived.”
“Me and Miss Monday, you mean,” said Jonathan.
“I tried to persuade them to use only the thief, and to stay away from you. When you wandered straight into their facilities, that became problematic. Still, I managed to get you out of there, didn’t I?”
“You would have let them experiment on her? It could have killed her”
“Jonathan, she’s a criminal,” Mrs. Grimmer protested, but Jonathan was already backing away from his mother. He felt sick.
“They are on the verge of finding a cure for death itself,” she continued. “Who cares about the thief, with so much at stake?”
“You wanted this?”
“The Dead London Project is a bit extreme, even by my standards. I’d have preferred to have just used Miss Monday’s blood. Still, what’s a little bit of collateral damage in the scheme of things?”
“A little bit?” Jonathan scoffed. “Mother, they want to destroy London!”
Mrs. Grimmer rolled her eyes. “So small-minded, my son. You always were. Like your father. London is nothing with immortality at stake.”
“So what about your plan to stop them?” Jonathan asked, still stepping back.
“Oh, that was just meant to get you out of the way. You and your little Vigilance Committee have been meddling in the Resurrectionists’ affairs for far too long. I could have had you sent to Chateau d’If with Parson Sinews; perhaps I should have. I must be getting sentimental in my old age.”
“I can’t let you do this,” he said.
“You can’t stop me,” Mrs. Grimmer replied. And without further ado, she shot him with a tranquilizer dart, for the second time. Its effects were quick. Jonathan felt suddenly drowsy. His knees collapsed. He hit the ground.
He heard the chiming of bells. They sounded far away. His mother’s voice, muffled and indistinct. “Jonathan will catch up with us,” she said. “We are to begin without him.”
“Bitch,” Jonathan groaned as his eyelids grew as heavy as lead weights.</Text>

            <Title>Scene Three</Title>
            <Text>Mr. O’s office had an extra chair, which was not altogether uncomfortable. More importantly, he kept a small, locked cabinet, which contained a wide variety of half-finished bottles of liquor.
Miss Monday settled into her chair and tossed back a glass of brandy. Without a word, Mr. O leaned across the table and offered to refill her glass. She placed the glass down upon his desk and waited quietly as he poured her another, almost feeling the liquor settling her nerves. It was like fire in her veins, warming her from within.
“I have two questions,” she said, sipping her second glass of brandy.
“Just two?”
“More like two thousand, I suppose, but I’ll stick to two, for now,” she replied, cupping the glass of brandy in the palm of her hand.
Mr. O nodded, as he busied himself with pouring his own glass of liquor, preferring the anise-flavoured green faerie, as it was often called.
“Bit early for that, isn’t it?” she asked.
“Never,” he said, taking his first sip, then setting the glass down upon the desk. “But that’s not your first question, is it?”
She shook her head. “The unliving are real,” she said after a deep breath. “Much as I would like to continue to deny their existence, I cannot escape the truth. But here is my question. These creatures are dangerous. Cannibalistic, even, as you have said yourself. Why don’t you warn people about them, so that they may be better prepared to defend themselves?”
Taking another sip of absinthe, Mr. O swallowed, placed his glass back down, and replied, “I warned you.”
“But the general populace,” Miss Monday exclaimed, exasperated, “What about them? Are they to remain in ignorance, when these creatures are milling about the streets of London, looking for human flesh to consume? We are defenseless, naked, in our ignorance.”
Mr. O sighed, and it was perhaps the first time that Miss Monday had seen him looking weary. “That’s a question I’ve struggled with since I first began work at the Agency. The truth, though, is that as dangerous as the unliving may be, the knowledge of their existence may prove more dangerous still.”
“What do you mean?”
Mr. O leaned forward, placing his hands on the edge of his desk. “You’re a criminal, Miss Monday,” he said, “No offence intended. But being a member of the criminal underground, you must understand the importance of being dangerous.”
She nodded to say that she followed so far. Yes. In the world of criminals, the man with the biggest guns is king.
“Imagine,” said Mr. O, “How dangerous you might be, if you could bring monsters to life.”
Miss Monday shook her head. “I’m not sure I follow,” she said.
“Lazarus,” he explained, “It’s a disease. Or more accurately, a virus. Typically, it is spread by a bite from one of the infected dead; the virus is contained within their saliva and their blood. What this means is that hypothetically speaking, the disease could be extracted and administered like a drug, by a hypodermic needle, for example. It could even be distributed in the form of a gas and released into the very air we breathe, creating monsters wherever the wind takes it.”
Miss Monday took another sip of brandy, and settled back in her seat. She had been leaning forward, gripping the arms of her seat, her knuckles turning white.
“And you want to tell people about this?” Mr. O demanded with more passion than she’d grown accustomed to hearing from him.
She stared at him in quiet horror as she contemplated what he was saying. If he was right, if this disease really could be spread as easily as he’d described, then there really was no choice but to keep it secret.
“And yet you’re telling me,” she said, after a few moments of quiet contemplation had passed while they’d sipped their liquor in silence. “Dangerous criminal that I am?”
“Is that your second question?” he asked. “You’re not a criminal any more. You’re an Agent. A hunter of the unliving. At least, that is my hope.”
Miss Monday bit her lip. She wanted to tell him that he was full of horse shit. But he had made good on his promise. He had removed all doubt of the existence of the unliving. Which gave Mr. O much more credit than Miss Monday cared to afford him.
Still, it was evident that Lord Connor really had hunted the unliving. Whoever killed him had knowledge of the Lazarus Virus, and knew how to use it as a weapon. And if Mr. O’s suspicions were correct—that Connor had been a member of the Resurrectionists, then it was possible they’d killed him for attempting to leave. Or for attempting to keep whatever was in the safe from them.
Mr. O gestured toward Miss Monday’s picnic basket, which sat upon his desk. “But all that is just speculation. You have the answer to your question right there,” he said. “You only have to open it.”
She shook her head.
“Still won’t open it?”
“I’m not sure,” she said. “I need to think.”
Mr. O sat back in his seat and nodded. “Stubborn, aren’t you?” he said.
“I’ve been called worse.” She settled back in her chair, her eyes still fixed on the picnic basket. “No,” she said, leaning forward and grabbing the basket off the table, “Never mind. I need to know. If you’re wrong about this, I’ll simply reseal the envelope and deliver it as promised.”
She withdrew the envelope from within the picnic basket. A thick yellow envelope, not terribly heavy, the package was sealed with red wax. It was embossed with the stag’s head of Connor’s family crest. Mr. O slid a letter opener across the table. She picked it up and slit the envelope open.
“Moment of truth,” she said.
Then she reached into the envelope and began to pull out its contents. Sheets of torn-up paper, blank.</Text>

            <Title>Scene 39</Title>
            <Synopsis>Annabel meets Dr. Jekyll, but convinces him she’s a Resurrectionist. Eventually, he realizes who she is, and pricks her neck and knocks her unconscious.</Synopsis>
            <Text> The tank was filled to the top with dark, murky water, completely sealed to prevent the creature within from escaping. Pressed against the glass was a set of lifeless, rotten fingers.
The skin on those rough hands had begun to slough off and reveal a set of yellowed bones. The zombie’s naked, sinewy flesh had slowly begun to rot and fall away, filling the tank with drifting bits of rotten meat, a macabre snow globe. Within a ribcage bare of flesh, was a heart turned black and grey by rot. Un-beating.
But it was the creature’s face which truly filled Annabel with unshakable terror, and from which she could not tear away her gaze.
Its jaws, still gnashing, its yellowing teeth—many of which lay on the floor of the tank, leaving only a few, randomly placed in its mouth—ground against the glass walls as if to gnaw its way free. The zombie stared at Annabel through the glass.
She could see her own face, reflected in the glass, and knew that her expression was one of utter horror. But still, she stepped closer to the tank, looking in amazement and repulsion at the once-human thing that swam within the confines of its glass prison.
Its nose, decomposed so thoroughly that Annabel could see the wretched creature’s skull through its nostrils. Its ears, tattered and torn like scraps of old cloth. And its eyes, its dreadful eyes. White and lifeless, unblinking, as the creature moved its head to stare alternately at Annabel.
Suddenly, she saw another face, reflected in the glass. She whirled around. It was an old man, bespectacled, dressed in a lab coat, leaning heavily on his cane. He emerged from a door at the back of the room. She’d been so taken in by the creature in the tank that she hadn’t even seen the door until just that moment. She relaxed slightly. He didn’t seem like much of a threat, but her hand still hovered at her gun belt.
Seeming not to notice Annabel’s wariness, he flashed her a smile and busied himself with his work, entirely ignoring her. After a while, he looked up, and seemed to notice for the first time that she was still there.
“What is it?” she asked, looking back and forth between the zombie in the tank and the old man.
“It’s an experiment,” he said.
She turned back to the tank. Her skin crawled.
“An experiment?” she repeated, horrified, but managing to keep her voice calm.
“We wanted to see if they could breathe underwater,” he explained.
“And?” she asked
“And it turns out they don’t need to breathe,” he said. “To clarify, most of them do breathe, but I suspect that’s out of force of habit, rather than necessity. After all, they were human once, and breathing is part of human nature.”
“So, they do retain some aspects of their human nature?” she concluded.
She stepped back as the thing inside the tank moved its head and looked at her, unblinking.
Annabel shook her head in disgust as she forced herself to look away from the hideous creature in the tank. This creature had once been a man, a living man. It was pitiable, really, but she could not bring herself to feel pity. All she could feel, even as she turned away to stare at the scientist, was dread.
“This isn’t the first one I’ve seen,” she told him. Her voice was quiet, lacking its usual tone of confidence and danger. There was fear in her voice, and she knew it, the moment the words tumbled out of her mouth. She forced herself to swallow the fear, to get control of herself. Her hands were sweating. She could feel the zombie’s eyes on her.
The scientist was staring at her, waiting for an explanation.
“Lord Henry Connor,” she said, keeping her voice firm, steady. “Among others.”
The scientist nodded.
“Ah, yes, Lord Connor,” he said. “So, you were one of those sent to the masquerade, yes?”
Annabel nodded. Best to go along with it, she thought.
“He was one of us, you know.”
“A Resurrectionist?” said Annabel.
The scientist nodded again, both confirming what she had suspected about Lord Connor, and confirming that this was a Resurrectionist hideout. Just as she thought. At least the scientist seemed to think Annabel was one of them. As long as she could maintain that illusion, she might get out of here alive.
“Do you know why Connor was turned into one of…these?” she asked, pointing at the creature in the dank water. She noticed that he was right about the creature. It wasn’t breathing.
A dark look crossed over the old man’s face. “Anthony Tidkins,” he muttered, almost under his breath. “Before he came along, we were free to pursue whatever scientific interests caught our fancy. Now, we do what Anthony says. Anyone who crosses him…”
“Right,” she said, as if this wasn’t news to her, but her mind was spinning.
Lord Connor had betrayed Tidkins. Annabel considered the package she’d taken from Connor’s safe. The vial of Lazarus. The Resurrectionists had arranged for Annabel to steal it; Connor’s betrayal, she thought, was that he’d refused to give the virus to the Resurrectionists. For his betrayal, Tidkins had killed him. No, not killed, she realized. Connor had been turned into a zombie. Her brow furrowed. If Tidkins had infected Connor with Lazarus, that meant he already had access to the virus. Why did he need to steal it from Connor’s safe?
“What’s your field of study?” asked the scientist. “I haven’t seen you down here before.”
Annabel tensed. She knew nothing about science, but she couldn’t afford to give herself up. She took a stab at it, latching on to something he’d said earlier.
“Oh, well, I used to be an anatomist,” she said. “Only now…”
The old man sniffed.
“Now you study the unliving,” he finished. He walked around from behind his desk, hobbling a bit on his cane. “I was a surgeon.”
Annabel smiled tightly. A surgeon would certainly know plenty about anatomy. Hopefully he didn’t ask too many questions.
“Dr. Henry Jekyll,” he said, holding out his hand. She shook it. “Firm grip you have, Doctor…?”
She noticed his use of an alias. She remembered that the Resurrectionists took their names from literature, from penny bloods and Newgate novels. This wasn’t exactly common knowledge, but Annabel had once lived in the home of Anthony Tidkins, the most famous of the Resurrectionists. She knew a few of their secrets.
“Dr. Musidora Sinclair,” she answered.
Dr. Jekyll nodded his approval. Apparently Annabel had passed the test. Musidora Sinclair was from The Necromancer. Annabel thought it appropriate, considering the Resurrectionists were supposed to be raising the dead.
“So what are these things exactly?” she asked, tapping her fingers on the glass.
“Fascinating specimen, isn’t it?” Dr. Jekyll replied, excitedly hobbling over on his cane.
He was staring into the tank now, too, but his expression was not one of horror. He was fascinated.
“They’re infected,” he said at last, turning away from the zombie to look at Annabel. “It’s a sickness. And a rather unpredictable one at that. From what we can tell, it’s passed from one victim to another via bodily fluids: blood, saliva, and so forth. Once infected, the victim quickly begins to die. But it is in death that the disease truly takes its toll. After death sets in, he wakes up. It’s called—”
“The Lazarus Virus,” Annabel finished.
“That’s right,” the scientist confirmed. He offered her a broad smile. “So you do know a bit about it already?”
Annabel nodded. “I know they’re dangerous,” she said. “And I know the infection is spreading throughout the city. There was a vial of green liquid—”
“Ah yes!” Dr. Jekyll exclaimed, “Yes, Francis Varney’s contribution to the Dead London Project. See, we had already managed to replicate the virus, and we were able to spread it via injection. Varney’s solution was a bit neater, of course. The green liquid you mentioned, a solution containing the Lazarus Virus, is easily converted into a gaseous form. This gas, once inhaled, causes infection.” Jekyll smiled. “Very effective, especially when combined with Anthony Tidkins’ mechanical ravens.”
Annabel forced a smile, and gave him a quick nod. 
“But why?” she asked. “Why spread the virus at all?”
Jekyll frowned, and tilted his head. His bushy eyebrows narrowed suspiciously. “You mean you don’t know?”
Annabel shook her head.
Dr. Jekyll decided to take pity on her. He patted her shoulder. “Dr. Sinclair,” he said grandly, “We’re trying to cure death.”
He narrowed his eyes and focused on the zombie in the tank. He waved a finger in front of the glass and watched, fascinated, as the zombie tracked his movement with its dead eyes. He seemed to forget that Annabel was still there, he seemed so lost in his fascination with the thing in the tank. Annabel felt revolted, yet Dr. Jekyll seemed to have answers. And Annabel still had questions.
“Anthony Tidkins believes that somewhere, in this vast city, someone will be exposed to the virus and not become one of these creatures.” He tapped the glass, and the zombie snapped its teeth ineffectively against the glass. “He believes that the human race is resilient, that we may be naturally immune to some viruses. If just one person proved to be immune to Lazarus, their blood might be used to create a cure.”
Annabel gasped. So they were working on a cure. They didn’t have it yet, but there was still a chance to save the city.
“So you spread the disease just to find a cure for it? That’s insane.”
“Cure Lazarus, cure death,” he said simply. He stared into the dark glass tank, Annabel’s face and his staring back at him in the reflection. “Lazarus isn’t an ordinary disease,” he elaborated.
Annabel snorted dismissively. Clearly, she thought.
“For the infected, death is a metamorphic process, transforming them from humans into predatory beasts. They do not speak, they do not think. Indeed, they do not seem to possess any sort of capacity for reason or logic. They act only on their predatory instincts and their incredible hunger. And of course, they eat the living.” He paused, coughed violently into his handkerchief, staining it red with blood. He cleared his throat and continued as if nothing had happened. “But while their bodies are decaying, these creatures have effectively evaded death. They cannot be killed, except by a severe blow to the brain; they will live forever.”
“You call this a life?” she said, meaningfully indicating the moldering creature that floated before them, hungrily grasping at them through the glass. Again and again, it struck its hands against the glass. Like a bird flying into a window, it didn’t seem to understand that it couldn’t pass through the glass.
“You’re right, of course. But if there was a cure…” he said, trailing off. He coughed again, hacking up blood. When he was finished coughing, he said with renewed energy, his eyes alight with passion. “Suppose we could eliminate the side effects—the cannibalistic instincts, the rotting flesh, the loss of intelligence—while leaving the benefits of the metamorphosis—eternal life.”
“You think that’s possible?” Annabel asked.
Turning away from the glass tank, he fixed his eyes on Annabel, and seemed to notice her brass eye for the first time. He narrowed his eyes.
“What do you think?” he asked, coldly.
“I’m not sure,” she said, nervous but managing to keep her voice even.
“Speculate.”
Annabel’s mouth became dry. She suddenly felt cold. She forced a smile and a laugh.
Her hand drifted to her gun belt. She would shoot this old man here and now if she had to, but she worried the gunshot would draw more Resurrectionists. Better to talk her way out of this if she could.
“Yes, I suppose it’s possible,” she said.
After a moment of tense silence, as the scientist stared at her clockwork eye, narrowing his eyes and studying her, he clapped his hands together, startling her.
“Well,” he said, “That settles it then. There’s someone who’s very anxious to meet you.”
Annabel felt a cold sweat running down her back. He knew who she was, she was sure of it.
She reached for her gun, but before she had a chance to draw it, she felt something sharp and cold pierce her skin. A prick, like a mosquito bite. She felt cold, and then numb, and then incredibly tired. It became hard to see, and difficult to hear, and then everything went black.</Text>
            <Comments>Later, Annabel needs to learn that Varney is Lord Connor
Removed:
That explained it. The Resurrectionists already had the virus when they hired her to break into Connor’s safe; what they didn’t have was a means of distributing it. Lord Connor’s solution, combined with Anthony Tidkins’ clockwork bird, made it easy for the Resurrectionists to spread the virus. And Annabel had helped them. She felt sick.</Comments>
            <Notes> “An appropriate name, don’t you think? After all, it is a resurrection virus. It has the power to bring living creatures back to life. Unfortunately, there are side effects, as you can surely tell. These creatures aren’t like you or me.”
“In what way?” Annabel asked, taking her eyes off the creature. Still, as she turned away from it, she could feel its dead eyes on her, watching her.
“For the infected, death is a metamorphic process, transforming them from humans into predatory beasts. They do not speak, they do not think.

            <Text>She thought immediately of the Resurrectionists and their plague masks. When Annabel was a little girl, an orphan on the streets, stealing from men’s pockets, one of her victims had been a rich gentleman.
Although she’d gotten away with his coin purse, she had the distinct feeling he’d let her get away. The next time she met him, he’d come to her rescue, after she’d been caught red-handed stealing. After that, they’d become thick as, well, thieves. In fact, there was a time when Annabel had thought of him as her brother.
He had often worn an old, weathered plague mask. At the time, she didn’t know what the mask was for. Now that she did, she felt sickened by the memory.</Text>

            <Title>Scene Two</Title>
            <Text>There was a man with a bird’s face standing at the side of his bed. Behind him, a pale white boy with blonde hair, about his own age or perhaps a few years younger, stood against the wall, looking shyly back. Jonathan offered up a smile, but the boy cowered and looked away.
He leaned back on his pillow and looked up at the man with the bird’s face. His face was made of dark leather, and it was strapped to his head with shiny brass buckles. He had glass lenses for eyes. A doctor, he realised. He’d seen pictures in books of doctors who would wear this style of mask in the times of the plague, although he never knew doctors still wore them.
He tried to sit up but the doctor pressed a gloved hand against his chest and forced him back down. He was cold, feverishly cold, beneath the blankets. His bare chest was covered in sweat The doctor had a thermometer in his hand, but apparently he was done with examining it, so he placed it on the bedside table.
Jonathan wanted to ask him what was happening, but his own voice sounded strange to him. Incoherent. Slurred. He had a vague recollection of choking on something. The blood worm. He remembered gradually losing consciousness, and he remembered the frightened faces of his friends as they turned and ran.
He tried to sit up again, but was stopped once more by the doctor’s hand.
“Restrain him,” said the doctor. His voice sounded strange, too, filtered through the leather plague mask, but a moment later a servant entered the room with a set of leather straps in hand.
Forgetting that the doctor’s hand was still pressed hard against his chest, Jonathan tried again to sit up, and when he met the resistance of the doctor’s hand, he grew more desperate in his need to sit. He grabbed at the doctor’s hand with his own, tried to pry his arm from his chest, but he was like an ant trying to force an elephant to budge.
While the doctor pinned him down, the servant began to tie the straps around him, binding him in bed. Three straps, one around his waist, one around his legs, and now the servant moved to tie one around his chest. He snarled, and the girl stepped back in horror.
She took a moment to catch her breath, which he’d startled out of her. When she recovered, she moved back to buckle the straps in place. She had to move in close in order to get them done up tight. She smelled like meat.
He hadn’t realised how hungry he was, but the smell of her reminded him somehow of the smell of fresh meat. Her hands worked quickly, and she was almost finished with the buckle.
Jonathan sat up, pushing through the resistance from the doctor’s hand. The doctor stumbled backward, caught by surprise and knocked off balance. But the serving girl was too slow in her reaction. So Jonathan sunk his teeth into her throat and clamped down. Blood spurted into his mouth as his teeth scraped through skin and dug into the meat in her neck.
She was screaming, pressing down on her neck with both hands and stumbling about in confusion. The little boy standing behind the doctor was screaming, tears streaking down his face. Jonathan’s mother came bounding into the room, and when she took one look at Jonathan, strapped to the bed and chewing on the flesh of a serving girl, she started screaming too. But Jonathan had meat in his mouth, and it was warm and sweet. And he was smiling.</Text>

            <Title>Kasumi imagined that, in a way, planning a monster hunt was little different from planning a heist</Title>
            <Text>Kasumi imagined that, in a way, planning a monster hunt was little different from planning a heist. She knew that Annabel Grey had planned many. Kas had a great deal of respect for the infamous thief, and had seen her in action many times. She listened attentively to Annabel’s plan, and set her jaw in a firm line when Annabel turned to Kas and explained her part.
“Timing is crucial,” Annabel said, speaking rapidly as she revealed the plan. “Even as we speak, that thing is still running rampant, leaving ruins in its wake. Do you think you can manage what I’m asking?”
Kas tucked her wrench into her tool belt and put a hand on the hilt of her sword. Her eyes gleamed, fierce and determined. She nodded. “You can count on me.”
“Ollie?” Annabel said, not wasting a moment.
“This ole girl isn’t exactly in ship shape. We’ve got a punctured ballonet and structural damage. I’m amazed we’re still floating at all.”
“I understand that,” Annabel replied, “but that doesn’t answer my question.”
“Yes,” the pilot answered at last. “We’ll manage it.”
Jonathan, Henri-Charles, and Dr. Sound said the same. They’d get it done.
Without another word, they got to work.
Kas could hear Ollie starting to shout orders to the crew, his voice so commanding she figured he didn’t even need the speaking tubes. Meanwhile, she stripped off her engineering belt and left it in the crew cabin. She followed Henri-Charles out onto the deck, where he set about tying the lines around her waist.
When he was done, she drew her katana. Quickly, with the skill of a practiced swordswoman, she sharpened and polished it. She raised the sword and listened to it sing as it sliced through the air.
“Where did you learn to do that?” asked Henri-Charles.
“From my mother,” Kas explained. “And she learned from watching my father, who was an expert in Niten Ichi Ryu and a Shinsengumi officer—a member of a police task force formed to protect the Shogunate. He was also a spy.”
Henri-Charles nodded in appreciation as Kasumi practiced with the sword, preparing for what she was about to do. The sword carved through the air, her movement so precise she might have made the sky bleed as she slashed with sharp steel. She felt the rumble of the engines as they chased down the enormous insect, and shifted her feet as the deck swayed. Her blade arced, folded steel glinting in the sunlight.
“My mother grew up revering the onna-bugeishas—female martial artists—and although women don’t commonly learn the sword any more,” Kas continued, her eye fixed on the cockroach as they drew closer, sneaking up from behind the insect with more speed than stealth, “my mother took her learning upon herself. She learned from my father’s example, even without his knowledge. She began to practice Nito Ryu, a classical style of swordsmanship, and when I was old enough, she began to teach me. One day, my father caught me using his sword. At first, he was furious. When he saw my skill with a sword, however, he promised to finish training me himself.”
She turned back to Henri-Charles. “I’m ready,” she said.
She signaled to Ollie, who slowed the ship to match the pace of the flying insect. She slipped her welding goggles over her eyes and tightened the leather strap. Setting her jaw, she stepped over the ship’s ledge and fell through the air.
The rope unspooled, stretching out behind her, as the bitter wind stung her cheeks. The rope began to go taut as she neared the end of its length; at the same time, she came out of the dive in order to land on the beast’s back. She drove the blade into its shell as she landed, and clung to the blade for balance.
The Penny Dreadful continued to match her pace to allow her enough rope that she wouldn’t be yanked off before her work was done, but the creature wailed in rage as she drove the sword into it and it tried to shake her free. Even if she did fall, the rope around her waist would keep her from plummeting to the ground below. She concentrated on what she needed to do.
Steel scraped against chitin as she pulled the blade free. Standing precariously on the edge of the monster’s back, she swung the sword, and in one quick motion, carved off both wings. The creature’s wail was shrill, and painfully loud. It dropped out of the sky just as quickly, and suddenly, Kas was swinging from the rope, dangling a hundred feet above the earth, suspended from the airship.
The earth spun dizzyingly below, the rope jerking and swinging her violently. She clutched her sword tight, scared she was going to end up slicing her own fingers off or stabbing herself. She swung back and forth in long arcs, her body completely horizontal as she struggled to regain her balance. She watched the monster’s antennae whip past and heard the thunderous crash of the monster hitting the earth.
She continued to swing, spreading her arms in a desperate bid to regain her balance. She heard the snapping of twine, and knew she’d inadvertently hit the rope with her blade. When the rope jerked again, the last thread snapped, and she fell.
The ground rose up to meet her. Her stomach lurched, and her ears popped from the pressure. Her heart slammed into her chest. Her final thoughts were of her mother and father, and of the sacrifices they’d made to get her here. Even now, she was grateful to them for everything. Then she slammed into the the ground with a sickening crunch of flesh, and everything went dark.
She felt wet. Her entire body hurt, and she couldn’t see a thing. There was a thick layer of slime or mucous covering her eyes, but she was alive. Against all odds, she’d landed on the giant zombie bug, and its thick layers of rotten flesh had actually broken her fall.
She kept her eyes and mouth shut, afraid to swallow any of the creature’s nasty bodily fluids for fear of infection. She wiggled her left arm experimentally, and cried out in pain. Broken. She tried her right, and pain shot through her, right up to her shoulder. But she could move it. She tightened her fingers around her sword, miraculously still in her hand, and began to carve her way free.
She was inside the belly of the beast.
Her blade slashed through rotten flesh and thick layers of chitin, hacking a path through the monster like an adventurer hacking at vines with a machete. She didn’t want to die like this. Desperately she hacked away, too scared to open her eyes or even breathe as she fought her way free, because infection would be worse than death.
She heard an explosive sound, felt the rumble of the blast and a sudden wave of heat, and heard the monster’s hideous screech. Just as suddenly, the creature went silent, and stopped moving. She kept going, until her sword met open air.
She put her hand outside and felt the breeze. She let her sword clatter to the ground, and wiped her eyes and face. Finally, exhausted, she breathed. Like a newborn babe, she crawled—dripping wet and desperate for air—from the monstrous womb, and staggered onto the ground.
She felt her vision blurring, and her head aching. A dozen hands supported her, one of them cold and metallic. She looked into Annabel’s eyes and offered a weak smile.
“It’s dead,” she heard Annabel say.
She closed her eyes and lay still.</Text>

The first half of the second act is where your characters find the time and space to react to the first major plot point. The first major plot point is going to hit your character hard. His life is no longer running on the same smooth path it always has, and he has to do something about it. If we look long and hard at the first major turning point in a book, we realize that it’s actually the character’s reaction to the event that changes everything and creates our story.

Annabel reacts to learning that Jack Bernhardt is Anthony Tidkins. She wants to find him, and she wants to get back what she stole from Connor’s safe.

Jonathan reacts to the knowledge that the Resurrectionists may have killed his father and the knowledge that they have unleashed a zombie virus upon the city.

Roderick reacts to the city being overtaken by zombies</Synopsis>

            <Title>Scene 22</Title>
            <Synopsis>Roderick tries to fend off the zombies.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Roderick had already fired three of the little six-shooter’s bullets. Each bullet had hit its mark, leaving a gaping wound through the policeman’s heart. Each bullet should have killed him, but Nichols was already dead. Roderick had checked the man for a pulse and had felt nothing. The man’s flesh was already beginning to rot, though he’d been dead only a minute and though he was still walking. Something was keeping Nichols on his toes, but it wasn’t blood pumping through his veins.
Roderick stumbled backward as Nichols lunged forward with a staggering gait. Roderick hit the floor, landing hard on his back, while Nichols crawled after him, spittle and drool falling from his rotting lips. Roderick felt a cold hand on his leg, its grasp tight, threatening to tear through the fabric of his trousers and dig into his skin.
The sounds the creature was making were unnatural. Rasping, wheezing, predatory snarls and growls, not quite human, not quite animal. The sound of breath flowing through dead lungs. His teeth snapped, aiming for Roderick’s hand. Roderick just barely managed to avoid being bitten.
Suddenly, violently, there was a sickening crunch, the hard hammer of a billy club striking the dead man’s skull. It exploded in a spray of rancid blood and brain. The tight grip on Roderick’s leg relaxed, and Nichols fell face-first onto Roderick’s chest. Roderick yelped.
“Get him off me,” he whined, “Get him off! Get him off!”
As Taggert wiped the blood from his baton on his trousers, the other policemen helped Roderick to drag the now unmoving body off him.
“Thank you,” he said, addressing the policeman with a moustache, who had offered a hand to help Roderick to his feet. “Detective Inspector,” he said to Taggert.
“What is it?”
Roderick was looking at Nichols, his skull caved in by the Inspector’s heavy blow to the head, and at the ceiling, a bullet hole in the plaster. He couldn’t say this with certainty, but judging from the angle, he believed that whoever shot Lord Connor had been lying on the floor with Connor pinned on top of him. Again, he couldn’t be certain, but he imagined Connor had been shot in the head. He looked back to Nichols, contemplating the holes he’d put in the man’s chest, which had done nothing at all to stop him. It had taken a blow to the head to put him down, just—he suspected—as it had with Connor.
“I believe I know what happened to Lord Connor,” he muttered, almost to himself.
“Roderick?” said Taggert.
“Never mind. Inspector, I’ve come to understand something about these dogs scratching at our door, and it is imperative that you understand it as well. I was wrong about one thing. They do not merely seem dead. They are dead.”
“What?” spluttered the other policeman, a tall, bulky man with greasy black hair and a dark complexion. “How can they be dead if they are still walking? What are they?”
“I’m not sure. Vampires?” Roderick posited.
Then, recalling a conversation he’d once had with Parson Sinews, he thought of another word that seemed to fit. Sinews had once told him a story about the dead being brought back to life by vodou sorcerers. The resurrected dead in Sinews’ stories weren’t truly dead, but poisoned. Still, the dead outside the door reminded Roderick of them. Mindless husks of their former selves, the dead brought back to life by vodou were called zombies. The dead that were sitting outside, banging at the door without any hint of the civility they’d had in life, they were no different. This affliction had robbed them of their capacity for rational thought.
“No,” he said. “Not vampires. Zombies.”
He looked at Nichols’ unmoving corpse. The bullets he’d put in Nichols’ chest hadn’t killed him. “Ordinary means may not kill them. Aim for their heads.”
“Zombies?” Taggert repeated. Even if he was unfamiliar with the word, he seemed to grasp the way that Roderick had meant it. It was a dehumanizing word. Roderick meant that these men were no longer men, but monsters. Taggert gaped at Roderick, wide-eyed and frightened. “Are you mad, Steen?”
Roderick answered by reloading his pistol and aiming it at the door that was splintering under the pressure of the creatures outside, slamming their bodies and fists against the wall until it threatened to cave in.
“It took all three of us just to deal with one of them,” Roderick said, gesturing at the dead policeman. “How many, do you think, are on the other side of that door, Detective?”
“Hundreds.”
“I concur. And I think, unless you have some idea of how to deal with this situation, that you had better trust me.”
Roderick could understand Taggert’s hesitation. This was a political nightmare. The zombies outside had been ministers, barons and baronesses, military figures, all of them Taggert’s societal betters. If it turned out that they could have been cured of their affliction and Taggert had killed them, to say that it would be career-ending would be an understatement of vast proportions.
“Your life is at stake,” Roderick reminded him.
His words were drowned out as the door finally gave in, the barricade toppled over, and the dead came spilling into the room.
In top hats and cravats, in bustle skirts and corsets, with silk ribbons in their hair and gloves on their hands, a hundred dead aristocrats shuffled forward, spluttering and moaning as they gnashed their quickly rotting teeth.
Roderick opened fire, squinting as he took aim at the closest of them, and put the creature down. A bullet through the skull, the first of the zombies hit the floor. The undead mob kept coming, stumbling over their fallen comrade as Roderick turned to the next closest creature and aimed his gun.
Finally, the policemen understood. At least, so Roderick assumed, as their gunshots joined Roderick’s own, and the zombies fell in quick succession. Still, the creatures were pouring through the doorway more quickly than Roderick and the policemen could put them down. Already, Roderick’s gun chamber was empty. He fished through his pockets for more bullets, found them, and swung the chamber open.
In those few moments, a dozen more of the dead had hurled themselves over the broken doorway and fallen barricade and tumbled into the room. They crawled, staggered, and shuffled forward. Roderick resumed firing into the crowd but they were coming so quickly now, he barely had time to aim.
He retreated further into the room, backing his way towards the far wall as he emptied his chamber yet again. He reached for more bullets and found that only three remained.
“Inspector!” he shouted, fumbling to reload, “How fares your supply of ammunition?”
He finished reloading and emptied the gun a moment later, the dead landing just a few feet from where he stood. Still, the dead were flooding into the room as if there numbers were unlimited.
The din of gunshots quieted until all that could be heard was the snarling, growling of the shambling dead. Taggert holstered his gun.
“I’m out,” he said.</Text>
            <Comments>Hand?  I thought he had his leg.  Did Roderick reach down?
maintain consistency - either dry, powdery blood or “wet,” sticky blood
Where did Connor's body come from? They couldn't find it earlier?

I hope they have enough bullets!</Comments>

            <Title>The moment the woman saw that she’d been noticed, she</Title>
            <Text>The moment the woman saw that she’d been noticed, she gave up trying to be stealthy. She broke into a run, tearing across the street and heading for the alley. She was fast, her long legs lithe and muscular.
“Run!” Roderick cried, scooping up Bailey in his arms and taking off at a sprint. Sébastien followed, still hauling the suitcase behind him.
Roderick stopped to unhook Bailey’s collar and set the dog free. Then he snatched the suitcase from his assistant, opened it in one quick motion, and let the paint canisters tumble onto the ground. He dropped the case, grabbed his wide-eyed assistant, and took off running again. He risked a glance over his shoulder and saw a blur in his peripheral as the woman leapt over the paint cans. A moment later, she leapt over the suitcase. They’d barely slowed her down.
“Keep going,” Roderick urged. “This way.”
The alley opened onto Rue Tiquetonne. Roderick had a map of Paris etched in his mind, and this was his only weapon in this chase. The street was bustling with a flurry of activity, and Roderick weaved his way through it. He pushed his way through a crowd gathered in front of the florist’s shop, and dashed through the front door of a café. He pushed past the waitress, weaved through the tables, and shoved open the back door with a jangle of bells. Bailey yipped and scampered through the door, Sébastien shouting apologies in French as he followed.
Roderick craned his neck to see the woman still following. He watched in horror as she put a knife in the neck of someone barring her path. Roderick’s blood went cold. Her blade punctured the man’s throat with scientific precision, and his face froze in a horrific death mask as blood spurted from his wound. The woman stepped over his body, clutching the bloody blade, and headed to the door. Roderick heard screams from behind him as he ran across the next street.
Even amidst the crowd, it was clear she wouldn’t hesitate to put a knife in his back if she caught him. He pressed on, dragging Sébastien away from the scene.
He didn’t stop to wonder what this woman wanted with him. She was a Resurrectionist. That much was clear. He’d always known they’d find him eventually. After all, he’d helped infiltrate the Resurrectionist base of operations in the Old Albion Theater. He’d known they’d come after him. He just hadn’t thought they would find him this soon.
“Come on!” he shouted, and finally, Sébastien understood the urgency of their situation. Roderick could see him matching his pace, out of the corner of his eye. “This way!”
Again, he tried to lose her in an alley. His lungs burned, but there was no stopping now. He’d hoped to lose her as he ducked into an alcove, but another glance over his shoulder told him that the woman still had them in her sights. There was no hiding. All they could do was run.
His feet pounded on the cobblestones. Still the woman gained.
Roderick was tall and lanky, but he rarely exercised. He couldn’t keep this up for long, but he was more worried about Sébastien, who was already falling behind. He grabbed his assistant by the hand and hurried him around the corner. They collided with a man on a bicycle. The cyclist cursed, falling from the vehicle and skidding on the pavement. He stood up, swearing, his clothes torn.
Roderick simply stepped up to him, tightened his hand into a fist, and cocked him in the eye. He grabbed the bicycle, told Sébastien to get on it, and put Bailey in the basket. Already, the woman had caught up. “Go!” he shouted at Sébastien. “Save yourself! Don’t worry about me!”
The woman grabbed him by the wrist, drew her knife and pointed it at Roderick’s throat, but Roderick was ready. He flicked the knife away with his cane, surprising her. Roderick didn’t look like the sort of man who could defend himself, but he had trained in bartitsu. Taking advantage of her surprise, he followed up with a brutal crack of the cane, and she fell to her knees.
He pulled off the cap of the cane and drew the sword he had sheathed within it. Roderick lunged, and the woman went on the defensive. He had her now that he’d disarmed her. Shouldn’t have bothered running, he thought, thrusting with the sword. Suddenly, he felt a pair of strong arms at his neck, choking him.
“Batard!” he heard the man curse in French. The damned cyclist had jumped him from behind.
The woman laughed musically, her voice deceptively soft, as she grabbed the knife from where it had fallen. At last, Roderick managed to twist out of the cyclist’s grip. He struck the man again for good measure, then took off running again, this time in the opposite direction, back into the shadows of the alley.
He ran until his chest ached and his feet stung, and still he kept running. Everywhere he turned, he could feel the woman’s presence behind him, even when he didn’t dare risk another look behind him. She was a relentless hunter, and he was the prey. He thought about stopping and trying to fight again, but then he thought of the man in the café, and thought better of it. She was a ruthless killer; he’d gotten lucky when he’d surprised her. He might not be able to do that again. Better to run.
He leapt over a fruit stand, causing the merchant to jump up and exclaim, “mon dieu!” Seconds later, he heard the man shout the same exclamation, meaning the woman was only a second behind him. His only comfort was that Sébastien and Bailey had gotten away.
He could practically feel her breath at his back, and he imagined that cold blade thrust into his neck. How in the hell was he going to lose her?
He needed to do something.
He darted across the road, down a side street. He was beginning to slow. How long had he been running already? He took another sharp turn. Still he could hear her, gaining, always gaining on him.
Do something, do something, do something.
He dashed onto the road, dodging a passing hansom and had a stroke of genius. As the next carriage came rolling past, an open Victoria with the driver on a raised seat at the rear, Roderick grabbed hold of it. It wasn’t going fast, but it was going faster than he was running. The cart’s momentum hauled him off his feet. He dropped his swordstick and scrambled to find purchase. Hanging tight, he tried to lift himself up onto the raised seat, legs swinging below.
The driver, noticing his unwanted passenger, turned around and started yelling at him in French. Roderick ignored him and tried to haul himself up. It wasn’t easy, as the carriage bumped along the road, but the driver made it more difficult still, when he started hitting Roderick with his horsewhip.
“Ouch!” Roderick cried, “stop that!”
Finally, he managed to heave himself onto the seat beside the driver, who was still trying to whip him. Roderick grab the whip and managed to wrest it from the irate driver. Once he had the whip in hand, he turned around to see his pursuer finally falling behind. She had stopped running, but there was a look on her face that unsettled him. It was a look that suggested she knew something that Roderick didn’t.</Text>

            <Title>Scene 30</Title>
            <Text>The Penny Dreadful was afloat above Hyde Park, looking down from a grey sky upon the deserted park-grounds. Fog roiled across the ground, casting the city in a drab, sepia palette. The rain had cleared some time in the morning, but left the thick pea soup fog in its wake. In a way, it was the perfect cover. Working in shifts, the captain and his crew had kept the Dreadful afloat throughout the night, giving Jonathan Grimmer a chance to sleep. At first, he’d resisted the idea of sleeping while the city was being overrun by zombies, but eventually, fatigue and drunkenness had persuaded him to lie down, just for a few moments.
The Dreadful, kept aloft by a dozen ballonets filled with hydrogen, encased in a long blimp that was torpedo-like in shape, could sleep half a hundred passengers comfortably, not to mention the crew. Like an overgrown ornithopter, it had huge leather wings attached to its sides. Propellers lined the ship’s gondola, and sails were mounted beneath its underbelly and along its spine. Jonathan had worried about keeping the ship floating during the rainstorm, but the captain had assured him that unless lightning struck, they would be safe enough. If it looked like the storm would worsen, they would find somewhere to land.
But Jonathan awoke to find that they were still afloat. He looked out the porthole in his bedroom, and saw that it was no longer raining. The sun was out, although it was hidden by a veil of fog.
“Captain,” he said.
There was a telephone in Jonathan’s bedroom, with a thin tube running from the small brass mouthpiece into the wall. His voice travelled down the tube and—with some scientific explanation beyond Jonathan’s comprehension—reached the captain. He cradled the earpiece against his shoulder, and listened.
“Sir?” came Captain Merrick’s voice, distorted and tinny through the brass earpiece. It reminded Jonathan of the way voices sounded when played through a gramophone.
“Take me to the Grimmer Company headquarters, please,” he said.
“Yes, sir.”
He hung the brass can back on its stand, as the ship answered with a groan of straining wood and rope, the grinding of gears, and a blast of steam. The ship lurched and Jonathan stumbled and grasped one of the many railings that lined each room throughout the airship. The ship pressed on and settled into a steady rhythm.
Jonathan made his way to the lounge and settled into an armchair.
The lounge was lavish, even by Jonathan’s standards. Furnished with antique furniture that was surprisingly comfortable and apparently quite expensive, at least according to Jonathan’s mother. There was also a fully stocked bar. But Jonathan rang the bell for tea. He needed to keep a clear head, and he was still recovering from last night’s overindulgence with the green faerie.
The tea arrived with a few slices of lemon and a couple of biscuits. Jonathan stirred the lemon into his tea, as he watched the darkness of London pass by through the window. It seemed, from where he sat, that it was the city that was moving and not the airship. The ship was steady enough that his teacup barely rattled as it sat on the table at his side.
Setting his tea aside, Jonathan moved to the window, and surveyed the wreckage from above. There were parts of the city that looked like war zones. Shattered glass, broken-down doors, scattered pieces of furniture, and debris of all sorts were strewn about the streets. Only in those parts of the city afflicted by the zombie plague. The rest of the city looked as it always did. Oddly, the afflicted areas seemed to spread outward from a central point. It was as though the virus began from single points of origin and spread out from there, the damage being heaviest at the centre-point. Hyde Park Corner, St. James’s Square in Pall Mall, Piccadilly Circus, Trafalgar Square. All high-traffic areas, Jonathan realized.
As they crossed the Thames, Jonathan squinted against the glare of the sun on the glass, and saw that Borough Market had likewise been affected by the zombie outbreak. South of that, to Jonathan’s relief, there were no signs of the Lazarus Virus. But if the plague spread, it would soon reach the Grimmer Company. The Resurrectionists may have killed Jonathan’s father, but they had also studied the Lazarus Virus. If there was anyone who knew of a cure, it would be the Resurrection Man. Jonathan needed to find him.
The ship slowed suddenly, announcing they’d reached their destination. Jonathan swallowed the last of his tea and set the cup down.
“Now arriving at Grimmer Company headquarters,” the captain’s voice resonated through the ship, coming from the speaking tubes, which wound through the ship, amplified by a set of brass cans like the one in Jonathan’s bedchamber.
Jonathan headed towards the bridge, as the Dreadful began to expel hydrogen, allowing it to lower its altitude. He ducked under a wooden strut and stepped into the noisy engine room. A wave of heat rushed over him. The engineers were busy tending to a wall of complicated machinery and shoveling coal into the furnace, goggles on their faces, drenched in sweat.
Jonathan hurried past, heading out the opposite door and grasping a railing as the ship jolted suddenly. After a moment, it settled enough that he could continue.
Before leaving the ship, he tracked down one of his crewmen, intending to ask a favor. The man stood to attention and saluted.
“That’s not necessary, Mr—”
“Lockwood, sah. Kipper Lockwood. But most folks call me Kip.” He took off his hat and wiped sweat from his brow.
Jonathan nodded thoughtfully.
“A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Lockwood,” he replied. “I’m Jonathan Grimmer.”
“We’ve met before, sah,” said the crewman.
“We have?”
“I’ve known you since you was a li’l boy, sah. I’ve been a crewman for years.”
“Right, of course,” said Jonathan, making a mental note to pay more attention to his crew. After all, it wasn’t his father’s ship any more. It was his. “Now, Mr. Lockwood—”
“Call me Kip, sah.”
“Kip, then,” Jonathan said. “I wonder if you might be amenable to completing a bit of extra work for me while the ship’s aground? I’d pay you for it, of course.”
“Yes, sah. Of course, sah,” he said. “Only, what sort o’ work is it, sah?”
“A friend of mine was arrested. I need you to get a message to him.”
“Sorry to ‘ear ‘bout yore friend, sah,” Kip replied.
“An acquaintance, really,” said Jonathan.
“All the same, sah. Ah’ll get ‘im the message, no problem, sah. Which prison is it?”
Jonathan shrugged. “I’m not sure.”
“Shall I start wiv Newgate, then, sah?”
“I should think so,” Jonathan said. “Thank you, Mr. Lockwood,” he said, and corrected himself, “Kip.”
“The, uh, the message, sah?” Kip asked.
“Right,” Jonathan said. He fished into his pocket for a pen, and being a newspaper man, found one. He took out a pad of paper and quickly jotted down the message.
He gave the message to Kip, and shook the man’s hand. Apparently happy to have a bit of extra coin coming in, Kip turned to leave. Jonathan stopped him.
“Sah?”
“Be careful,” Jonathan said.</Text>

            <Notes>If Henry Charles Ocelot was right, and Parson Sinews really was innocent, then the Resurrectionists might still be looking for Jonathan. Even if Sinews was the Resurrection Man, his arrest did not mean that Jonathan was safe. He didn't know for certain that the Resurrectionists' orders came directly from the Resurrection Man. They might continue to come after him, even with Sinews behind bars. They'd seen his face. They might know who he was. They might know where he lived.
He couldn't hide forever though.</Notes>

            <Title>Parson moved back across the tiny cell and sat down copy</Title>
            <Text>Parson Sinews moved back across the tiny cell and sat down upon the uncomfortable bed. He still had the alarming feeling that the floor was moving. It felt unsteady beneath his feet. Though he couldn’t quite shake the feeling, even when he sat down on the bed, he attempted to relax on the wooden frame.
The Mad Priest lingered by the bars that separated their cells. He stood there for a while without speaking, as if taking the time to formulate his thoughts, or perhaps he was just sleeping standing up.
“How do you imagine you’ll escape?” asked the priest.
“How do you know I was thinking of escaping?”
“Every prisoner imagines escaping,” Pieres answered. “It wouldn’t be a prison if the prisoners were content to stay put. After all—” He broke off at the sound of the guards making their rounds.
The small metal door slid open and a tray of something vaguely resembling food was shoved into his cell.
“What is this?” said Mr. Sinews, staring at the gruel.
“You were expecting tea and crumpets?” asked the guard. He laughed and marched onward.
Mr. Sinews groaned as he got out of bed and retrieved the meal. Cold porridge with a few dark brown chunks of what he hoped was dried fruit.
“You were saying?” he said, spooning some of the gruel into his mouth and attempting not to grimace at the taste and texture.
“Ah,” said the priest, “Well, merely that I’ve been here for something close to two years already. I’ve lost track of the days. Yet every day I’m confined in my cell, do you know what I think of?”
“Escape,” Parson answered.
“Escape,” the priest confirmed. He grunted appreciatively as he ate his meal, while Parson struggled to keep his down.
Mr. Sinews set down his meal.
“I imagine that after two years in this place, you have come up with some ideas…” he said.</Text>

            <Title>They passed over Gravesend on their way back to London</Title>
            <Text>They passed over Gravesend on their way back to London. Jonathan stood at the window and looked down at the damaged little town. They flew low so Jonathan could make out the town pier—still under repairs since the attack—and all the trampled houses and businesses. It looked like a tornado had torn through the little village. Jonathan felt guilty for leaving so soon, rather than helping the people of Gravesend to deal with the aftermath.
They had their own issues to deal with though. It had been three years since Jonathan had seen his mother. He suspected the Resurrectionists had taken her to Chateau d’If, along with Parson Sinews, and had hoped to glean some more information from the elusive gentleman, but the only other prisoner Parson had so much as glimpsed was an old priest who died while in captivity. Jonathan sighed. Chateau d’If was a roaming airship; it never landed, and unless they stumbled upon it, there was no way of finding it. Jonathan would have to worry about Chateau d’If later. For now, they needed to find the Resurrectionists’ laboratory, deep within the quarantined zone of London. And that was surrounded by a guarded wall and filled with infectious gas.
There was another problem too, and Jonathan felt obliged to share it with the crew. He turned from the window. “Before we left for Paris, I received a letter from Her Majesty the Queen,” he said.
Technically speaking, the airship crew were now agents of the crown; since the monarchy was funding their operations, they were bound by duty to do as bidden. Regular patrols around the perimeter of London, missions to neighboring townships to monitor the spread of the zombie virus beyond the city walls, these were all part of their responsibilities. Embarking on a suicide mission to London was not.
“We have been instructed to report to Hampton Court for a mission briefing.”
Since Buckingham Palace was under quarantine, the Royal Family had relocated to Hampton Court in East Molesey.
“Mission briefing?” Annabel repeated. “What sort of mission briefing?”
“The letter was somewhat vague,” Jonathan replied, “but it doesn’t matter. We aren’t going.”
“Good show, old thing,” Roderick put in. “I, for one, am tired of Queen Vicky telling us what to do.”
Dr. Sound let out a gasp.
Roderick snorted. He turned to the scientist and added, “With apologies to Her Royal Lap Dog.”
Sound winced as if slapped.
Sinews gave an amused laugh. “Roderick, you’ve been in France. Surely Queen Victoria hasn’t been dropping by to tell you what to do?”
“Perhaps not,” Roderick admitted, “but all the same, we’ve already got a mission.”
“Exactly,” said Jonathan. “We’re going to London. That mission must take precedence. We’ve waited too long already. The Resurrectionists have taken shelter within the infected city, where no man dares look for them. We must remind them that they are not safe there.”
“Hear, hear,” said Parson Sinews, with a grin. Henri-Charles, at his side, gave a nod, his face otherwise impassive.
“We have allowed ourselves to become comfortable with the Resurrectionists hiding in their hole, because we believed we could not get to them, and because we believed we had more pressing threats to deal with: the zombies. However, the Resurrectionists are back at it. They nearly wiped Gravesend off the map. They killed some of our own. If the crown will not allow us to search the city for them, we must take action without the crown’s blessing,” Jonathan continued.
“This is treason you’re talking about,” Dr. Sound objected.
“It is,” Jonathan agreed.
“I’ll have no part of it,” he said, getting out of his chair and putting a finger in Jonathan’s face.
Jonathan offered him a polite smile. “Very well, doctor. I can’t force you to do anything with which you are uncomfortable. We’ll simply let you off here.”
The scientist calmed. “Well, that’s good then. Thank you.”
“Not at all,” said Jonathan. He turned to Annabel. “Toss the good doctor overboard, will you? He wants to be let off here.”
“Thought you’d never ask,” Annabel replied, flexing her metal bicep and rotating her clockwork hand. She grabbed the scientist by the collar.
His eyes went wide, and he began shouting. “Unhand me!” he cried, as Annabel dragged him from the lounge to the hatchway. He started kicking and screaming as Annabel opened the hatch. “Stop! Wait! I don’t want to be let off! I don’t want to be let off! Please!”
“Very well. Let him go,” Jonathan said. “I’ll have no further objections from you, Doctor.”
“None at all,” Sound answered weakly.
A sharp whistle came through the speaking tubes, followed by the pilot’s voice. “We’re being followed,” he said. “Military airship, gaining on us.”
Jonathan swore. “I may have forgotten to mention, the queen did imply that there would be disciplinary actions if we failed to show up.”
He headed for the door.
The boiler room was swelteringly hot as the crew continued to shovel coal into the furnace. Jonathan ducked under the low ceiling and stepped through the hatch. He grasped the railing as the wind threatened to shake him from the deck. His sweat turned cold in an instant, and he shivered, surprised by the sudden change in temperature.
He crossed the deck to join his pilot at the helm of the ship.
“Can we lose them, Ollie?”
“We can certainly outpace them,” the aeronaut replied, “the only question is how long we can keep that up. Lose them where? We haven’t got anywhere to go except—”
“London,” Jonathan finished. “We’ll lose them beyond the wall.”
“You don’t think they’ll follow?”
Jonathan looked over his shoulder and caught a glimpse of the imposing military ship. It was fast, to be sure, but it was also loaded from head to toe with weaponry.
“I don’t think we have much of a choice.”</Text>
            <Notes> However, the Resurrectionists would have a route map that would lead them back to Chateau d'If. Eventually, they would find it, and Jonathan would find his mother.</Notes>

            <Title>Scene Three</Title>
            <Synopsis>Annabel infiltrates the Grimmer Company, only to discover that Jack has already unleashed his clockwork crows, spreading Lazarus throughout the city.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Annabel Grey, better known as Miss Monday, crept along the hallway of the Resurrectionists’ underground headquarters in the basement of the printing company. Once a sanctuary for the monster hunters known as The Hunting Society, it was now a sanctuary for the monsters themselves. Annabel had to remind herself that not all of the scientists were willing accomplices to Anthony Tidkins’ plot, but had been unknowingly fed drugs that had addled their brains and influenced their decisions. Still, if it came down to it, she wouldn’t hesitate to kill them. If it couldn’t be helped.
“This way.”
She turned to follow Abraham Palmer down a hallway she hadn’t been down before. It was impossible to guess the size of the facility, but it seemed labyrinthine, given the number of unexplored corridors, offices, and laboratories.
It was only due to Mr. Palmer’ familiarity with the complex’s layout that they were able to find the Beta Laboratory. With a silent exchange of glances, she signalled that she was ready and waited for Palmer’ confirmation. He slipped on his Resurrection mask, and nodded.   Annabel drew her pistol, held it at her hip. She pushed open the door.
The Beta Lab put its Alpha counterpart to shame, at least in size. It was a vast, open space that made Annabel forget how deep underground they were. A number of enormous machines took up space within the room, boilers at work, hissing steam, chemicals running through tubes. Several rows of operating tables spanned the room, tubes running from the machines to the bodies on the tables. Colourful liquid pumped into their veins, while they struggled against their bonds. Each body on each table was strapped down, wrists and ankles cuffed so tight the the bonds cut into their skin. Not that they would feel it; they were zombies.
Despite the barbaric experiments that were conducted here, there was a clinical cleanliness to the room, a thorough organisation to the madness. Annabel wondered if the men on the operating tables had been dead when the experiments had started, whether it was the disease or the cure the Resurrectionists were pumping into their veins.
A series of hazy black and white photographs were pinned to one of the walls. Unusual photographs of the subjects’ skeletons.
Another section of the laboratory seemed to be dedicated to the study of those corvine birds that had provided the emblem for the Resurrectionists. Tubes filled with blood were stored in a glass cabinet, kept cool with some kind of cooling device. Condensation had formed upon the glass. A dozen dissected birds were mounted with labeled pins, while the living birds squawked in their cages as scientists pricked them with needles, either drawing blood or injecting the crows with something. It was part rookery, part slaughterhouse, part monster hospital.
For a minute, Annabel and Abraham went unobserved, which gave them ample time to take stock of the laboratory. Eventually, the living men in the room seemed to notice the presence of the intruders. Annabel made a quick count of the Resurrectionists. Eight of them, more than she had bullets for; luckily, they didn’t know that.
She recognised one of them, despite the mask he wore. His posture, greying hair, and age-spotted skin gave him away.
“What are you doing here?” asked Dr. Simms.
“How’s the head?” she asked him.
Abraham quieted her with a look. She frowned, but let him take the lead.
“I have the subject in hand,” he said, taking her in hand and nudging her forward. He used his own body to conceal her weapon.
“The subject? You mean Miss Monday?” said the scientist, though he could see her with his own eyes. Further evidence that he’d been exposed to Jack’s serum. “Good, very good. Get her strapped down. There’s an empty table, just there.”
Slowly, Abraham moved her forward, careful to angle himself so as to keep her weapon hidden from view, until he stood adjacent to the scatterbrained Resurrectionist. Only then did Abraham let her go.
The moment he did, she caught Dr. Simms in a headlock, pressing her pistol against his skull. He yelped in surprise, and some of the Resurrectionists drew their own weapons. Only three of them were armed. Annabel positioned herself so that they didn’t have a clean shot at her without risking killing Dr. Simms.
“Put your guns down,” she instructed.
“Do as she says,” said Abraham.
Slowly, careful not to make any sudden moves, the gentlemen complied.
“The night Lord Henry Connor was killed, I was hired to take something from his safe. According to Mrs. Grimmer, whatever it was, it was brought here.”
She spoke quietly, directing her words to Dr. Simms alone. He moved his head. She wasn’t sure if he was trying to nod, or simply get free of her grasp.
“I would tell you what it was that you stole, but I imagine the science will be beyond your comprehension,” he said.
“Humour me.”
“Very well. Are you at all familiar with the work of Nikola Tesla? I imagine not.”
“I am, as it happens. I was hired to relieve him of his experiments, on our mutual friend’s behalf,” she explained. “I made it look like his work had been lost in a fire, but the reality was that Jack had hired me to steal his research.”
“You continue to surprise me, Miss Monday,” said Dr. Simms, his voice still strained by her headlock. “Now, where was I? Ah, yes, Mr. Tesla had been experimenting with a technology that he called teleautomatics. Perhaps you heard about his demonstration of the technology. He used it to control a small boat, operating it with no wires, using a surprisingly small radio controller.”
“Go on,” Annabel told him.
“It was Lord Connor’s idea to use the technology to control the distribution of the Lazarus Virus. As we speak, there are mechanical crows being released at key points throughout the city. Trafalgar Square, Hyde Park, Borough Market, Westminster Palace. Each crow contains a vial of liquid laced with the Lazarus Virus. With the push of a single button on a single remote, the crows will release the gas. That’s what you stole, Miss Monday.”
Annabel’s felt the breath stolen from her lungs.
“You’re going to destroy the radio controller.”
“No,” he replied.
“Yes,” she insisted, pressing the pistol hard against his skull so he’d get the message.
He began to sob.
“No, no, no,” he said, tears staining the inside of his mask. “You don’t understand. You don’t understand.”
“Calm down,” she said. “I’m not going to shoot you, so long as you cooperate. What don’t I understand?”
“The radio controller…” he said, still sobbing, unable to finish his sentence.
Annabel almost felt sorry for him. After all, the man had been brainwashed by Jack’s serum. He might have been a good man, before that.
“What about it?”
“The radio controller…” Simms said again, looking at Annabel out of the corner of his eye. “It’s already been activated.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene 24</Title>
            <Synopsis>Roderick escapes Connor’s mansion.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Taggert had taken to striking with his baton, but not all of the zombies fell to his blows as easily as had Nichols. Not all of the dead had decomposed so quickly as he had.
The rotten ones, their brains bashed in easily enough, beneath Taggert’s baton, but the rest had thicker skulls. Roderick could see that Taggert was exhausted already. His officers, having likewise expunged their limited supply of munitions had taken up Taggert’s strategy, battering the undead with their batons. Roderick wished for a baton himself. He found a small letter opener among the contents of Connor’s desk drawers; it was all he had to defend himself with.
Some of the dead were on their hands and knees, crawling their way forward. These, Roderick dealt with himself, jamming the letter opener into their brittle skulls, or stomping on their heads with his bare feet. Their heads caved in beneath his feet as easily as squashing insects. He felt bile rise up in his throat, but he swallowed it and returned to his gruesome work. Thick blood spilled from the zombies, dark and rotten. Roderick’s feet were drenched in the vilest gore, and he worried there might be shards of bone cutting into his skin. He worried this affliction could be passed on through the blood.
Like Taggert, Roderick was quickly becoming exhausted. He couldn’t keep this up for long. Soon enough, he’d tire, and when he did, the dead would be on him in an instant. They were slow, clumsy, and easily dispatched with a blow to the head, but they were relentless. And there were hundreds of them.
Roderick didn’t know what the dead wanted. Would they eat his flesh, or simply kill him and move on to the next victim? One thing was clear, though; they were intent on hurting him. They wanted to sink their fingernails into his skin or to tear open his throat with their teeth. They lunged at him with their mouths open, swatted at him with their hands, and there was hunger in their otherwise dull eyes.
Finally, an opening presented itself. It was not the opening Roderick would have hoped for, and it took all of his wits for him to see it that way. But it was an opportunity. The gnashing teeth of the dead had found their prey. The tall, dark-haired policeman. Roderick couldn’t even remember the man’s name, if he had bothered to learn it. Now he was watching the man die.
He let out a piercing scream as his throat opened, gushing blood. In a moment, the rest of the dead had turned their attention to the fallen officer, sticking their hands with such force into him, as to rip his clothes to shreds and tear into his flesh with their nails and their teeth.
Roderick watched, distracted by the horrific scene, as the dead bloodied their lips and pulled lengths of the man’s intestines from his body.
Silently, he grabbed Taggert’s arm, dragging him away from the scene. Like Roderick, the man had fallen into silence and inaction. At first, he resisted Roderick’s attempt to drag him away. He was fixed on the scene. At last, he turned to Roderick, and with wide eyes, nodded.
Taggert turned to the other remaining policeman, and called to him, his voice barely a whisper.
“Hargrave!” he called. The man didn’t answer. “Richard!”
At last, Hargrave turned away from the scene, horror written across his face, tears streaming down his cheeks.
“We have got to go,” Taggert told him.
Hargrave hesitated.
“Now, Hargrave! Taggert hissed.
Distancing themselves from the dead, the three remaining men backed quietly away, leaving the zombies to their feast, taking advantage of the distraction to let the remaining dead into the room. For the moment, they were invisible. The zombies were blind to all but the dying man, his flesh exposed, his meat quickly being stripped from his bones. They walked past Roderick, Taggert, and Hargrave as if they weren’t even there.
Finally, when the dead were no longer crawling through the doorway in droves, they left the room, careful not to make a sound lest they distract the dead from their feast.
They encountered a few stragglers on their way out, but dealt with them with their billy clubs. When they eventually stepped outside into Connor’s garden, Roderick had never breathed a fresher breath of air in London in all his life. It was short-lived.
“Roderick, there are more of them out here!” Taggert cried.
Roderick gaped at the scene in front of them. Taggert was right. There were zombies everywhere. They were roaming the street. Their inhuman moans reverberated across Lincoln’s Inn Fields. Roderick heard distant screams, and knew that somewhere nearby the dead were attacking the living, as they had attacked the slain policemen. The zombies moved as one, turning their dead eyes on Roderick and the two policemen.
“They must have gotten out of the house,” said Taggert.
Roderick shook his head.
“Look,” he said, “Over there.”
Roderick was looking at one of the zombies: a child, poor, dirty, his feet bare, his clothing ragged and spattered with blood. Even as Roderick stared at the zombie child in horror, he grasped what it meant.
“This boy wasn’t at Lord Connor’s ball. He couldn’t have been,” he hissed to Taggert. “This incident was not confined to the masquerade.”</Text>

            <Text>When Annabel first met Anthony Tidkins, she had been fascinated by him, walking through the streets of London with a parasol above his head. She’d never seen a gentleman with a parasol before, that feminine accessory more regularly used by ladies. His was of a distinctly more masculine design, if such a thing were possible, but it wasn’t the parasol that gave her pause. It was the paleness of his skin, so white she felt that if she squinted she might actually be able to look through him. His eyes were a soft pink colour, his eyelashes long but white as snow. His hair was that wintry white as well, and his body waif-like, thin. Aside from the parasol, he was dressed to the height of fashion, immaculately dressed in dark but rich tones of grey and blue.
He wasn’t considerably older than she was, perhaps fifteen, sixteen maybe, while she was nearing nine. He was a gentleman, however, and she was an urchin. She began following him, at first out of mere curiosity. Then as she continued to thread her way through the marketplace, following his footsteps, it occurred to her that he must be absurdly wealthy.
Annabel, with her plain and tattered skirt, brown fingerless gloves and hair knotted and messy, was keenly aware of her own social status, as she tailed the wealthy young man. She couldn’t imagine what he was doing in the Old Nichol in Bethnal Green, a bleak neighbourhood consisting of ramshackle tenement buildings, a labyrinth of filth-ridden streets, the home of the downtrodden. Here, Annabel knew girls only a little older than her—some her own age—who had already turned to that other, less dignified form of employment that girls of her social status often turned to, for money. In a few years, she might be forced to consider that herself. She had only one thing that would keep her from suffering that indignity. Sticky fingers.
She followed him from the Old Nichol all the way to the Columbia Market, where it was Annabel and not the albino that was out of place. There, she paused to watch him purchase a newspaper, and paid close attention to which pocket housed his coin purse. She followed him a little longer, waiting for the right moment. A horse was milling nearby, its cabriolet parked on the side of the road beside a haberdashery.
As the albino stopped beside the horse to look at some item on display in the shop window, Annabel settled on her game. The horse dodge. Without warning, she violently slapped the brim of his hat, causing the hat to fall over his eyes. While he was busy reclaiming his vision, Annabel was slipping her little fingers into his pocket. She closed them around the pouch and swiftly lifted it from the albino’s pocket. If all had gone according to plan, she’d have dodged beneath the legs of the horse and been out of sight before he’d righted his hat.
Instead, the pouch caught on something. A chain dangled between pocket and purse. The chain pulled, and the albino quickly extricated his hat from his eyes. But Annabel was not to be deterred. A knife flicked out of her pocket. Deftly, she sliced open the gentleman’s jacket, taking pocket, chain, and purse and all. Before he could react, Annabel slipped the purse into her own pocket and pointed the knife at the older boy, warning him not to try anything.
Then she was off, dodging beneath the legs of the horse. The game usually went more smoothly than this. This time, she was forced to flee, back into the crowd of the marketplace. She dove beneath vendors’ carts and weaved through a sea of pedestrian traffic. The city was her playground, and she’d played this game before. She never lost. The trick was that she was always the first to start running.
This time was no different, except in one regard; the albino hadn’t even bothered to chase after her. He simply smiled as he watched her flee. When Annabel realised that he wasn’t about to continue chasing her, she opened her palm in order to examine her prize. Her eyes grew big and bright. Such a score! What she held in her tiny palm was more than a year’s salary for a man of modest income.
###
The next time Annabel saw Anthony Tidkins was also the first time that Annabel had ever really been caught stealing. It was nothing overly fancy. A necklace. But the theft had been overly brazen, even for her; she’d stolen it right off a lady’s neck.
She had nearly gotten away with it, too. The lady seemed not to have noticed the absence of her jewelry from her neck. She must not have felt Annabel’s little fingers unclasping the necklace while the lady shopped. It was the lady’s husband that caught her. A large, burly man who seized Annabel by the wrists and threatened to break her arms for her crime.
“Begging your pardon, sir,” Annabel heard someone saying, but there were tears stinging her eyes. The man was holding her arms so tight she really thought he might break them. “The girl is my charge. I assure you, she meant no offence. She is silly, you understand. My apologies, the girl gave me the slip. I do hope she hasn’t been bothering you too severely?”
Finally, Annabel turned to look at the man. She recognised him immediately, even with her eyes a-blur with tears. The albino handed a few coins to the brute, who relinquished his grip on Annabel’s arms, took the coins. He seized his wife’s necklace from Annabel’s trembling hand and returned it to his wife.
“Just see to it that this doesn’t happen again,” he said with a growl.
“Yes, sir,” was the albino’s reply. There was the hint of an American accent to his voice, though Annabel couldn’t place the dialect. Just that he sounded a bit different from other upper class gentlemen.
Annabel looked up at her mysterious benefactor, wondering if she ought to flee. If he had rescued her only to enact his own form of retribution. But curiosity kept her.
“What do you want?” she asked.
“Nothing at all,” he answered.
“Then why help me?” she spat.
“I didn’t like how he was treating you, and I felt I was in a position to help you,” he answered.
Annabel studied his face to see if she was lying. If he was, he was a very clever liar. She still didn’t understand why he’d helped her though.
After that, she began seeing him more and more. Occasionally, he would buy her presents. Little things like clean clothes, a new pair of boots, and even books.
“I can’t read,” she told him.
“I could teach you,” he answered.
“Why?” she asked. It was a question she asked every time she met him, without fail. No one had been kind to her without reason.
One day, he finally answered honestly.
“You have a talent that I believe could be useful to me.”
She didn’t understand.
“I want to hire you,” he said.
“I’m not for sale,” she spat.
He smiled. “I mean to say that I wish to hire you as a thief,” he explained.
“Oh,” said Annabel, feeling silly. That wasn’t what she thought he’d meant. “What do you want me to steal?”
When he told her, Annabel nodded.
“I’ll do it,” she said. “I’m Annabel, by the way.”
“Jack,” he introduced himself, extending a hand. “Jack Bernhardt.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Synopsis>Anthony Tidkins murders a young woman.</Synopsis>
            <Text>A few weeks ago, a young man who walked with a slow gait paused to unfurl his umbrella before stepping out into the rain and fog. The dim light of a few street lamps pierced the blinding fog, cutting through the grey skies with orbs of yellow that melted into the mist.
Boredom consumed him, as he ambled slowly through London’s bleak streets without purpose, passing through neighbourhoods a gentleman of his prestige ought to have avoided. The coarse voices of beggars called to him as he passed, drunken cries suffocated by liquor. Whispered words from toothless prostitutes, muffled by the patter of rain upon cobblestone, hardly managed to arouse his curiosity.
He continued on his way through Whitechapel, not speaking a word to anybody, though he paused to lower his umbrella and to feel the rain pouring down upon his neck.
Jack The Ripper once worked here, he thought. On these very streets, picking out women whose guts he wanted to see from the outside, and whose blood he wanted to spill. He thought about what that must be like, not from the whore’s point of view, but from the Ripper’s.
Turning his thoughts to the contemplation of murder, he thought, was a certain way to dispel the boredom. But to act on those thoughts must be a different thing entirely. Was that why Jack had done it? To feel his own pulse quicken as he felt their hot blood upon his face, stifled their screams with a gloved hand upon their soft lips.
There would be fear in taking a person’s life, to be certain. Fear would be unavoidable. Fear of being caught, fear of being damned to hell, fear that his prey might not fall as easily as expected beneath his blade. But wouldn’t it be better to feel fear than this dreadful boredom?
Guilt. There would be guilt, too, wouldn’t there? Then again, he wondered. Maybe there would be no guilt. Perhaps the thrill of murder would overcome those scant feelings of meaningless remorse. Perhaps knowing that he could slit a woman’s throat and pluck out her insides as easily as slitting open the wax seal of a letter, made Jack feel so powerful as to render his victims’ lives meaningless in his eyes. Him, a god. A god of death and destruction, or a killing angel. The whores, ants at his feet. Ants, to be crushed, or burned by the reflected rays of the sun through a magnifying glass.
He wondered if he could do it. If he could be like Jack, powerful, able to claim lives without a single moment of regret, to feel their hot blood upon his cheeks. Him, with his practically excessive reverence for human life. He, who believed that nothing, not love, not art, not money, not even science, could possibly outweigh the worth of a single human life.
Could he cut into a woman’s flesh and pluck out her spleen? And if he did, would it thrill him? Would it quicken his pulse with fear and guilt and revulsion? Or would he hesitate, knowing the worth of that life? Would he pause to reflect at the immorality, halt and consider the villainy of even thinking those damnable thoughts that seemed to haunt him whenever he felt even the slightest boredom.
He felt his trousers tighten, felt the blood in his veins seem to quicken, felt his eyes light up with a fervour that made the darkness of the cloudy night seem bright, and knew the answer to his question.
He let his umbrella clatter upon the ground, stripped off his jacket and his vest, and threw them upon the ground. He peeled off his shirt as if overcome by fever, and let the rain beat down upon his chest.
“‘ello mister,” said a voice, drawing his attention away from the heavens.
A woman, delicate and soft-featured, though she was dirty and dressed in cheap and tattered cloth, raised her hand to her forehead to shield her eyes against the rain, and looked at him in surprise.
Her blue, flower-print dress was drenched in rain, her hair soaked, and she was evidently intoxicated, as she staggered in his direction.
“See somefin’ ye like?” she called, raising her dress up to reveal a set of long legs. She named a price, and when he said nothing, lowered it without a moment’s consideration. When he still made no reply, she cursed at him and turned to leave.
Suddenly, she took half a step backward, as she moved through the roiling cloud of fog and his masked face revealed itself to her. She caught a flash of pale skin beneath his mask, and through the foggy lenses of the mask, soft pink eyes. He moved slowly toward her, reaching into a small bag that he kept in his left hand, and withdrawing what appeared to be a perfume bottle, except that it was not filled with perfume.
He smiled beneath his mask, as the young woman watched him approach through the fog, surprise giving way to fear. 
Yes, he thought, at once thrilled and disturbed by the look on her pretty, young face. The answer was yes.
He tipped his hat and smiled, though she could not have seen his cheshire grin, as it was hidden by the bird-like leather mask of a plague doctor.
“Perfume?” he said, replacing the hat upon his head. His voice sounded strange and muffled through the leather mask, low and inhuman.
She shook her head and began to move away from him, backing up until she stumbled into a wall and lost her balance. She fell, mud and rain splashing upon her dress and legs. She kicked out and began to scramble, backward, away from him. Her shoe slipped off, but she hardly seemed to notice.
He leaned over her and squeezed the pump. A cloud of blood filled the air.
“Breathe it in, whore,” Anthony Tidkins said with a sneer. “Breathe it in.”</Text>

            <Title>Roderick realized something was wrong the moment he</Title>
            <Text>Roderick realized something was wrong the moment he put his hand on the latch. The lock had been forced open. Warily, he opened the door and stepped into the studio. The gas lights were already flickering, though he’d switched off the gas before he left. He swung around, looking for any further signs of the intruder, and saw the woman.
“How in the hell—” he breathed.
He’d lost her when he’d clambered aboard the carriage. There was no way she could have beaten him here. He considered how he’d first seen her on the street ahead of him, but when he’d turned around, she’d been ahead of him again. It was as if she could be in two places at one. The only explanation was that there were two of her. This one wasn’t bleeding from her forehead where he’d hit her with the cane.
“Twins,” he said.
The woman smiled. “Ah, you are clever,” she said, speaking in French. “I’m Rachelle. I see you’ve met my sister.”
Roderick sneered. He replied in English out of spite. “Oh, yes. We’ve met. Gave her a nasty blow to the head, and I’ll do the same to you if you take one more step forward.”
The woman tutted. “I think we got off on the wrong foot,” she said, still speaking in French. She spoke with a foreign dialect. Roderick didn’t exactly have an ear for dialects, but he could make an educated guess. The woman was from one of the French colonies. Haiti? “I’m not here to kill you, Mr. Steen, if that’s why you were running. In fact, we need your help.”
“My help?” Roderick scoffed. He shouldn’t have been surprised to learn this woman was insane; why else would she join the Resurrectionists? The term mad scientists was basically invented to describe their once-secret society. “Why in the hell would I want to help you?”
“Because,” she said, her voice more sultry than her sister’s dulcet tones, “we have leverage.”
“What sort of leverage?” Roderick wanted to know.
“After you lost my sister, she managed to catch up with your assistant. Sébastien isn’t much of a cyclist, I’m afraid.”
“How do you know she caught him?” Roderick demanded.
“We have our ways.”
That smile of hers was arrogant and cruel. He wanted nothing more than to wipe it from her face, but if she really did have leverage...
“What have you done with Sébastien?” he fumed. “If you’ve harmed a hair on his head—”
“I’ve got Bailey as well,” he heard a voice from behind.
The second sister stepped into the room, a knife around Sébastien’s throat. There was a gash in this one’s forehead. She had Bailey in her free hand; the dog yipped at the sight of his master. Roderick moved to grab his dog, but the sister raised the knife blade and warned him not to move.
“I’m sorry, Roderick,” said Sébastien, and Roderick’s heart melted. Even now, Sébastien wasn’t thinking about himself. “I tried to get away, but I ran straight into her. What do they want with you, Roderick?”
He didn’t know how to answer that. He knew that he had no choice but bargain with them or risk them killing Sébastien and Bailey. Sébastien had become more than just an assistant to him over the past few months. He couldn’t risk losing him. And Bailey…he treated that dog better than he treated himself.
“Where do we go from here?” he said, turning to Rachelle.
“Give him the dog, but keep hold of the assistant. If he makes any sudden moves, cut his throat,” she told her sister. She turned to Roderick, auburn eyes fierce and terrifying. “We understand that in the past you’ve helped Scotland Yard with their investigations into the Resurrectionists,” she said. “By all accounts, you’re a genius at deduction.”
“You might have led with the flattery and passed on kidnapping my assistant and my dog,” Roderick spat.
“We’ve had a prisoner escape from Chateau d’If,” said Rachelle, ignoring him.
“We want you to tell us how he did it,” said the second sister.
“Sounds like this prisoner’s got you spooked,” Roderick observed.
“Maybe he has,” Rachelle admitted. “Chateau d’If is an airship. He escaped while it was a thousand feet in the air.”
“Perhaps he sprouted wings and flew away.”
“You’re playing with this one’s life,” said the sister with her knife to Sébastien’s throat. A single bead of blood formed on the assistant’s neck.
“What makes you think I know how he got away?” he asked, waving for the woman to stop. “If I knew, I would tell you. Just let him go, please!”
“We believe you. You don’t know how he got away. But we have high hopes that you’ll be able to figure it out.”
“With the right motivation,” the second sister added.
At last, Roderick understood. “You want me to go to Chateau d’If,” he said. It wasn’t a question, but a realization. Once they took him to the Resurrectionist prison, would they ever let him leave? Roderick doubted it. Just one look at Sébastien, though, and he knew he had no choice. “When do we leave?”</Text>

            <Text>“Who are you? What are you doing here?” said the doctor.
He was looking at Miss Monday as if seeing her for the first time. Jonathan made the sound of a cuckoo clock, nodding in the doctor’s direction. Miss Monday nodded her agreement. The doctor rubbed his head in frustration. Clearly the man was not all there, but it was also clear that he was aware of his lapsing memory.
“I’m not mad,” the scientist protested. “It’s just that sometimes I forget things. I smoked a lot of opium in my youth. I believe that may have something to do with it.”
“Ah, that is reassuring,” Jonathan replied, managing to keep the sarcasm from his inflection.
“Charles?” he said, turning from Miss Monday to Jonathan. His expression was one of recognition, but he was still clearly confused. He thought Jonathan was his father.
Jonathan shrugged.
“Yes,” he said. “It’s me. Doctor, I’m hoping you can tell me about Dr. Allen.”
“Dr. Allen?” said the scientist, laughing. “Why do you want to know about him? He’s not important. Not important,” he trailed off, muttering those words over and over again. “Not important.”
“Surely you’re mistaken,” Jonathan said, grasping the man by his shoulders until at last he seemed to snap out of it and look at him.
“Charles?” he said, again as if seeing Jonathan for the first time.
Letting him go, Jonathan took a step back.
“Dr. Allen was commissioned by the military to create super-soldiers, was he not? Whatever he was studying, it was important to the Resurrectionists.”
The doctor shook his head.
“No,” he said. “Well, yes and no.”
He seemed lucid, for the moment, even if he did think that Jonathan was his father. He watched as the scientist turned to the creature in the dank water, fatigue creeping into his voice as he explained.
“Dr. Allen, with the aid of a number of other prominent scientists, had undertaken a military contract, as you said, to create an army of super soldiers. They were studying something that they called genetics, a way of codifying an organism’s biological makeup. He believed that his research would allow scientists to actual modify that code, to combine one creature’s genetics with that of another. They were successful, even, in combining the genetic material of creatures long extinct with that of modern creatures, in order to bring these long-dead creatures back to life.”
“Another sort of resurrection,” Jonathan remarked.
“Yes. They were able to extract the genetic material from blood found in mosquitoes, trapped in amber, found in paleontological dig sites. The material was often sufficiently preserved that these scientists were able to bring these prehistoric beings to life. Superior soldiers indeed, except that they proved difficult to manage. Impossible to tame. Dangerous.”
“Hence the study of drugs for the purpose of behavioural modification?” he asked, referring back to Mr. Sinews’ discussion.
“No,” the scientist replied. “No, that was Anthony Tidkins’ field of research.”
“Anthony Tidkins?”
“Dr. Allen’s research on genetics proved unimportant. His experiments proved unsuitable for military use, and nothing more came of it. He was assigned to a new project, but he refused to participate. Until Anthony Tidkins perfected the serum. When the serum was given to Dr. Allen, he finally agreed to continue his research. But the serum was flawed. It should have made him compliant. Instead, it made him lose his mind.”
He exchanged a look with Miss Monday. This was all consistent with Parson Sinews’ theories, though he’d never mentioned anyone called Anthony Tidkins.
“Who the hell is Anthony Tidkins?” Jonathan demanded.
The scientist turned around to look, not at Jonathan, but at Miss Monday.
“Ask this one,” he said. “She’ll tell you. That eye she’s wearing. It’s his handiwork.”</Text>
            <Comments>Obviously, this was done in Jurassic Park. Still plausible since scientists have found mosquitoes in amber.  It might be a good idea to be a bit more vague on how/where they came across the DNA?</Comments>

            <Text>Jonathan clapped his arms around his friend’s shoulders. “It’s good to see you, Roderick,” he said, laughing as Bailey jumped at his leg, attempting to get in on the hug.
“And you, old chap!” Roderick replied, giving Jonathan a kiss on each cheek. “French custom,” he said, with a shrug, upon noticing Jonathan’s upraised eyebrows.
The airship was moored at an airship yard, the first of its like in Paris. A vast expanse of green divided by a heavy wooden pier into thirty enormous lawns, the shipyard closely resembled an oceanside dockyard, though the ships here were secured to tall metal turrets to keep them secure. The Dreadful was only one of many docked here; airships had become increasingly common among the wealthy ever since news of London’s disaster spread to the rest of the world. Apocalypse preparation was the new vogue. The air smelled of iron and coal. The shipyard was busy with the crew and passengers of dozens of airships, each as big as the Dreadful.
Jonathan stooped down to scratch Bailey’s head, then stood to meet the mutual friend Roderick had mentioned in his letter.
“Mr. Sinews,” he said, shaking the man’s hand.
“Always a pleasure, Mr. Grimmer,” Sinews replied.
After three years, Parson Sinews hadn’t aged a day, although his complexion was paler than usual, his eyes sunken in as if from lack of sleep. The last time Jonathan had seen him was in the basement of the Albion Theater, where he’d been held captive by the Resurrectionists, before they relocated him to Chateau D’If. He wondered if Sinews had been there this whole time. “It’s been a while.”
Sinews nodded. “Too long, I think, for friends to be apart. Roderick assures me that you’ve been looking for me. For that, I owe you a debt of gratitude.”
“I suppose you would,” Jonathan replied, “if we had been successful. As it stands, you owe us nothing. Of course, I’m not the only one who’s been looking for you.”
He gestured to Henri-Charles Ocelot, and Sinews’ smile broadened.
“I cannot begin to tell you how glad I am to see you, Henri-Charles,” said Mr. Sinews, his eyes crinkling as he smiled so sincerely that if Jonathan didn’t know better, he might have thought that Sinews was on the verge of tears. The smile suddenly melted into a tight-lipped sneer. “You cannot imagine the hell I’ve been through.”
“I’m sorry,” said Henri-Charles, his voice a low rumble like the thrum of distant thunder.
Just as quickly as the emotional outburst overtook him, Mr. Sinews’ mask of charm and ease spread across his face once more. His customary smile returned to his lips. “It doesn’t matter,” he said. “You’re here now, my old friend.” He turned to Annabel, eyeing her mechanical hand with open curiosity. “My, my, such a reunion this is! It is wonderful to see so many familiar faces. How do you do, Miss Grey?”
Annabel curtseyed. “Mr. Sinews,” she said.
He smiled, then stooped to kiss her hand. His gaze passed over the bespectacled Doctor Solomon Sound, then returned to his former valet. “If you’ll excuse me for a moment, Miss Grey, I’d like to have a word with Mr. Ocelot.”
He bowed, and with a nod from Henri-Charles, the two of them disappeared into the crowd and became as shadows.
“I still don’t trust that one,” Jonathan muttered to Annabel.
“Nor do I,” she replied. “That said, I don’t generally trust anyone.”
Jonathan nodded. More and more, he was beginning to feel the same way. He’d been betrayed once by someone close to him. Now he tended to think of people with skepticism and suspicion. He eyed Roderick’s new acquaintance.
“Ah, forgive me!” Roderick cried. “I would like you to meet Sébastien Bilodeau, my assistant.”
“Enchanté,” said Sébastien.
“How do you do?” Jonathan turned to the Penny Dreadful. “Gasbags have been refilled, and our supply of coal has been replenished. I expect that by now we’re nearly ready to depart. I’ll just nip over to the ship and have a word with Mr. Lockwood. And then, if all is well, we’re off.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene 54</Title>
            <Synopsis>Jonathan heads down into the basement with Palmer.</Synopsis>
            <Text>A red light began to blink beneath Palmer’s desk, electric and bright. It pulsed on and off, the red light casting an unnatural glow onto Palmer’s face.
“What is that?” Jonathan asked.
“Emergency alarm,” Palmer explained. “It means there’s a situation in the laboratory.”
“What kind of situation?”
“Suppose I’ll have to find out,” Palmer replied, standing up. “If you’ll excuse me—”
“I want to come with you,” Jonathan blurted out.
He was standing up now too, the silent alarm still pulsing, on, off, on, off. He put his hand on Palmer’s shoulder as the older man tried to brush him off.
“I want to see the lab,” he said. “I need to see it.”
“Jonathan, be reasonable,” Palmer replied, “The laboratory isn’t run by Grimmer and Sons any more. It’s run by Resurrectionists. They’ve come to trust me and your mother, because so far we’ve been cooperating with them. What do you think they’ll do if I bring you down there?”
Again, Jonathan had to grab ahold of Palmer to get him to stop and listen. He refused to be brushed aside like some sort of child. He was frustrated that both his mother and father had kept this monumental secret from him, but he had to admit he didn’t entirely blame them. He hadn’t taken his duties with the family business seriously. Why should he be trusted to take the Lazarus Virus seriously? But after what he’d learned from Parson Sinews, after seeing the destruction of the city from The Penny Dreadful, after having his throat nearly torn out by a dead man, Jonathan wasn’t about to be left out.
“You have a mask,” Jonathan said.
“What?”
“The plague doctor’s mask,” he said. “You have one, don’t you?”
“Yes, but—”
“Give it to me,” Jonathan told him.
“And what about me?” asked Palmer.
“You’ll say you forgot to put it on, in your haste,” Jonathan said. “Now, the mask.”
Finally, Palmer relented. He let out a heavy sigh as he fetched the mask in question. “Your mother is going to have my head if anything happens to you,” he said.
“Your problem,” Jonathan told him.
Palmer handed him the mask. He didn’t seem happy about it, but at least he was doing as Jonathan asked. Jonathan turned the mask over in his hands. Inside the beak-like protrusion of the mask was a rubber seal. A network of tubes, a filter.
“It’s a gas mask,” Jonathan realized.
The plague mask was not merely a symbol of the Resurrectionists, it was also a means of avoiding inhaling the infectious gas.
“So,” he asked, adjusting the straps on the plague mask to fit his face, “Where is this laboratory?”
Palmer chuckled, amusement crinkling the corners of his eyes as he went over to the bookshelf. He grabbed one of the books. It made a strange, mechanical sound, then snapped back into place on the shelf. Jonathan heard the distant rattle of heavy machinery, and stared at Palmer with confusion.
The sound seemed to be coming from below. He raised his eyebrows, forming a question, and frowned as the floor shook like the floor of an airship.
“You’ll see,” said Palmer, enjoying the suspense.</Text>

            <Text>Suddenly, the lights went out. The room went dark—save for a thin sliver of light filtered through a small, grime-coated window with thick curtains—and everything turned to chaos.
“What was that?” one of the sisters shouted.
“Cut his throat!” Rachelle shrieked.
Roderick heard the knife clatter to the floor. He saw a blur of green light and heard a rustle of cloth. There was a flurry of motion, and the flutter of iridescent wings of greenish black that glinted in the dim light.
A crescent of white caught the dim light, and Roderick recognized it as a smile. Sharp white teeth. He heard the flick of a blade and smelt blood. White teeth turned red. There was a blur of motion, a green shadow that melted in the darkness and formed again behind Rachelle. He heard a scream—cut short.
Blood spattered across the thing sliver of light from the window, and the woman’s body hit the floor. Sébastien screamed and reached for Roderick’s hand. Bailey barked furiously.
But just as quickly as the scene had turned to chaos, the scene suddenly stilled. The blur of motion resolved into a figure in the darkness. As Roderick’s eyes adjusted to the darkness, he began to recognize the familiar lines and edges that belonged to the shadow.
He let go of Sébastien’s hand and stepped toward the figure.
Green eyes looked back at him.
“Hello Roderick.”</Text>

        <Document ID="318">
            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>Mr. O began his day like any other, except that today he had an accomplice. At first, he’d wondered if she would show. He’d waited outside the Agency for what seemed like hours, until eventually, he saw her emerge through the fog, trudging through the puddles on the driveway in a pair of knee-high boots.
“I wasn’t sure you’d come,” he’d said.
“Neither was I,” she admitted. “But I want to know who killed Lord Connor. I want to know who hired me, because as you suggested, it certainly seems like a setup. And I want to know who hired those thugs to hunt me down. I don’t take kindly to people meddling in my affairs, making attempts on my life, that sort of thing. And as the envelope was filled with sheets of blank paper, our only remaining lead is the unliving. So, first tea, then zombies?”
Now, joined by Miss Monday, it was business as usual. They trudged through the muddy banks of the River Thames, both of them wearing tall leather boots, muddy water sloshing under their feet. Blood-red worms lay in clumps along the shore.
He wore brass goggles over his eyes. A medical mask covered his mouth and nose, which only somewhat stifled the stench of death and excrement. It had been years since the completion of the plumbing pipeline that ran through London, but the smell still clung to the riverside.
In the dry summer months, when the river was as dried up as it would get and the tide was at its lowest point, the river was barely more than a creek at its deepest point. And when its waters shrank back, it left a thick residue of red silt and mud and discoloured, reddened worms, which wriggled as they began to dry in the sun. They squished under his feet and filled him with waves of nausea.
High-powered rifle in his hands and at the ready, stepping carefully as he walked along the slick rocks, he scanned the banks for any sign of movement, careful not to fall into the river. Now and then he peered through the scope of his rifle, hoping to spot something he couldn’t with the naked eye.
“What are you hoping to accomplish here?” his accomplice asked.
“This is one of our regular patrol locations. For whatever reason, the dead seem to come here. I’m hoping we’ll find some without bite marks, or perhaps some other clue. If we’re lucky, they might even make another attempt on our lives.”
“Wouldn’t that be a stroke of luck?”
“Just remember. Rule number one. Do not let them bite you.”
“I’ll bear that in mind,” she replied.
It was a bit like fishing. Sometimes you’d spend half an afternoon or a morning just waiting, sipping whiskey from his flask. He’d spent dozens of afternoons in that way with Lord Connor, when he’d been an Agent. It was almost peaceful in those moments. Then, suddenly, something would bite.
Of course, they didn’t use worms as bait. He wasn’t sure what drew the dead to the river, but they didn’t eat the worms, and they didn’t drink the water. Sometimes he wondered if it was the smell that drew them here. The fact that the river’s stink would disguise their own smell.
“There,” he said at last, and aimed his gun by way of pointing.
“I see it,” said Miss Monday, looking out across the river.
His companion was dressed in a similar fashion to himself: tall leather boots, men’s trousers, medical mask over the mouth and nose. Unlike Mr. O, she also wore a whale-boned corset, a pair of peacock feathered earrings, a leather gun belt at her waist, and a patch over her right eye. From the right angle, she was astonishingly beautiful.
One of the pouches in her belt had been emptied of its revolver, which she now held in her right hand, aimed in the direction Mr. O had pointed out.
Upon a casual inspection of Miss Monday’s eyepatch, one might make the mistaken assumption that what she had strapped the lens of a camera to her eye—a lens which appeared to change focus automatically as she looked around. The truth, of course, was that the device was a prosthetic eye, though how she’d lost her eye was still a mystery to Mr. O. A long scar ran along the right side of her face, intersecting the clockwork apparatus. Through the genius of the device’s inventor, Miss Monday had been spared the loss of vision in her right eye.
Miss Monday watched with clockwork eye as the creature emerged from the fog-thick streets of London and approached the banks of the Thames. The poor wench, who shambled toward them from the other side of the river, had once been a young and pretty girl. Now, she was hideous. Grey and bluish skin, violet bags beneath red eyes, open and infected wounds in patches on her visible skin. Her clothes, nothing but a blue and threadbare dress with floral print, were torn and stained with blood and filth.
She sniffed through a broken nose, and even despite the stench of the river, even through her decaying nostrils, smelt them. She quickened her pace, opened her jaws so wide Mr. O could hear a sickening crack, and screamed in a way that was chillingly still nearly human.
She was about to plunge into the water.
“Don’t let her enter the river if you can help it,” said Mr. O. “She’ll be swept away by the current.”
Miss Monday opened fire, her bullet easily finding its mark. The girl’s head exploded in a shower of dried blood, and she stumbled backward and fell, face-first, into the mud and worms.
“Nice shot,” said Mr. O.
“I’m still getting used to this,” she said, as she holstered her pistol with trembling hands.
“Well, you’re doing just fine,” he reassured her.
“Don’t living people ever come down here?” she asked, as together they trudged through the muck toward the bridge. “You ever shoot anyone by mistake?”
Mr. O hid his rifle within the deep pockets he’d had sewn into his jacket for this very purpose.
“Of course. All the time,” he joked. “No, the living don’t seem to come here. Of course, I’m careful about who I’m shooting.”
Half a mile’s trudge through the riverbanks and they reached the cobblestone bridge. Mr. O began to wipe the mud from his boots; it came off in great piles of reddish brown and stuck to the edge of the bridge. Good enough, he supposed, since he’d be trekking back into the muck on the other side of the river anyway.
Finally, they reached the twice-dead corpse.
Mr. O bent down and turned her over. He reeled back.
“Good god, she stinks!” Mr. O complained.
Flies buzzed and worms clustered around the girl’s rotten face. Maggots crawled inside her mouth, though she couldn’t have been dead long. Still, the smell that emanated from her mouth was putrid. Even accustomed to this sort of work though he was, Mr. O had to resist the urge to gag on his every breath.
Everything about the girl’s face was ordinary, as far as he was concerned. Disgusting, but ordinary. But as his inspection moved from head to toe, he very quickly discovered something incredibly unsettling. Beneath the girl’s torn dress, there was a brass rod, jutting out through her skin, just beneath the collar bone.
With Miss Monday’s assistance and despite her protests against the impropriety, he managed to pry the girl’s clothes off and get a better look.
“What on God’s green Earth?” said Miss Monday.
“It looks almost like…” Mr. O began.
He stopped. He reached out with a gloved hand and placed it on a clockwork device that had been affixed to the girl’s chest with metal rods that pierced through her body.
“It looks almost like what?” Miss Monday asked.
“Nothing,” said Mr. O, “It’s nothing. Never mind.”
Miss Monday shook her head, and placed a hand upon his shoulder.
“What does it look like?” she persisted.
“Well,” he said, “It looks a bit like your eye, doesn’t it?”</Text>

            <Title>Wobbling both from the copy</Title>
            <Text>Wobbling slightly from the turbulence and the drink, Jonathan stood at the window, looking down at the toy-sized trees and river below. The airship’s speed never failed to astonish him.
“No sign of the thing yet,” he announced, turning back to face the gentlemen who’d assembled in the room.
The first was Henri-Charles Ocelot, a Haitian gentleman once employed by Parson Sinews as a valet. They’d crossed paths about a year ago, which was not entirely surprising given their mutual interest in locating Mr. Sinews, and it had seemed prudent to combine their efforts. He’d been aboard the Dreadful ever since. The man was fearsome in appearance, with one pale blue eye and one bright red; chipped and gold-capped teeth; and a necklace made of bones painted to look like brass. Contrary to appearances, he had an uncommonly gentle disposition, and Jonathan owed him his life.
The second man was Dr. Sound, a bookish professor appointed by the Crown to serve aboard the airship.
The monarchy officially opposed the Resurrectionist occupation of London, but in Jonathan’s opinion, the Crown actively continued to enable the Resurrectionists. Their base of operations was reputed to be somewhere underground, beneath London, within the quarantine zone, which was guarded heavily by the British military. So in a sense, the Resurrectionist scientists who destroyed London by unleashing the Lazarus Virus were now being protected by the military. So while Queen Victoria had sanctioned and now funded the Penny Dreadful’s operations and supported the crew’s mandate—to hunt and kill escaped zombies and track down any known Resurrectionists—Jonathan didn’t trust Her Royal Majesty’s motives. He regarded Dr. Sylvester Sound, therefore, with suspicion.
“In your opinion, Doctor, what do you think we’re likely to find?”
“Difficult to say, sir—”
“Plenty of things are difficult. Do make an effort.”
The professor frowned and ran a finger over his waxed mustache. “Very well,” he said. “The report we received suggested we would find—and I quote—an ‘abomination.’ As to what sort of abomination, I can only speculate, but please, allow me to do so. As we now know, death is a condition with varying degrees of finality. Zombies, for want of a more scientific term, are not actually dead. Their infection keeps their brains active, although their bodies continue to rot away. Despite continuing studies into the matter, there is still a great deal we don’t understand about the Lazarus Virus.”
“Yes, yes,” said Jonathan. He stood and headed over to the bar for another drink. “We all know how Lazarus works. This isn’t exactly our first tea party.”
“Yes, well,” the scientist continued, “here’s where it gets really interesting. What do you know about the Lazarus Virus’s interactions with non-human species?”
Jonathan shrugged. “Enlighten us,” he said.
“All right, well, as you may have read in the reports your crew retrieved from the Resurrectionist laboratory beneath the Albion, the virus can infect some non-human species, and when it does, the results are even less predictable. Some animals react much like men; they die, then subsequently revive as terrifying, unthinking cadavers with no recollection of their former selves and no loyalty to their former masters. Other animals show no signs of infection whatsoever; in particular, carrion birds tend not to react to the disease.”
“Hence the Resurrectionists’ experiments with crows,” Jonathan contributed. He’d seen the crows in the Resurrectionist laboratory. Anthony Tidkins, the leader of the Resurrectionists had been obsessed with them.
“Aside from carrion birds, we’ve yet to see any insects infected with the virus, although the reports from the Resurrectionist lab indicate that insects can contract the virus. Given that many insects are carrion-eaters, we should have seen cases of zombie insects, unless there are more factors at play. This is merely a working hypothesis, mind you, but I believe it takes more for an insect to become infected than merely being exposed to the virus.”
“Such as?”
“Haven’t the foggiest,” Dr. Sound replied, “but what I can tell you is this: according to the Resurrectionist files, the infected insects they observed underwent a dramatic metamorphosis. In layman’s terms, they transformed. Like a tadpole into a frog.”
Jonathan shared a look with Henri-Charles.
“According to the reports, the metamorphic transformations exhibited by the infected species tend to be much more dramatic than that. For instance, they undergo a dramatic change in size. Leeches, lice, and beetles, for example, are transformed into about the size of a Dalmatian. However,” he continued, “based on the trail this creature left behind, the damage left in its wake suggests it’s much larger than that. Much larger indeed. Based on its current trajectory, I believe it’s headed in the direction of Paris. Furthermore, if, like ordinary zombies, this overgrown insect is able to pass on the virus to humans, if it is allowed to cross the English Channel and reach Paris, the results could be devastating. It is imperative that we do not allow that to happen.”
“Good god,” Henri-Charles exclaimed, his voice a rich baritone, “one little bug? All that damage?”
Dr. Sound nodded. “Not such a little bug any more though,” he explained. “The Resurrectionists called these metamorphic insects BEASTS. That is, Beings with Extremely Abnormal Supernatural Traits.”
“Supernatural traits?” Jonathan asked. He stared into the amber-colored liquor in his half-empty glass, which rattled under another spot of turbulence.
“Supernatural, yes. That is, traits that defy the very laws of nature. In this case, the word supernatural refers to their unnatural size.”
“So,” said Henri-Charles, almost as if he were saying it to himself, “Our mission is to exterminate this overgrown BEAST before it arrives in France and turns Paris into another graveyard.”
“Just so,” Dr. Sound confirmed.
Henri-Charles and Jonathan exchanged another look. Jonathan gave him a nod.
“At least this confirms one thing,” Jonathan said, watching the professor for a reaction. “It proves the Resurrectionists are still at work.”
The scientist’s eyebrows furrowed, and his mustache seemed to twitch. “This hardly proves that,” he snapped.
“You said yourself that insects don’t contract the virus under ordinary circumstances and that, to the best of your knowledge, no one else had been able to replicate the conditions for insects to become infected. If the Resurrectionists did not deliberately infect this insect, how did it contract the zombie virus?” Jonathan said, his words beginning to slur. He took another swig of his drink and gestured to the barkeep for another.
“That was merely a hypothesis,” the scientist rebutted.
“Be that as it may,” said Jonathan, “my biggest concern at the moment is whether or not this dirigible will be enough to stop this beast.”
“It’ll have to be, Mr. Grimmer,” said Henri-Charles.
A sharp whistle interrupted their conversation. It was followed by the pilot’s voice through the speaking tube. “The abomination has been sighted. Starboard side, headed straight for Gravesend.”
Jonathan turned to the window. He saw it as soon as he looked out. The beast. His jaw dropped. He could hardly believe his eyes. The reality was far worse than it had ever been in his imagination.
“What is it?” asked Henri-Charles.
“Come and see,” Jonathan said. He could barely manage more than a whisper.
“It’s armed,” Dr. Sound exclaimed. He’d donned his pince-nez and joined Jonathan at the window. His eyes were wide as he stared, horror-stricken, at what loomed outside.
The specimen in question, flying just ahead of the Penny Dreadful, was a behemoth. It was easily as big as the Penny Dreadful, but twice as terrifying. With enormous, whip-like antennae, and a thick exoskeleton that seemed to cover its entire body, Jonathan had the disturbing suspicion that this abomination had once been a beetle of some kind. It looked a bit like an overgrown cockroach with wings.
Now, in its metamorphosed state, the creature was barely recognizable as an insect at all. It was a monster. With long legs and huge wings which beat rapidly, carrying the unbelievable weight of the creature across the sky.
Still, the most unusual thing about the creature’s appearance was the machinery fused with its body. The insect served as a shell for a massive airship, which was housed in the creature’s enormous belly. The ship obviously relied on the gargantuan insect’s own ability to fly, but it also boasted a number of additional propellers, presumably to improve the ship’s capacity for speed. Its operators were visible through a thick pane of glass at the front of the insect-turned-ship. Jonathan imagined the men inside weren’t merely passengers, but actually steering the mammoth insect like a vehicle. Attached to the creature’s anterior limbs was a pair of mechanical contraptions that looked suspiciously like machine guns. Jonathan imagined they could control those as well.
He turned to Dr. Sound. “You still maintain that the Resurrectionists are no longer active?”</Text>
            <Notes> From what we can tell, it’s passed from one victim to another via bodily fluids: blood, saliva, and so forth. Once infected, the victim begins to die. But it is in death that the disease truly takes its toll. After death sets in, he wakes up. Of course, when he does, he’s hungry.

Precisely so,” said Dr. Sound. “Dogs, horses, cats, and even rats can all become zombies, as we’ve seen in the days since the catastrophe. </Notes>

            <Synopsis>Annabel flees from Anthony Tidkins, and is helped by a mysterious Resurrectionist. It turns out to be Jonathan Grimmer, accompanied by Abraham Palmer.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Annabel raced down the hallway, the Resurrectionist in tow. The others were still banging on the door, demanding that he open it, but he was single-minded in his pursuit of her. It was difficult to run, her skirts trailing heavily behind her, and difficult to breathe, her corset tightly laced. The Resurrectionist was gaining ground.
Still she ran, her boots thudding hard against the concrete floor of the hall. In the dim lighting, she could see the brass cage of the elevator, not too far ahead. She raced toward it, breathing heavily. She slammed into the gate, unable to slow her momentum, but with barely a pause she threw the door open. She stepped inside and reached to shut the gates.
Too late. The Resurrectionist’s hand barred the gate. Annabel let out a surprised cry. She’d thought she’d been quick enough. The bastard was surprisingly strong. She tried to shut the gate, fighting against him as he strained to keep it open. She changed tactics.
She began to swat at his hand, trying to force him to release his grip. He yelped, but his grip was firm. She grasped his fingers with her own and began to peel them off, one by one.
“Stop!” he protested. “Stop it. I’m trying to help you.”
“Like hell,” she said.
Another man stepped out from behind him. She nearly jumped. Somehow she hadn’t seen him before. He was an older man, white-haired, in his mid-forties. Abraham Palmer, she guessed.
She knew this bastard was in collusion with Mrs. Grimmer. Together, they’d been plotting with the Resurrectionists. She told him what she’d heard.
“I can explain,” he said.
She imagined he could. Not that she was likely to believe his explanation, but she was sure he’d have one. But in the distance she heard the door beginning to splinter beneath the efforts of his fellow Resurrectionists, and she knew that she had little choice but to humor him. She was unarmed and outnumbered.
She looked at the one in the Resurrectionist mask.
“Take it off,” she instructed.
He did as he was told, unclasping the straps and slipping off the mask. His hair was damp with sweat, a side effect of wearing the leather mask, but he was handsome. Hold on—
Annabel recognized him. He’d been masked when they first met—not in the plague doctor’s mask, but in a masquerade mask—but even so, enough of his face had been visible that she could recognize him now. It was his eyes that she remembered most clearly. They’d been etched into her memory.
She caught a glimpse of recognition in his eyes, too, as she watched his vision hone in on her prosthetic eye. She’d been in male garb then, but the ocular device was enough to give her away, despite the disguise. He knew who she was, just as well as she knew who he was.
“Mr. O,” she said.
“Miss Monday,” he replied, his voice smooth. It sent a cool shiver rippling up Annabel’s spine. She cursed herself for thinking of such things at a time like this.
She recalled her conversation with Parson Sinews. Sinews had believed Jonathan Grimmer was innocent. She wasn’t so sure now. He wore the Resurrection mask, and stood at Mr. Palmer’s side. How could she trust him?
And yet, the Resurrectionists were banging at the door she’d come through. It wouldn’t take them long to get through. She decided to play along, for now anyway.
She stood aside, letting go of the elevator gate to make way for Mr. O—Jonathan Grimmer—and Mr. Palmer.
As she took hold of the lever and started up the ascent, Jonathan squeezed into the elevator and blinked at Annabel in confusion.
“Since when are you a woman?” he asked.
“My whole life,” she replied, not without humour. “I was wearing a disguise when we met, obviously. Easier to get into Lord Connor’s unnoticed.”
“Some disguise,” he remarked honestly.
She glanced upward, but it was impossible to see anything in the darkness of the elevator shaft, and even so her view was blocked by the roof of the cage.
The machine rattled noisily upward, but even despite the din of the elevator, they could hear the Resurrectionists breaking into the hallway below. They weren’t safe yet. Annabel doubted the floor was thick enough to protect them if the Resurrectionists decided to start shooting at them. And they could always just cut through the cord, and the entire cage would come tumbling down. She silently urged it to climb faster.
“Don’t worry. They want you alive,” said Palmer.
Annabel wasn’t convinced. She looked dubiously at the floor of the cage and listened for the sound of cutting rope. She could hear distant, muffled voices echoing up the shaft. Nothing else, but the ordinary clicking of gears and winding of pulleys.
“Why?” she asked, finally.
“At Lord Connor’s, you were exposed to the Lazarus Virus, were you not?” Mr. Palmer replied.
“I’m not sure,” Annabel told him. “But your associate gave me an injection. It was contaminated.”
“My associate?”
“Dr. Jekyll,” she said.
“Ah,” said Palmer. “I see. So, you are carrying the virus, even now?”
She didn’t know what he was getting at. Yes, she had the Lazarus Virus. She didn’t know exactly how it worked, or what would happen to her, but she knew that she would soon be a zombie, like the unbreathing one in the laboratory. Like Lord Connor, or the man who’d fallen from the second story of his mansion. Like the dead that roamed the streets of London.
“Yet you still display no symptoms whatsoever, of the virus.”
She looked at him, suddenly. She remembered the conversation she’d overheard, when sneaking about Lord Connor’s garden.
“I was given to understand that the—what’s the phrase? Incubation time?”
Palmer nodded.
“I understand that it varies.”
“True,” Mr. Palmer agreed. “Sometimes it takes minutes, rather than seconds, for the change to occur. An hour or two, at most.”
“What? But I’ve had it much longer than that.”
“The Resurrectionists believe you may possess immunity to the virus,” he said.
Annabel frowned, uncertain. It sounded too good to be true. Why her? Why should she be immune when so many had been infected so easily?
“So, you can rest assured they want you alive,” he told her, “After all, the entire point of their Dead London Project is to find a test subject with a natural immunity—”
The sound of a bullet interrupted his thoughts and proved him a liar. The bullet ricocheted inside the elevator shaft and struck the floor of the cage. It put a dent in the floor, but didn’t pierce the steel.
“You were saying?” Annabel said.
“Shit,” Jonathan swore.
More bullets joined the first, until the elevator shaft was filled with the banging of gunfire and smell of powder. Like the first, the subsequent bullets at first failed to break through the metal floor of the cage. But as the Resurrectionists continued to fire, Annabel felt a bullet whiz past her face. It struck the ceiling above. She looked at Jonathan as if she expected him to do something about it. As if he could.
“Why keep me alive when all they really need is my blood?” she asked rhetorically. “Are you armed, either of you?”
Another bullet put a hole in the floor, and whooshed past her head. It wasn’t as close as the first, but it was no less unsettling.
She looked to Palmer and held out her hand. He nodded, briskly, and offered up his firearm, a pinfire revolver.
She aimed the muzzle through the hole in the floor and fired. She heard a cry of alarm from below. Hopefully her bullet had struck home. She couldn’t see what she was shooting at. She fired again, and was answered with another alarmed shout. The Resurrectionists kept firing back, bullets ricocheting dangerously in the narrow elevator shaft.
Annabel fired, again and again, almost emptying the chamber. She wanted to save at least one bullet, just in case.
At last, the elevator shuddered to a halt, and Jonathan slid the door open. They practically tumbled out of the elevator. Annabel looked herself over and was relieved to see that while her skirt was ridden with bullet holes, she herself was unscathed. She looked to Jonathan and Palmer.
The older man was clutching his shoulder. There was blood seeping through his shirt and onto his hands. He must have been shot.</Text>

 had a handsome face. A scruffy layer of dark facial hair, brown eyes and a slight scar that ran down his cheek gave him a tough, masculine appearance.
Well, at least he was easy on the eyes, Annabel thought, even if she couldn’t trust him.</Notes>

            <Text>In the distance, factories belched black smoke from their chimney stacks. It oozed throughout the city, thick and black. It blended into the fog, until the fog and smoke were one, a thick haze of yellow grey that roiled along the streets, choking the lungs and clouding the air. This was the famous London Particular the city was famous for. Jonathan could see crows circling across the sky, but their movement seemed unnatural somehow, almost mechanical. Tendrils of fog seemed to linger in their wake. In the haze of rain and the shrouds of The Particular, there was a figure lying dead on the road.
“What is it?” Mr. Ocelot asked. He raised a hand to his brow to shield his eyes against the rain.
Jonathan signaled to the Penny Dreadful to wait, and looked to Ocelot. The bigger man’s expression was impassive, but he followed Jonathan as he hurried over to take a look. As they drew closer, Jonathan realized that he recognized the man. It was the cab driver, who’d taken him to Mr. Sinews’ house from Roderick’s. There was no sign of his fly.
It was clear that the cabbie was indeed dead. For a moment, Jonathan had wondered if he might merely be unconscious.
The man’s flesh was festering, rotten, the meat already beginning to slough off his bones. Raindrops struck his eyes, which were open to the elements. They were also vacant, grey and lifeless. Jonathan thought immediately of Lord Connor’s body. Monday had said that Connor had been sick. Was that what had happened to this man?
Then, the dead man blinked. Jonathan started. He reminded himself that he was under the influence of Mr. Sinews’ hallucinogenic absinthe.
He looked to Mr. Ocelot, who nodded.
“I saw it too,” said Henry Charles, and Jonathan realized he wasn’t hallucinating.
The dead man blinked again. This time, Jonathan was certain of what he saw. The dead man was waking up.
“Zombie.” Henry Charles’ voice seemed to echo, the word lingering in the air, as Jonathan gaped at the dead man. He recalled his conversation with Mr. Sinews, about the Resurrectionists, and their experiments with raising the dead. And their latest undertaking: Dead London.
“They’ve done it,” Jonathan breathed. “They’ve brought the dead back to life.”
“God help us,” said Henry Charles Ocelot. He staggered back as the dead man sat up, suddenly, and lunged toward them. “We’re too late.”</Text>

            <Synopsis>Hargrave dies with Roderick watching over him. Roderick has only one bullet left.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Roderick watched with tiring patience as Mr. Hargrave’s sickness took him. It might have been a matter of hours, or a matter of minutes; it was impossible to tell. A narrow gap in the wall, a mild breeze from outside, was the only indication of the passage of time. The thick fog and black clouds made the day as black as any night.
In all that time, the zombie mob still lingered in the hallway, voicing their hunger with the same desperate moans. No change had come over them.
But Hargrave had changed.
He had grown quiet and still. His eyes seemed to have sunken back in his head. Dark shadows crept across his skin, the necrosis spreading from his blackened wound and poisoning his entire body. The grey pallour that Roderick had first observed on the policeman’s arm was now the color of his neck, his face, his chest. His veins were black webs. A thin sheen of sweat clung to his forehead. His lips appeared chapped, the skin on them peeling away.
Roderick guessed he didn’t have long.
The gun was beginning to feel heavy in his hand. His wrist had begun to shake with fatigue. But still, he waited. He wasn’t about to kill the man while he still lived.
“Roderick,” Hargrave croaked. His voice was beginning to sound less human. It was the first time he had spoken in hours.
“Hargrave,” Roderick answered.
Hargrave tried to shift position, to sit up a bit straighter, and flinched. He coughed, a hoarse rasp of air expelled from black lungs through a tattered throat. At last, he settled. He forced a smile.
“Please,” he said, “Call me Richard.”
Roderick swallowed. He gave the man a nod, tears threatening to well up in his eyes. He blinked them back. He barely knew this man, but they had a hard-earned closeness, the brotherhood of having fought at each other’s sides. They had fought the living dead together, they had saved each other’s lives. And for the past few hours, Roderick had been sitting at his side, watching him die.
“Richard, then,” he said, and he forced a smile, and began to cry. He wiped his tears on his sleeve. “What is it?”
“Promise me—”
“Yes?”
Hargrave’s words were a whisper, the man’s dying words drowned out by the mob of the unliving outside the door. Roderick stood up from the bench and crossed the short width of the cell. He bent down and put his ear to Hargrave’s mouth.
“Promise you what?” he asked.
Hargrave had gone quiet. Even with his ear pressed against Hargrave’s mouth, he couldn’t hear a thing. And, he realized, he couldn’t feel the air of his breath. He couldn’t see the rise and fall of his chest.
He looked at Hargrave’s face. His eyes had fallen shut. His body was stiff, motionless. Roderick peeled off his gloves, set them on the floor next to his gun. With a shaking hand, he reached out to check his friend’s pulse.
He put his fingers against Hargrave’s carotid. His skin was cold, and lifeless. Roderick couldn’t feel a pulse. A hard knot formed in his throat. He swallowed it, and steeled himself for what he needed to do.
He reached for his gun, just as Hargrave’s eyes snapped open.</Text>

            <Title>Scene 4</Title>
            <Text>The moment she heard the click of the latch, she reached for her mask, and with deft hands, covered her face with it.
When she returned her attention to the door, a gentleman stood there watching her. The expression on his face was one of shock.
“My god!” he exclaimed at last.
“It’s not what it looks like,” said Annabel, still attempting to free herself from beneath Connor.
It was a compromising enough situation, dressed as a man, lying on her back beneath the body of a man. Perhaps she could catch the man off guard by selling him on the illusion that she and Lord Connor were sharing amorous and horizontal affections. That ought to shock the man into quitting the room in all haste, providing Annabel with sufficient time to make her escape.
Unfortunately, the man at the door was astute.
“It looks like you’ve just shot Lord Connor,” he said.
Annabel frowned.
“Oh,” she said in a voice that she hoped disguised her disappointment—or, at least—her femininity. “Then I suppose it’s exactly what it looks like.”</Text>

            <Title>Mr. Lockwood joined Professor Ashcroft at the window copy</Title>
            <Text>Henri-Charles joined Jonathan and Dr. Sound at the window, and looked out at the fearsome beast. The men stared in silence at the beast as it approached Gravesend. Ollie’s voice from the exterior of The Penny Dreadful broke the silence. Jonathan hurriedly made his way along the short hallway to the crew cabin, Henri-Charles and Dr. Sound following in his wake. They made their way through the cabin, barely causing the crewmen to turn their heads, busy as they were with their own work, and pushed open the hatch. A powerful gust of air whistled and howled its way into the cabin.
“Ollie,” said Jonathan, bracing himself against the railing.
“Good god, Cap,” said the pilot, shouting over the drone of the ship’s engines. “I never imagined—”
“Nor I,” Jonathan replied. “Let's take up our battle stations. Ollie, would you summon Miss Hattori? That woman is deadly with a cannon.”
“That she is,” said the pilot, and he reached for his communication device, which carried his command through the speaking tubes. Given that Kasumi was even more proficient with a weapon than with a wrench, Jonathan had insisted she take on an apprentice. “Graves, take over for Miss Hattori in the engine room. Worthington, take up position at the port side cannon.”
The din of machine gun fire and the sound of screams reached them. The enemy had reached Gravesend.
“Good god! They’re firing on civilians!” cried Dr. Sound.
One of the crewmen, presumably Worthington, took up his position at the cannon, while Henri-Charles took up the maxim gun. A moment Kasumi Hattori joined them on deck, her katana strapped to her back. Though she’d been alternating between duties as zombie hunter and engineer, she didn’t show the slightest sign of fatigue. Her eyes were fierce and fearless. “Let’s squash this bug.”
Henri-Charles was already settling in at the gun turret. Hurriedly, he began loading it with what appeared to be a lifetime’s supply of ammunition. He aimed through the weapon’s scope.
“Fire at will!” shouted Jonathan.
The big Haitian didn’t need to be told twice. Jonathan hung by the doorway and watched as the crewman held down the trigger and unloaded a hundred bullets into the abominable cockroach. He whistled in appreciation of the weapon.
Bullets bounced off the creature’s hard shell, each round as insignificant to the magnificent beast as a mosquito bite to a man. All they'd done was alert the bug to their presence. The beast whipped its frightful head around and looked straight at the Penny Dreadful. Its flight was clumsy, its maneuverability awkward. But that was hardly cause for comfort. They could see the Resurrectionists in the ship’s cockpit.
“I think they see us,” Jonathan remarked.
It flew toward them.
“Oh, god!” cried Dr. Sound, his eyes widening.
Henri-Charles unleashed another barrage of bullet fire, but the result was the same. Nothing.
“Evasive maneuvers!” bellowed Jonathan. He shouted into the communication device. “Bring her about!”
The sound of the creature’s outrage drowned out his words. Shrill, ear-shatteringly loud, and utterly unnatural.
Jonathan felt the ship start to shift direction, heard the ship’s sails unfurl. Too slow.
The creature’s antenna struck the side of the ship. Its impact shuddered through the craft. Wood shattered into pieces, and the world seemed to turn on its side. The clouds seemed to tip over like clumsy white sheep. Jonathan grasped a railing and held tight. His feet lifted off the ground, and his hand slid along the railing. His grip was tenuous, but with a grunt of effort he managed to swing his other arm around and get a hold of the railing. Finally, the ship righted itself.
“Everyone all right?” he heard Ollie shout.
“Fine,” he replied, though he felt like he might be sick. He hated flying, but he hated showing any sign of weakness in front of the airship crew even more. He looked to Kasumi, who seemed unfazed.
“I’ll take the starboard cannon,” she said.
“I’d hoped you would,” Jonathan answered. “Thanks, Kas.”
Keeping a hand on the railing, she took a moment to survey the aftermath of the creature’s attack. Then she headed for the cannon. Worthington was already readying a cannonball at the cannon opposite her.
Ollie was strapped in to his seat, and though he’d lost his hat, revealing a mess of dark brown hair, he appeared otherwise unharmed. Henri-Charles had likewise lashed himself down; even his hat was still on his head. As for the creature, Jonathan had lost sight of it. He whirled around. How can a creature that size just disappear?
From beneath the ship, he heard the heavy mechanical clicking of an enormous gun being reloaded. The enemy airship suddenly appeared in front of them, rearing its ugly head from below.
“Get down!” he cried.
The crew hit the floor. Bullets whizzed by the pilot's head, only narrowly missing him.
Jonathan couldn’t see if Kasumi or Henri-Charles had taken shelter, but he could hear bullets ringing off the dirigible’s armor, which suddenly seemed dangerously frail. He knew the armor wouldn’t hold out for long. And if the armor that covered the ballonets was penetrated, the hydrogen-filled ballonets could explode with just the slightest spark, engulfing them in flames.
It would slow them down, but at least that was better than being blown up. “Ollie!” Jonathan shouted. “The shields!”
“Aye, Captain! I’m a little busy!” Ollie shouted back.
It took a moment, but soon enough, a wall of plate metal swung up like hinged shutters to shield the balloons. Bullets pinged off the metal wall, ricocheting dangerously.
Jonathan took the opportunity to load his rifle. Jonathan’s father had once kept a sizable weapons collection aboard the airship, and since the fall of London, Jonathan had been doing his best to add to that collection.
“Dr. Sound,” he said, turning back to the scientist, who stood in the doorway. “I suggest you grab yourself a weapon. Whatever you think looks most dangerous, I suppose.”
“But I’m a scientist, not a soldier,” Dr. Sound protested.
“Yes, well, you’ll be a dead scientist if we don’t act,” Jonathan retorted. “Consider it an experiment. I hypothesize that if we put a whole lot of bullets in that thing, it will die. Now, let’s apply the scientific method to the situation.”
He grinned.
The sound of cannon fire deafened them both momentarily, but it was a reassuring sound. It meant that Kas was operating the cannon.
She was relentless, firing a second shot almost immediately after the first. The ship rocked with the boom of cannon fire. Her next shot managed to crack the creature’s chitinous shell, and the beast opened its fearsome maw and uttered its shrill, piercing cry.
Focus, Jonathan had to remind himself. Focus. While the monstrous beast appeared to have been wounded by Kas’s cannon fire, the Resurrectionists did not seem to care. The Resurrectionists were merciless as they continued to unleash a hail of bullets at the Dreadful and would probably do so until they ran out of bullets or took down the airship, whichever came first.
Jonathan watched as Ollie crawled along the floor, back to his position at the helm of the ship. If he hadn't been lashed down, he would surely have been tossed overboard.
"Ollie, stay down!" Jonathan shouted.
Ollie shook his head. "Then who's gonna fly this thing, Cap? I've got a ship to operate."
Jonathan had to admire that.
Another bullet pinged off the metal shields, followed by silence. "They're letting up!" Jonathan cried.
It was the Dreadful’s turn. Again the ship shuddered as cannonballs launched at the abominable cockroach and punctured holes into its carapace, not stopping it but at least doing damage.
Jonathan was determined not to be the weak link in the crew, in spite of his fear of heights. With his belly full of liquid courage, he headed out onto the bow of the airship, wind whistling through his hair. He braced himself against the railing and raised his pistol. He emptied the cyllinder, hitting the mark with every bullet fired, but that was little cause for celebration. Nothing seemed to hurt the creature. Even the barrage of cannon fire from Kas and Worthington had barely slowed the thing down.
He frowned. As he’d always said, the way to win a fight wasn’t simply to hit your opponent harder than he hit you; you had to hit where it hurt most. This monster was just like any other zombie, though. They could hack off all of its limbs, tear off its wings, and it might not even notice. The only way to stop it was with a headshot. Which was easier said than done, considering that its head was entirely safe beneath its thick shell of carapace, much like the rest of its body. Its weak point, then, was not its head. Its weakness was the control room housed in its body. Protected only by a pane of glass, this was where they needed to hit the beast.
“Ollie, tell them not to aim at the creature!” he shouted.
Ollie turned around and put a hand to one ear, miming that he couldn’t make out what he was saying. Jonathan swore under his breath. Of course not. Of course he couldn’t hear over the sound of bullets hammering against the ship's armor, or the shrieking of the blustering wind as they tore through the air at high speed. There was nothing for it but to get closer.
The unfortunate thing was, there was a length of the ship that was not shielded by the ship's armor. In order to reach Ollie, he would have to pass through it. He would be completely exposed to any stray bullets that might come his way.
He reached the edge of the armored section. It was only about a meter from where he stood to the next sheet of armor near the captain’s perch. He spared a glance up toward the monster, shivering against the frigid air. The beast was still flying steadily after them, while the Penny Dreadful was flying in reverse, keeping just out of its range. The onslaught of bullets had ceased for the moment, but already the creature’s guns were getting ready for a second go at them. If the second onslaught lasted as long as the first, they wouldn’t survive it. The familiar mechanical sound of gears clicking into place spurred him into action.
He dashed across the open expanse of the ship’s prow, leaving both the safety of the railing and the protection of the shields. The wind rushed up around his arms. Bullets splintered the wooden deck around him. He pushed himself to keep running and not look back.
At last he managed to reach Ollie’s post, and gripped the railing in front of him. He repeated his message, and the pilot looked at him like he was barking mad.
“Then where should they aim?”
“There!” he said, pointing at the ship’s control room. “Take out the Resurrectionists and there will be no one to pilot that thing.”
The pilot nodded. “Good thinking,” he said. “Consider it done.”
He began barking orders at the crew through his communication device. Another barrage of bullets struck the Dreadful, putting dents in her shields and drowning out the pilot’s voice.
“We can’t hold out much longer, Captain,” said Ollie.
“Just keep at it, Mr. Lockwood,” Jonathan replied.
Ollie nodded. “Aye, Captain,” he said, turning the steering wheel with expert precision.
The Dreadful returned fire. The next cannon blast struck glass. The Resurrectionists inside the control room flinched, and a spiderweb began to crack along the glass.
“Keep that up! It's armored glass,” Jonathan cried. “Hit it again!”
The enemy airship continued to fire back and didn’t let up. Their supply of ammunition couldn’t be limitless.
"They'll run out eventually, Captain, but we can't outlast them if we're trading bullet for bullet," said Ollie.
Jonathan nodded. "This battle's turned into a punching match, but at least we're punching back now. We just need to punch harder," he said. He reached for the communication device. “Don’t quit now!” he roared. “Hit them again!”
The cannons boomed, and the glass splintered further. This time it was the Resurrectionists’ turn to take evasive action. The giant insect turned, but it was already too late. The next cannon blast shattered the windshield, raining glass down on the town below.
“After them!” Jonathan shouted. “We have them now!”
Again, Ollie pulled at the steering wheel, yanking on a lever to control the airship’s rudder. He barked an order into the communication device, and the airship changed direction, the crew heroically springing to action, hauling on the lines and relying on the wind in the sails to give them a surge forward.
“Sir!” a voice shouted from somewhere behind Jonathan. The wind played havoc with the sound of voices, but as he turned around, he spotted Dr. Sound at the doorway. He mouthed a few words that Jonathan couldn’t make out, then raised his hands to reveal what he’d found in the weapon room. A pair of hand grenades.
Jonathan nodded. “That will do!” he shouted back. “That will do nicely!”</Text>

            <Text>The horse let out a huff of exertion as it cantered up a winding, gravel driveway. The entrance to the driveway was marked by a wooden sign, which hung smartly from a tall signpost, set between two tall statues of horses. Grimmer and Sons Publishing Inc, the sign read in a plain font carved into the wood.
Annabel was relieved to learn that the zombies weren’t as widespread as she’d first feared. Some areas of the city were overrun, while other places still remained utterly untouched. Fortunately, the Grimmer Company was in a part of the city that had not yet been ravaged by the living dead.
Annabel had chosen to follow a hunch. She knew that the Grimmer company owned several newspapers, as well as a number of imprints for penny bloods, society papers, and magazines. Many of these newspapers and imprints had their own offices. This was the company’s head office, and it was here, she suspected, that she would be most likely to find the mysterious Mr. O.
She thought of what he’d been wearing at Connor’s ball—a well-tailored suit in the latest fashion. She considered his manners, and the fact that he had received an invitation to Lord Connor’s ball in the first place. She thought of his airship. That he had been entrusted with the company airship suggested he held one of the top positions at the company. He was someone important, then. In all likelihood, therefore, he worked at the head office. It was possible he was one of the heads of the newspapers, which would mean that he probably worked at one of the smaller offices, and not here. Still, this was her best bet.
She hopped out of the hackney, paid the driver generously, and marched up the driveway. The Grimmer Company building was a broad, stern-looking building, all geometric lines and rigid, unshakeable brick. A broad staircase of white marble led to the front door. Annabel noticed a couple of tall, rectangular windows, which looked out onto the wide courtyard. Through the windows, she could make out the bustling workers hauling stacks of paper, working at typewriters, and operating the printing machines. She thought of the little boy in her neighbourhood, peddling papers in the zombie-infested streets. This would be a busy day for the newspaper company.
Annabel straightened out her dress, feeling suddenly self-conscious. She had worn her best for the visit. An ivory and olive corset imported from France, silk gloves trimmed with lace, an ivory blouse, and a jet black twill jacket with a shawl collar trimmed with lace ruffles. Too many ruffles, by Annabel’s estimation. She wore silk riding skirt—not that she expected to ride, but she felt that a divided skirt afforded her more maneuverability than a traditional skirt—and as usual, a gun belt, hidden from view. Annabel had a number of aliases aside from Miss Monday—including, of course, Mr. Monday—but she’d chosen to stick with the persona of a high society belle for this occasion. It would have been odd for a woman of a lower class than Mr. O to inquire after him, but for the well-to-do Miss Monday, it might be somewhat acceptable. She should have had a chaperone, but on a day like today, a lady without a chaperone hardly counted as gossip. She doubted it would even raise an eyebrow. Still, she felt more than a bit overdressed as she climbed the stairs and let herself in the front door.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Henry Charles Ocelot, Marianne Hatton, and Edward Steen search Trafalgar Square for any sign of Resurrectionists. They find one, but they’re too late. It is revealed that Ocelot and Hatton were the subjects of Dr. Allen’s experiments, and that they have unusual powers - Mrs. Hatton pyrokinesis, HC Ocelot shapeshifting.

Henry Charles shapeshifts and eats the Resurrectionist, but the unliving are already spreading through the Square. </Synopsis>
            <Text>Trafalgar Square was bustling, not merely with pedestrians, but also with pigeons, which hopped about on the ground, flapping their wings apprehensively every time Henry Charles Ocelot approached, retreating around him as he scanned the crowd for any sign of the Resurrectionists.
He was out of place here, a criminal among the well-to-do, at the edge of The Strand, adjacent to the National Gallery. But Henry Charles had a quiet confidence, a swagger to his walk, which masked his incongruity with the locale and his accomplices.
At his side stood a lady whose age and social position both exceeded Henry Charles’, an elderly widow who might not have paused to give him the time of day were it not for their shared circumstances, Mrs. Hatton. Across the Square by Nelson’s Column was the ever-disagreeable Edward Steen, who, like Henry Charles, was threading his way through the crowd, looking for any sign of a man in a plague doctor’s mask.
Present circumstances aside, Henry Charles and Marianne Hatton had something else in common. Past scars. Both had been victims of Dr. Allen’s experiments. It was their mutual survival of the Resurrectionist’s barbarous crimes that had drawn them to the Vigilance Committee and given occasion for their unlikely friendship.
“I don’t buy it. Not for one second,” he muttered as he stood on his toes to look over the crowd.
Henry Charles was a large man, both broad-shouldered and tall. On the tips of his toes, however, he could just barely see above the crowd. Too many tall hats upon the heads of the gentlemen to get a clear view.
“What don’t you buy, Mr. Ocelot? The zombie creatures Mrs. Grimmer described? The Hunting Society?”
“No, that I believe,” he said, taking her gently by the arm and leading her over to the steps of the National Gallery. “It's her intel I don't trust.”
“Hm,” said Mrs. Hatton.
“You disagree?”
“Henry,” she said—they were, after all, old friends by now—“You don't trust Mrs. Grimmer? Fine, I don't trust her either, to be honest. But let's face it. You and I, we don't trust anyone easily. She may have been lying, or she may have just been wrong, but I believe we have to try. After all, what if she's right?”
Henry Charles shrugged his massive shoulders, turning once again to look through the sea of pedestrian traffic. The pigeons hopped out of his way, as did the gentlemen and ladies, them no more elegantly than the pigeons. He couldn’t say he blamed them; he had a ferocious aspect. Thick, pink scars that ran down his dark skin. Chipped teeth, some capped with gold. One of his eyes a deep blood red. It was no wonder they feared him, though the truth was that of the pair of them, Marianne Hatton was the more dangerous.
They climbed the stairs and turned to look down upon the Square. They could now see Edward Steen pointing at something, waving with his other hand to get their attention. They followed his finger, squinting to see what he was looking at.
Even from here, it was difficult to see, but they could hear it. A wave of panic spreading through the crowd, emanating from the spot Steen was focus on. People fell away, screaming and shoving as they fought to get away. As they did, they revealed the source of their panic. A single Resurrectionist, with a large chest at his side. He was bent over, opening the chest, and extracting its contents one at a time.
“Are those crows?” said Mrs. Hatton.
They did appear to be crows, but they were made of brass and steel. Each time he took one out of the chest, he would turn a key upon its back, and its wings would start to whir. Then he’d let go, and the mechanical bird would start to fly, circling above the crowd.</Text>
            <Notes>“I don’t buy it. Not for one second,” he muttered as he stood on his toes to look over the crowd.

            <Title>Scene 56</Title>
            <Synopsis>Hargrave dies with Roderick watching over him. Roderick has only one bullet left.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The gunshot rang out through the hallways of the prison, a deafening sound like thunder reverberating in the small cell. The zombies seemed to be drawn to the sound, their efforts to get past the heavy door suddenly renewed. Roderick began to weep. He pounded his hands against Hargrave’s lifeless chest in frustration, dropping the empty pistol on the floor with a clatter.
“God damn you, Hargrave,” he cried. “Don’t leave me alone in here.”
His friend’s head was shot through, a clean hole through his forehead, a hideous snarl permanently held on his face, like the smile on a wax figure.
Roderick took Hargrave’s hat from his head, placed it over his face, and stood up. He couldn’t stand to look at him any more, and he found himself unable to tear his gaze away. Now that his face was covered, he was able to look away.
He dusted himself off, bounced on the balls of his feet to shake off the nervous energy, and pulled his gloves back on.
“Get a hold of yourself, Roderick,” he said aloud. He found that his nerves were steadier when he was talking aloud, even if there was no one to hear but him. He wished he had Bailey with him. Roderick was accustomed to spending nights alone in his studio, but at least then he had the dog to talk to. Now, there was nobody but the zombies in the hall and the corpses in the cell.
Remembering that he still had a bit of cocaine in his pocket, he reached into his jacket and pulled out a small bag of it. He dabbed a bit under his nose and inhaled. Almost instantly, he felt more himself.
For what seemed like the first time, he examined his cell. It was like seeing it for the first time. The bench he’d been sitting on, hard, weathered oak on legs of iron. The bare walls of cinder. The iron door to the dark hall outside the cell, the square grates in the door through which the dead thrust their fingers. The tattered bed-sheet on the floor. The thin opening in the wall through which the faint breeze found its way into his cell.
During one of Jack Sheppard’s escapes from Newgate, he’d filed away the iron bars on the door and climbed through the narrow space between the bars and into the hallway. With the aide of his female accomplices, he’d managed to slip past the distracted guards. Roderick, of course, had no accomplices, and his guards were a mob of a hundred ravenous corpses.
During another of Sheppard’s famous escapes, he’d gotten away by climbing through the window. He managed to scale the wall, climb up onto the roof, and later descended to the ground, using a rope made of bedsheets. Roderick might have gotten out that way, but the narrow window was blocked by an iron bar that was lodged into the cinder.
“That’s it!” Roderick cried, laughing aloud as he considered it. “Yes, that might just work.”
It was during Sheppard’s final escape from Newgate that he’d filed away the iron bar that obstructed his escape through the window. He’d used the iron bar to chip away at the ceiling, eventually managing to put a hole through it large enough to climb through. Once free of his cell, he’d gotten up onto the roof, used the blanket in his cell to reach the roof of the house across from the prison. He’d broken into the house, climbed down the stairs, and headed out to the street, all with with his irons still on his legs.
Roderick considered the possibility of his own escape. Being repelled by the thought of exercise, Roderick had virtually no muscle on his slight frame. Like Jack Sheppard, he was not overly tall, and certainly not athletic. Still, in some ways he might be well-served by his slight frame. At least the hole he’d need to put in the ceiling didn’t have to be terribly wide.
It might take hours, days even, but at least it gave Roderick a glimmer of hope. With enough luck, he might not actually die in here.
He fished a nail-file from one of his pockets—it never hurt to be prepared for cosmetic emergencies—and dragged the wooden bench over to the window. He climbed up onto the bench, and looked through the window.
His heart leapt.
He could see an airship floating outside the prison. Even through the dark and foggy air, he could make out the ship’s familiar shape, and the brightly painted logo on its blimp. Beneath that, the name of the ship was printed in blazing red letters.

            <Title>Scene Three</Title>
            <Text>Marianne Hatton’s arms went limp as she reigned in the pyrokinetic energy she’d summoned. Her eyes went blank. Sweat ran down her face. Wrapping his coat around his waist in a half-hearted attempt at modesty, Henry Charles went to her side, concerned she might lose consciousness. He put a hand upon her back. Though he had thick, calloused skin, the heat rising off of her scalded him, and he had to let go.
“I’m fine,” she told him, though she didn’t sound it. “Put some clothes on, would you? You’ll make a scene!”
He laughed, his voice a deep baritone. That she could still be concerned about propriety at a time like this was a good sign. He picked his trousers up off the ground and pulled them on hastily. Mrs. Hatton was too exhausted to rely on her gift again, at least until she’d had time to recover, and he would be unable to shift again for some time. The zombies, on the other hand, had not all perished in the heat.
There were gentlemen walking about, every inch of their skin burned, the charred remains of their clothing still smoking. Some of them were still on fire, yet they seemed not to notice. Their attention was focused on their hunger. The creatures were beginning to disperse, spreading out into the street, past the staircase that led to the National Gallery, away from Trafalgar Square.
As they watched, a carriage was forced off the road by the roaming mob. The horse went wild, somehow managing to detach from the cart in its panic. The driver was quickly ravaged. Soon enough, he joined their number, climbing onto the cab in their effort to get at the passengers.
“We should help them,” said Mrs. Hatton, her voice weak.
“It is too late for them,” he said, and he was right. A moment later, the door was pulled off its hinges, and the screaming passengers were pulled out of the cab. Blood and gore spilled onto the streets and into the gutters. “We must worry about ourselves.”
She nodded, fanning herself while he quickly finished shuffling back into his clothes. A scattered few of the living dead made their way towards them, but they were slow-moving, all but burnt up in the fire, some of them crawling upon the ground, unable to stand.
More alarming was that the police had arrived, treating the affair as they might a riot, their guns and batons trained on the zombies, shouting orders for them to disperse. When the zombies instead turned on the officers, they began firing. Their shots were panicked and badly aimed. Most went wild.
They heard the screams of policemen as the zombies tore into their flesh. One of the officers pointed his gun at Marianne and Henry Charles.
"Stop!" Henry Charles shouted. "We're not like them."
He put his hands up, but the officer must have been too panicked to discern living from zombie, to notice that he and Mrs. Hatton were innocent bystanders.
His first shot went wild. Henry Charles didn’t wait for a second shot, instead running for cover. A second shot rang out, then a third. He was still out in the open, exposed. He didn’t dare look back, even to see if Mrs. Hatton had been hit.
He ducked beneath a low wall of stone that surrounded the square. Bits of stone exploded above his head, the bullet ricocheting off the wall. Mrs. Hatton ducked down right beside him.
“Are you hit?” he asked.
“No,” she said, breathless. “But you nearly were.”
She snatched the top hat off his head and showed it to him. There were bullet holes through either side of it. His eyes widened. Close call. She gave him the hat back.
“Where to?” she asked, staying low and crawling along the wall.
“We were supposed to rendezvous with the Penny Dreadful crew in front of Big Ben.”
When he noticed that nobody was shooting at them any more, he lifted his head above the wall and looked down on Trafalgar Square. The zombies were gone, a trail of death in their wake. The charred remains of the many Mrs. Hatton had dispatched still smouldered, though the fires had begun to die. Blood and human limbs spattered the ground. A pair of chewed up legs here, a hand there, a boot with a foot still in it.
As for the policemen, they had either retreated or joined the ghastly pilgrimage. Henry Charles suspected the latter.
“This city’s going to hell,” he said, his voice grim.
“I don’t suppose we’re going to find a cab,” Mrs. Hatton replied.
Her face was pale and flushed, but she kept the fear and shock out of her voice. She was a tough old woman, Henry Charles knew. After all, she’d survived Dr. Allen’s experiments.
“Guess we’d better start walking,” she said. “It’s not far from here.”
Henry Charles nodded.
"I was right, by the way. About Mrs. Grimmer's intel. We should have had time to stop this."</Text>

            <Title>Scene 57</Title>
            <Text>The blood seemed to have stopped flowing. Annabel had roughly patched Palmer up with a strip of cloth from her skirt. It was badly ripped enough already, so she dared not worry about the scandal her bare legs might cause should she be seen in public in such a state. There were other, more pressing concerns. Besides, given the state the city was in, it was unlikely that she would be the only one with a torn skirt.
“We’ve got to get out of here,” she said. “The Resurrectionists could be right on our heels.”
Palmer agreed with a groan of pain. “This isn’t the only way out of the lab, either,” he said.
He hurried to the door, stopping only to retrieve another weapon, a shotgun he had hidden beneath his desk. Annabel had to remind herself that if he’d wanted to kill her he wouldn’t have needed the shotgun to do so. He could just as easily have left her to the Resurrectionists. Or he could have kept his pistol to himself. Still, she didn’t trust him, so she positioned herself so that Jonathan Grimmer stood between her and Palmer.
She had only just met Jonathan the night before. He’d given her little reason to trust him. He’d provided a false identity. He’d known that Lord Connor was a Resurrectionist; he’d said that Connor had dangerous friends. His family was obviously connected with the Resurrectionists, and now she’d caught him wearing a plague mask, down in the Resurrectionist’s secret laboratory. Everything she knew about him screamed Resurrectionist. And yet…and yet, he’d stood by her, on lookout while she cracked Connor’s safe.
Annabel had survived in a dangerous world of criminals because she had good instincts. She didn’t trust easily. In all her life, she could only think of one time when she’d trusted the wrong man—but that single black stain on her record was Anthony Tidkins. A great whopping mistake in judgment. She couldn’t afford to make that mistake again. She couldn’t afford to trust Jonathan Grimmer.
“I don’t know why I trust you,” she whispered to him. The truth was, when she looked into Jonathan’s eyes, the only thing she could think to do was to kiss his lips, to lose herself in his embrace. No wonder she trusted him. “But I do,” she continued. “I don’t trust Palmer.”
“I do,” he said.
Annabel bit her tongue, and nodded. “That will have to do,” she said, “for now.”
She turned to Palmer, stopping him before he left the room.
“I need more bullets,” she said, holding up the gun he’d loaned her.
He returned to his desk, and opened another drawer. He rummaged through it, fished out a small stash of nine millimeter ammunition, and handed it over.
“Most of the offices don’t have elevators into the basement. Just those of us who worked in the laboratory before the Resurrectionists took it over,” Palmer told them, as he crossed the room to the door. “Mrs. Grimmer’s office, mine, and Charles Grimmer’s old office—Jonathan’s now. Mr. Grimmer’s office is closest to this one; they’ll likely be headed there. Follow my lead.”
“Right,” said Annabel, opening the door and heading into the hallway in a hurry.
The employees of the printing company stared at them as the trio tore down the hall. They made quite the sight—Annabel with her tattered dress, Palmer with his bandaged wound, and Jonathan with his customary roguish smile still on his lips. The gossip, however, quickly turned to stunned silence, when the crowd noticed Mr. Palmer’ shotgun and Annabel’s pistol.
Without slowing, the trio hurried through the crowd, the shouts of the Resurrectionists announcing their arrival from behind. Barely pausing in his tracks, Palmer cocked the shotgun, aimed it at the Resurrectionists, and fired.
Screams erupted from the printing company’s employees, while a cry of pain arose from one of the masked Resurrectionists. The Resurrectionists scattered for cover, though some of them raised their own weapons and began firing back. The chaos of screaming journalists, secretaries, and printers provided cover, while Annabel fled through the crowd, Jonathan and Palmer right behind her. After a moment, the Resurrectionists resumed the chase.
They sprinted around the corner as a bullet tore a hole in the wall, plaster and dust sprinkling the floor. They hurried through the printing room, shoved open the door to the lobby. Past the startled receptionist, toward the front door. They shoved it open, and tore down the front steps.
The Grimmer Company was clear of zombies; clearly, the Resurrectionists hadn’t wanted the dead to interrupt their work, so they’d avoided spreading the Lazarus Virus within the vicinity of the lab. Annabel wondered how long it would take before even this neighborhood was overrun by zombies. How long, without the aide of the infectious gas, would it take for the plague to spread?
Annabel spared a glance back. The Resurrectionists were just now arriving in the lobby.
“Come on!” she cried, hiking up her skirt and heading down the long driveway of the printing company.
The men didn’t need to be told twice. They quickly hurried after her, with only the occasional backward glance to see that, yes, they were still being followed.
Another shot rang out, but it went wild. Palmer returned fire, forcing the Resurrectionists to take cover while the trio fled. They sought cover behind a statue that marked the entrance to the driveway. A hail of bullets struck the statue, and Annabel had to cover her ears and eyes as the stone crumbled.
Palmer reloaded, stepped out from behind cover, and fired again.
“Go!” he shouted.
Annabel didn’t hesitate. She headed out onto the street. Jonathan was right behind her as she hurried across the deserted road, bullets bouncing off the ground inches from his feet. It was only by luck that he wasn’t hit. They took cover behind a tree. A bullet lodged in the thick trunk, bark filling the air.
The neighborhood was dead quiet, but for the shower of bullets; Annabel could spy fearful faces peering out of the windows at her and Jonathan. Probably wondering if she and Jonathan were zombies.
“We’ll have to go on foot,” she said. She’d hoped they might flag down a passing hansom and hop on before the Resurrectionists had a chance to follow.
Jonathan was scanning the sky. “Shit,” he swore. “Where is it?”
“Your airship?” she asked, still running.
Palmer was hurrying after them, at a distance. They slowed to allow him to catch up. Another bullet zinged past, shattering a window. Another one struck the pavement, creating a spray of debris. They ducked into an alley.
“We’ll be safer in the skies,” Jonathan whispered quickly. “I sent some of my crew on a bit of an errand. I’d hoped they would be back by now.”
Annabel risked a peak, and saw that the Resurrectionists were still following. They had split up, though, half of them heading away from them, the rest headed their way. They might not have seen them flee into the alley, but they would round the corner in a moment. Then they’d be sitting ducks.
“We need to keep moving,” she said, taking off down the alley. “Where are we headed?”
“Newgate,” he answered.</Text>
            <Comments>What caliber?

Huh?  "Tore down the trio"?

Huh?  "shoved open the halls"?</Comments>
            <Notes> She headed towards the street, waving her arms to try to flag down a passing cab. She looked back to Mr. Palmer, who was now running after her again, bullets bouncing off the ground mere inches from his feet. It was only by luck that he wasn’t hit.
Finally, Annabel managed to flag down a driver. He pulled the fly off to the side of the road, and she climbed inside, making room for Mr. Palmer, who practically dove into the coach.
Annabel belted out instructions to the driver, not worrying about where they were going, so long as the cab was moving. The Resurrectionists’ bullets had not proved to be terribly accurate, but they did seem to have considerable range. It was not until the fly turned down a side street that Annabel settled into her seat.
“Are you hit?” she asked Mr. Palmer. “Again, I mean?”
He shook his head. “Other than the shoulder, I’m fine,” he said. “Where are we headed?”
“Where would we find Mr. O?”
“Who?”
“Jonathan, I mean,” she said. “Mr. Grimmer.”
Abraham turned to the driver and rattled off the address of the Grimmer family household. Then he turned back to Annabel. The firearm he’d given her was now aimed at his stomach.
“I believe you promised me an explanation,” she said. “I want to know why you’re helping me. Tell me everything.”
Mr. Palmer nodded slowly. “I will,” he said. He indicated the driver with a nod of his head. “But not here. Not now.”
Annabel pursed her lips unhappily. With a subtle nod of her head, she reminded him that he was at gunpoint. “When?” she demanded, jamming the muzzle of the rifle into his gut.
He winced in pain.
“When we arrive at Mr. Grimmer’s residence, I’ll explain everything to the both of you, if that’s agreeable.”
Annabel nodded.
“Fine,” she said, “But no more secrets.”</Notes>

            <Title>Scene Two</Title>
            <Text>“Why does it smell like fresh bread in here?” Annabel asked now.
The scientist, persuaded by his belief that Mr. O was Charles Grimmer, had taken them down the long hallway, all the way to its end, and with a key that hung from his belt, had let them in. It was here, he’d told them, that they’d find their answers. “Well, some answers, at any rate,” he’d added.
Annabel had readily agreed. Anything to change the subject, really.
She wasn’t ready to talk about Jack. Not yet. As far as memories went, she preferred the one with the bread.
“Must be baking again,” said the scientist, sniffing. “I know, it’s a bit strange, having an oven down here. But we wanted him to feel as comfortable as possible. We built this space to look as much like a real home as possible.”
“Whose home?” said Mr. O, “Who lives here?”
It really was built to look like a home. Much like the office they’d been in earlier, there were windows along the walls, curtained to give the impression that they were not so deep underground. But this place took the illusion to the extreme. Hardwood floors lined with Persian rugs, tall ceilings, bookshelves filled with literature, Renaissance paintings on the walls. Even a staircase which seemed to lead to a second story. Annabel wondered if it really was a multi-levelled home.
“Ah, Dr. Simms.”
An elderly man approached from the kitchen. He had a sickly complexion, his skin tinged yellow, his posture hobbled by sickness. He was thin, too, and crossed the room leaning heavily upon his cane, though his eyes were bright and sharply focused on his guests. As he crossed the room, a gentle smile on his face brightened his face. A servant, at his side, wheeled a tall cylindrical device alongside. A series of tubes stuck out of the cylinder, connected to an oddly shaped leather mask.
“And I see you’ve brought guests.”
“George, you remember Charles? And…” Dr. Simms paused. “No, that’s not right. This is Jonathan Grimmer, isn’t it? Yes, Jonathan Grimmer. And Miss Monday.”
Annabel winced. So he did know her. It would have been better if he didn’t. They’d already heard Mrs. Grimmer talking of using her in some way, and even if Mrs. Grimmer was on their side, that didn’t sit well with Annabel.
“A pleasure to meet you both,” said the old man. “My name is…well, I’m better known by my pseudonym. Dr. Allen.”
Annabel blanched. This old man is the head of the Resurrectionists? The man supposed to have committed numerous atrocities in the name of science, chopped women and children into pieces and put them back together again? Only, according to Dr. Simms, he’d been under the influence of a serum that had messed with his mind.
Mr. O actually laughed.
“You? Dr. Allen? Really?”
The old man sighed. He settled slowly into an armchair with the aid of a servant, who took his cane and set it nearby. He began to cough, lightly at first, but it soon developed into a fit of coughing that wracked his entire body. His servant handed him a handkerchief to cough into. When at last he pulled it away, it was stained with blood.
“It’s getting worse,” said the servant, handing him the leather mask.
“Not now,” the old man told him, dismissing him with the wave of a hand. To his guest, he said, “My apologies. Have a seat, won’t you?”
A bit unsettled, Annabel took a seat on the divan, while Mr. O and Dr. Simms shared seats on the couch.
“Tea?” he offered.
Annabel nodded. Might as well get comfortable, even if the man was reputed to be a mass murderer. Dr. Allen nodded at his servant, who left the room to fetch the niceties. Tea and biscuits were provided, the servant dismissed, and the unlikely party settled in to hear what Allen had to say.
“My reputation precedes me,” he observed. “What you must think of me.”
Annabel took a bite of the shortbread. Another memory there, but her attention was fixed on the supposed devil doctor.
“Dr. Simms told us that you were under the influence of a serum, created by a man named Anthony Tidkins,” said Mr. O.
“Let’s not use pseudonyms,” he said. “Anthony Tidkins’ real name is Jack.”
Annabel started. She put a hand to her eye, and thought of Dr. Simms’ words. He’d said that her eye was Anthony Tidkins’ handiwork, but she’d dismissed it as the ramblings of a madman. After all, it was Jack that made her clockwork eye.
Dr. Allen smiled ruefully.
“Anyway, that much is true. I was under the influence of Jack’s serum, a concoction of neurotoxins and poisons that can induce susceptibility to suggestion, erratic and unpredictable behaviour and memory loss among the more potent side effects. Which is not to say that I should be absolved of all guilt in the crimes I committed. I would never have done what I did without the serum’s influence; however, I am responsible for Jack. I must therefore accept that whatever accusations you wish to lay upon me are at least in some part true.”
“How so?” Annabel demanded.
“I was Jack’s mentor,” he replied, smiling sadly. “He wasn’t always so disturbed. Once, he was just a young, inquisitive mind. It was under my tutelage that his mind developed into an instrument of science, under my mentorship that Jack became what he is today.”
“And what is he?” said Mr. O.
Dr. Simms sat forward.
“The Resurrection Man,” he said, suddenly shouting with excitement.
He bobbed up and down in his seat. Faster and faster, Dr. Simms began to talk, while Dr. Allen attempted to quiet him.
“The Resurrectionists were Jack’s vision. A collective of like-minded scientists who dreamed of elevating science beyond what it once was, putting it above ethics and morality. You want to vilify him, but Jack’s studies are important enough to justify Dr. Allen’s crimes, committed as a result of Jack’s serum. His vision depended upon the assistance of London’s most prominent scientists, not all of them loyal to the Resurrectionists. The serum, therefore, represents collaboration!”
“I’m sorry,” said Annabel, “I don’t understand. What is Jack’s vision? What is he studying?”
“I believe you already know,” Dr. Simms replied, looking at her with a ferocity in his eyes that hadn’t been there a moment earlier.
Still, Dr. Allen was attempting to quiet the other doctor. Eventually, he turned his attention to Mr. O.
“Jack is insane. That isn’t to say that his work isn’t of value, as Dr. Simms suggests, but his work is also incredibly dangerous. He’ll go to any length to achieve his goals, even if that means infecting civilians with the Lazarus Virus.”
“Why don’t you stop him?” asked Annabel.
“You can’t stop Jack!” shouted Dr. Simms.
Dr. Allen looked pityingly at the other doctor, then back to Jonathan.
“What can I do? The Resurrectionists have begun to revere Jack as a god. Symptomatic of the serum.”
Mr. O exchanged a look with Annabel.
“Yet you seem to remain immune,” Mr. O observed.
“The serum’s effects are not permanent. It must be administered regularly. Perhaps for sentimental reasons, or perhaps because I’m too sick and frail to do much harm or to be of much use, Jack has not been dosing me with his serum.”
Assuming he was telling the truth about all of this, Annabel suddenly found that she had more questions than answers. At the very least she now knew where to direct her vengeance. Jack. But she wasn’t about to act blindly. She still wasn’t sure what to make of this. It was easy to be taken in by Dr. Allen’s unassuming, grandfatherly appearance, and the smell of freshly baking bread, but Annabel had long ago learned that appearances weren’t everything.
“The truth is that The Resurrectionists are not a scientific society,” said Dr. Allen. “They’re a cult.”
Dr. Simms opened his mouth to protest, but Allen cut him off.
“They keep me down here, provide me with all the comforts of a home, not to protect me as Dr. Simms might have you believe, but to shut me up.”
“But,” Mr. O began.
His tea was getting cold, as was Annabel’s, but he seemed hardly to have noticed that he’d been holding his cup in his hand without drinking a sip all this time.
“My parents. You expect me to believe that they were complicit in all of this? In this cult? That they built this underground facility to protect a murderer and his followers?”
Dr. Allen shook his head.
“No, Jonathan,” he said. “Your father had this complex constructed for an entirely different reason. Originally, it served as a headquarters from which to fight back against the threat of the infected dead. These creatures, unbeknownst to the general populace, have been running amok in this city for many years. Your father was the founder of an underground society that hunted them in secret.”
“My father secretly hunted zombies?” Jonathan scoffed.
Annabel exchanged a look with Jonathan.
“Ever since you were a young boy,” said Dr. Allen, grasping Jonathan’s use of the word zombies.
After another fit of coughing, his servant offered him the mask again. This time he accepted the offer, and fit the mask over his mouth and nose. He breathed sharply, and there was a strange sound of air puffing into the mask, and the hiss of oxygen pumping through the tubes. After a pause, he continued, returning the mask to his manservant.
“It is only due to your father’s efforts that incidents have been few and far between, and that the contagion has remained more or less contained. It was only after your father’s recent death that the Resurrectionists managed to take control of the facility for their own purposes.”
“What purposes?” asked Annabel.
“What about my mother?” Mr. O demanded.
Allen attempted to address both questions, in turn.
“Your father wanted to stop the spread of the Lazarus Virus, the contagion that causes the dead to rise. Jack wants the opposite. He wants the virus to spread throughout London. As does your mother.”
“Bullshit,” Mr. O argued, setting his cup of tea back down upon the side table. “No, she wouldn’t do that.”
Annabel let her eyes wander from Dr. Allen to Mr. O. She considered, not for the first time, the theory that Mrs. Grimmer was infiltrating the Resurrectionists from the inside. If she were in Mrs. Grimmer’s position, she would not have trusted Dr. Allen with her secret, so she decided not to contradict him, even if for Mr. O’s benefit.
“I’m sorry,” said Dr. Allen. “But Mrs. Grimmer is every bit as invested in Jack’s vision of as Jack himself. You asked me why I don’t stop Jack? I told you that I can’t. Not from in here, not in my condition. Not without your help.”
Annabel nodded. She stole a glance at Mr. O, who looked uncertain. Not that she blamed him, given what they had been led to believe about Dr. Allen. She had her own doubts as well, but there was a ring of truth to what he said.
And much as she would like to deny Jack’s involvement, the truth was that she did know what Jack had been studying. There was a connection she’d been trying to make, a thought nagging at the back of her mind. The voice of the Resurrectionist who’d robbed her of the prize taken from Lord Connor’s safe. She’d thought he’d sounded familiar. Suddenly she made the connection. It was Jack.
He was the bastard that hired her to rob Lord Connor, the son-of-a-bitch who had robbed her in turn, the villain who had spread Lazarus at the masquerade, the murderer who had taken Bertrand Melbourne’s life and taunted her with Poe. Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee. He’d made it look like Dr. Allen’s work in order to throw the police off the trail, and he’d gotten rid of another enemy in the process; Parson Sinews, the man who’d formed the Vigilance Committee formed to catch the Resurrectionists, had been arrested for Dr. Allen’s crimes. There was no doubt that this had been part of Jack’s plan.
Jack had to be stopped, even if that meant listening to Dr. Allen. It didn’t mean that she trusted him. Only that she believed at least some of what he’d told her.
“How do we help?” she asked.
Dr. Allen’s eyes crinkled with a smile.
“I’m not sure,” he admitted. “To be entirely honest, I’m a bit cut off from the Resurrectionists’ activities. They consult me, from time to time, for my scientific knowledge. But there are only two people who have all the details for the Dead London Project. The first is Jack. The other is Mrs. Grimmer.”
Mr. O’s hands clenched into a fist, but he kept his mouth shut.
“My ears must have been ringing. I thought I heard you talking about me, Dr. Allen. Oh, hello Jonathan. Dr. Simms. And who’s this young lady?”
Annabel swung around. She hadn’t heard the door swing open, but she recognised the voice. It was the voice she’d heard earlier, when she and Mr. O were hiding in the supply closet. Mrs. Grimmer herself.
She was an imposing figure. While Mr. O was small of frame but with an athletic build, his mother was impressively tall, especially for a lady. She smelt of perfume, and was dressed expensively, her greying hair pulled back neatly, beneath a wide-brimmed, lace-trimmed hat. There was a swish of fabric and the jangle of jewelry as Mrs. Grimmer let the door shut and marched into the room.
“Miss Monday, I presume?”
Dr. Allen ignored the intrusion, and hurriedly finished his thought. “I don’t know what you can do to stop them. But if you want my advice, just keep digging.”
Mrs. Grimmer took a seat in the remaining armchair, her wrath simmering just beneath the surface. Mr. O had an expression of shock written on his face. Annabel almost felt bad for him. She couldn’t have imagined what it would be like to learn that your mother was, well, evil.
If the woman really wasn’t a Resurrectionist, she was doing a damn good job of hiding that fact.
“Speak of the devil,” said Annabel.</Text>

            <Synopsis>The group looks for Mrs. Grimmer. Ultimately, they’re unable to find her, and they are forced to retreat.</Synopsis>
            <Text>“Where’s Palmer?” Jonathan asked as Miss Monday cleaned the gore from her mechanical arm with her surgical knife. She wound her gears yet again, and gave her fingers an experimental turn. She clenched and unclenched her fist.
Satisfied, they headed back into the hall.
Roderick took up the rear, watching their backs while Jonathan took the lead. Miss Monday stood at his side, ready with a surgical knife in case they ran into zombies. For the most part, it seemed that the zombies had all been dealt with. The floor was littered with their bodies, however. Jonathan kept a cautious distance from them, half expecting the dead bodies to twitch back to life and grab him by the legs.
“Dead,” Miss Monday said, answering Jonathan’s question coldly.
Jonathan didn’t know how to respond. On the one hand, Palmer had betrayed them. On the other, Jonathan couldn’t help feeling sentimental.
Miss Monday seemed to grasp Jonathan’s grief. Her voice warmed. “I’m sorry. I know you trusted him, but there’s something you should know—”
“I know,” Jonathan replied. “That’s why I was held up. Palmer knocked me out. He said he was going to try to stop you. I was worried he might have hurt you.”
“He damn well tried,” she said.
She held up a finger for silence as they rounded the corner. Jonathan marvelled at the movement of her mechanical hand. She had discarded her blood-soaked jacket, and the sleeve of her blouse had been torn, offering Jonathan a rare opportunity to see her bare prosthetic arm. He knew that she was self-conscious about it; he reminded himself not to stare. She gestured that the coast was clear, and Jonathan followed her into the next hall.
Suddenly, he felt something grab him by the ankle. He looked down and saw that one of the zombies he’d assumed was dead was still moving. The creature’s mouth had been torn clean off, but somehow it was still alive. It tightened its grip on Jonathan’s ankle. Even a scratch could prove deadly, even if the zombie couldn’t bite him.
Jonathan reached for his gun, but Miss Monday was already there with her surgical knife, dealing with the zombie. She drove the blade into its brain through the gaping hole where its mouth used to be. Its grip loosened.
“Come on,” she said. “We need to find your mother.”
“After Palmer helped you escape, they may have suspected she was unloyal, in which case they would have put her in the holding cells where they put you and Parson Sinews,” said Roderick.
Annabel nodded. “The cells are this way, if I remember from Palmer’s map.”
“I’ve already been by the cells,” Jonathan said. “I saw them hauling Sinews off. My mother wasn’t there.”
Roderick swore. “Where else could she be?” he wondered aloud.
“They might already have her in Chateau d’If,” Miss Monday answered.
“I hate to say this, but right now we’ve got other problems,” said Roderick.
Jonathan followed his gaze. His heart sank. Just how many zombies were the Resurrectionists keeping down here? He’d truly thought they’d already dealt with the last of them, but another mob of hundreds was marching down the hall, headed their way.
At the front of the mob was the largest man Jonathan had ever seen. At least eight feet tall, broad-shouldered, and muscular, it was impossible to tell if he was man or zombie; he wore a Resurrectionist mask over his face.
“Mr. Hyde,” said Miss Monday. Apparently this was not her first encounter with this behemoth.
“The Irish Giant,” Jonathan muttered.
Parson Sinews had mentioned him. Tidkins’ hired muscle, the man who had brought Tikdins fresh bodies to practice his experiments on. If he was a zombie, he would be near impossible to kill. His head was protected by the thick leather mask. Anything short of a bullet to the head would be ineffective, and aside from blunt weapons and blades, they were unarmed. Even if he wasn’t a zombie, he would be equally dangerous.
“We’ve got to run,” said Roderick.
“But my mother,” Jonathan protested, but his resolve was already weakening. He had no idea where to find her, and they couldn't face this many zombies.
Zombies were slow, for the most part, but some of the fresher ones could be surprisingly quick. The quickest of the dead surged past Mr. Hyde, and practically sprinted towards them.
“If she’s still alive, she’s probably in Chateau d’If,” Miss Monday said urgently. “Jonathan, we’ve got to run.”
As if to hammer home her point, one of the zombies dove at them. Miss Monday drove her knife into its head and stepped aside as its body hit the floor.
With that, Jonathan turned and ran. The quicker zombies were still hot on their heels. If they slowed down, the zombies would be upon them in an instant.
“Which way?” Jonathan called.
Roderick paused to draw his swordstick and deal with one of the zombies that had gotten too close for comfort.
“Right,” he answered, and tore down the hall after them.
They careened around the corner. Jonathan nearly slipped on the blood-slick floor, but somehow managed to keep on his feet. Ahead, they could see the spiral staircase that led to the library. A female zombie stood blocking their way. She was dressed in a dirty blue dress with a floral print, and had tubes stuck into her arms, dripping thick, resinous blood. A fresh experiment. She whirled when she saw them coming.
She snarled, and barefoot, ran towards them. She was quick, for a zombie, but Miss Monday was quicker.
“I’ve got this,” she said.
Her blade whirled, a swift flash of silver. Zombie blood hit the ceiling and splattered on the walls. The creature’s body lay still on the floor. Miss Monday turned and offered a grin.
“I’d hate to be on her bad side,” Roderick muttered.
Jonathan looked over his shoulder. No time to admire her handiwork. The dead were still on their heels, the Irish Giant among them.
“Hurry up, you two,” Miss Monday called, already stepping over the body and clambering up the stairs.
Jonathan didn’t have to be told twice. He raced to the staircase, and hurled himself up two steps at a time. He paused only to send a zombie careening back down the stairs with a kick to the chest. Finally, they reached the top of the stairs.
“How does this panel open?” Miss Monday asked.
“I don’t know,” said Roderick, “I only ever opened it from the other side. Try to find a lever or a switch.”
“There’s nothing,” said Miss Monday, searching frantically for a switch as she zombies resumed their climb up the stairs. Suddenly, the panel slid open. Miss Monday blinked in confusion. “That wasn’t me.”
They emerged in the library, and let the panel slide shut, trapping the zombies on the other side. Mrs. Thompson, the secretary, stood among the bookshelves, her hand on a copy of The Hunting Society, by Charles Grimmer.
“I heard your voices through the wall,” she said. “Thought I’d better let you in.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene 33</Title>
            <Synopsis>Annabel discovers the hidden elevator at the Grimmer Company headquarters</Synopsis>
            <Text>The foyer of Grimmer and Sons Publishing Inc. was quite unlike the rooms Annabel had spied through the windows as she’d approached the building. A wide room with dark, hardwood floors, bright wallpaper, and furniture lined with gilt, the foyer was the company’s public face. It stood apart from the printing and copying rooms that filled the rest of the building with the strong scents of glue, paper, and ink, and the the cacophonous din of printing machines and a hundred typewriters at work. It was quiet in the foyer; thick walls dulled the sound and the smell, but every now and then, a door swung open and one of the Grimmer employees headed through the foyer, and Annabel caught a glimpse of the printing rooms, and her ears rang with the thrum of machines.
A pretty, if bookish, young woman sat behind a desk, her hair tied in a neat bun atop her head. She stood up in alarm and made her way around the desk to greet Annabel as she came in. The poor woman seemed flustered by Annabel’s sudden appearance. Annabel wasn’t sure if this was because of the chaos caused by the zombie outbreak, or simply because Annabel was unexpected.
“May I help you, Miss…?”
“Monday,” Annabel offered. “And thank you, yes. Or at least, I hope so. I’m looking for a man…”
“Aren’t we all?” said the receptionist, and then caught herself. Her mouth widened in surprise, and she blinked in surprise as if she couldn’t believe what she’d just said. She covered her mouth with her hand. “I mean…I, well, I…”
Annabel spared her with a conspiratorial wink.
“Not just any man,” she said. “I’m looking for Mr. O.”
“Oh!” the receptionist replied, adjusting her spectacles to look at Annabel properly. To her credit, she managed to look at Annabel without appearing to stare at her clockwork eye or seeming to notice her scars. “Oh, I see. Let me guess, you’ve read an article of his that interested you?”
Annabel smiled. So Mr. O was a writer; already she was getting closer to learning his identity. This was proving to be easier than she’d thought.
“Actually,” she said, leaning in an putting her hand on the receptionist’s arm, as if they were old friends sharing secrets. “He and I were recently introduced at a party. I’m afraid I didn’t get his real name.”
“Oh,” said the receptionist, blushing. “Well, I can help you there. Mr. O is Jonathan Grimmer’s pen name.”
Annabel made an effort to keep her expression neutral as she took in the information. She’d been right about Mr. O; he was someone important within the Grimmer organization. He was a Grimmer!
“Does he have an office here?” Annabel ventured. “Would you let him know I’m here?”
The secretary gave a nod. She was ever so helpful, Annabel thought.
“Unfortunately, Mr. Grimmer hasn’t come in yet, this morning,” she said.
“I hope he’s alright,” Annabel said.
The secretary took her meaning. “People are being warned to stay in their homes, not to even open their doors,” she said. “It was awfully brave of you to venture out today.”
“Brave, or stupid,” Annabel said in a tone of confidence. “I simply refused to believe my butler when he said I couldn’t go out today. After all, how could I believe there were actually these hooligans and even cannibals roaming the streets in droves? I just put on my visiting dress and pouted until the poor man had no choice but to take me here.”
The secretary nodded, understandingly.
“Would you mind double checking? Perhaps Mr. O—sorry, Mr. Grimmer—came in the back door?”
The lady shook her head. “There isn’t any back door.”
“All the same,” said Annabel, “I’d hate to have come all this way for nothing.”
“Let me just take a look in his office,” she said, gesturing for Annabel to take a seat while she waited. There were a couple of chairs in the corner of the room, centred around a small coffee table with a couple of newspapers on top. “Can I get you something while you wait? Tea? Coffee?”
Annabel shook her head, but offered an appreciative smile. “Thank you, you’ve been very helpful.”
Annabel took a seat and waited until the receptionist headed out through the door on the left. The foyer was a symmetrical room, with a door on the left and a door on the right. As soon as the receptionist was out of sight, Annabel was out of her chair. She took a moment to rummage through the drawers of the reception desk. She stuffed a set of keys into her pockets, just in case they might come in handy. Then she headed to the door on the left.
It opened to one of the printing rooms. The printers seemed too absorbed in their work to even notice Annabel. The noise of the machines disguised the sound of the door opening, and those who happened to look up at Annabel’s entrance, quickly returned their attention to their work, too busy to bother with her. She looked down the hallway and saw the receptionist knocking on the door to one of the offices. She made a mental note of which door was Mr. O’s.
Annabel headed through the printing room toward the hallway, taking care not to be seen by the receptionist; suddenly her fancy clothes seemed incredibly conspicuous, even if they’d proved effective only a minute ago. She headed into the hallway, leaving the printing room behind. There were a number of offices along the way, each marked with a nameplate with the name and position of the employer whose office it was. She ducked into an alcove as the receptionist turned in her direction. She didn’t think she’d been seen, but she wasn’t sure.
She glanced at the nameplate on the door. This office belonged to Abraham Palmer, Assistant Editor. Annabel hoped he wasn’t in. It might be a bit awkward barging into his room unannounced, but better than being caught sneaking down the hallway by the receptionist. She tried the door, but it didn’t open.
Annabel cursed under her breath. The hallway wasn’t that long. If the receptionist was heading her way, she’d be on her in a moment. The alcove wouldn’t be deep enough to hide her when the receptionist was right beside her. She remembered the set of keys she’d tucked away in her pocket and hoped that one of them would open Mr. Palmer’s office.
She took out the ring of keys and tried the first. It didn’t fit. She swung the key along the ring, and tried the next. This one fit, but it didn’t turn the lock. She pulled the key from the lock. It was gold, had a round head, and was long. There were only three other keys on the ring that looked like it. She decided to try those next. She slid one of them into the lock. Again, it failed to turn. She could hear footsteps now, approaching. They must have been incredibly close, given that she could hear them above the din of the printing machines. She tried not to panic as she fit the next key into the lock. To her relief, it turned. She swung the door open, hurried into the room, and closed the door behind her, breathing heavily.
The room was dark, the lights off. Wherever Mr. Palmer was, at least he wasn’t in his office. Annabel took a moment to catch her breath, then turned to head back into the hallway. As she put her hand on the latch, she felt it turn. Someone was about to open the door, she realized.
Before they could open it, she clicked the lock back into place. Without a moment to lose, she reached up to adjust the dial on her clockwork eye so she could see more clearly in the dark. A green lens slid into place, replacing the opaque one that she normally used in daylight. She took in the details of the room, and quickly settled on a hiding place. A closet. She slid open the door and stepped inside, as a set of keys jiggled in the locked door. She slid the closet door closed, just as the door to the room opened.
She could see only through a slender crack in the closet door, but she could make out two distinct figures. She guessed that one of them was Mr. Palmer. The other was a woman. They were deep in conversation. Annabel held her breath and listened.
“Don’t say anything to Jonathan,” said the woman. “I don’t want him involved in any of this.”
The lights went on in the room. Even so, it was difficult to see through the crack in the closet door. The woman was standing by the bookshelf. Mr. Palmer was standing beside her. Their voices were all but drowned out by the thrum of machinery. There was a mechanical clang of steel and a rumbling in the floor that seemed to be coming from below. Perhaps there were more printing rooms in the basement.
“He’s already involved,” said Palmer. He had an American accent and a bit of a gravelly voice. Annabel guessed he was in his late fifties, judging from the voice. The woman was probably around the same age. “Everyone in this damned city is involved. Tidkins made sure of that when he began spreading the Lazarus Virus. I never thought…”
“Neither did I,” said the woman.
“Anyway, I have it on good authority that he was there,” Palmer continued. “He escaped via airship, but he was in the room with Lord Connor. They would have killed him if he wasn’t your son, you know.”
Annabel covered her mouth as she realized they were talking about Mr. O. It was difficult to think of him as Jonathan Grimmer. The woman, she guessed, was Jonathan’s mother, Mrs. Grimmer. And it sounded an awful lot like she was involved with the Resurrectionists. How else would she and Mr. Palmer know the Resurrectionists had seen Jonathan in Connor’s study? And why else would they have spared Jonathan for being Mrs. Grimmer’s son? How would they know so much about the Lazarus Virus, or Anthony Tidkins?
Annabel had come here to try to determine whether or not Mr. O knew anything else about Lord Connor. He had mentioned that Connor had dangerous friends. Annabel wondered if he knew who those dangerous friends were, as Annabel now knew they were Resurrectionists. She wondered if Mr. O—Jonathan—knew that his mother was also connected to these dangerous friends. She wondered if Jonathan was connected to them himself.
She couldn’t make out what Mrs. Grimmer said next. Her voice was drowned out as machinery rattled and clanged. It sounded like the printing machine was right inside the room.
As the noise died out and Annabel still couldn’t hear their voices, she realized they might have left the room. It became almost quiet, the only sound being the machinery from the adjacent room. Without opening the door, she couldn’t be sure they weren’t still in the room. But this might be her best chance to get out of here.
She counted to fifteen, then thirty, and still didn’t hear their voices.
At last, she opened the door. To her relief, they were gone.
But now there was a wide gap in the floor, and a tall structure of steel and brass rose up out of it.
“What on god’s green earth?” she muttered.
The structure was like a tall metal cage, cylindrical, with the missing section of the floor as its roof, beneath which was a dark shaft that must have led to the building’s basement. A cable ran down the shaft from the top of the metal cage, seeming to operate on a pulley system. The cable was running even now, the pulley revolving as the machine worked.
She could hear the sound, loud even against the din of the printing press from down the hall, of enormous gears turning from somewhere well below. It was almost like the sound of a clock tower, or the turning wheels of a locomotive. The mechanical clang of an enormous machine in operation.
“A secret elevator,” she realized, even as it descended.</Text>

            <Title>Scene Two</Title>
            <Synopsis>Roderick discovers Dr. Allen’s little home within the Resurrectionists’ facilities.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Having arrived in the identical office in the basement, Roderick took only a moment or two to investigate, but didn’t linger. Instead, he slipped off his shoes as was his custom, and headed into the hallway, acting as the tourist. If he happened to be discovered here, he would feign ignorance. Just looking for Mr. Grimmer. I have an appointment, he would say. But to his surprise as well as his relief, the hallway was deserted, at least for the moment.
A series of office doors lined the hallway. He memorized the names on the plaques on each of the doors, but walked past most without bothering to try the locks.
Abraham Palmer, Bartholemew White, Rémy Mills, each of these he past without pause. The door labeled Mrs. Elizabeth Grimmer was locked. He quickly passed the engineer’s office, instead pausing at the door of the Alpha Laboratory. It opened with a soft click.
He peered into the dark, and felt a chill as his eyes settled on a huge glass fish tank filled with murky water. Finding a gas lamp upon the table, he turned it on, and looking over his shoulder, stepped closer to the tank. He placed his hands against the glass and cupping his head in his hands, stared into the dark water. Flecks of meat and skin floated past his eyes. A human finger was settled at the bottom of the tank. It was otherwise empty.
He stepped back, feeling suddenly ill. He put a hand upon his stomach, and willed himself not to vomit. He cursed, glanced nervously around the room to ensure that he was still alone. In the hall, he heard voices.
Feigning ignorance if discovered here suddenly didn’t seem like an option. Whatever grim experiments took place in this secret laboratory, they were not meant for the prying eyes of the uninitiated. He scurried towards the door and pulled it closed as the voices approached. He dimmed the lamp and locked the door.
He held his breath as they drew closer. He’d known it would only be a matter of time before they followed him down here, but he hadn’t expected it to be while he was trapped in a room with a man’s finger in an enormous tank of water. He pressed his hand against his mouth to muffle the sound of his breathing, and listened.
Silence reigned. Then, the doorknob clicked. His heart pounded furiously, and he let out a startled gasp, barely muffled by his hand. The voices resumed.
“It’s locked,” he heard. The receptionist from upstairs, he thought.
“Well, open it!” A second voice, male, gruff and impatient.
“I don’t have a key,” said the receptionist.
“Of course you don’t,” said the man. “Bloody useless.”
The voices began to fade, signaling that they were walking away, perhaps to retrieve the key.
“Do you think he’s in there?” he heard, indistinct and distant.
“Doesn’t matter. We need to get out of here. All hell’s about to break loose.”
When the voices finally faded entirely, Roderick turned the light back on and unlocked the door. He couldn’t make sense of that last comment, but whatever it meant, he thanked his lucky stars that he’d not been caught. He opened the door and returned to the hallway, shutting the door with a shudder.
After that close call, he ought to have retreated. Any man with sense would have done so, if he’d been foolish enough to end up here in the first place. But he didn’t think he’d have another shot at this, and he wanted to uncover this mystery and catch The Resurrection Man.
So, he continued, navigating the labyrinthine halls. Once again, he began to hear voices from down the hall. This time, the voices were many, indistinct, almost inhuman. Then he heard gunfire. He chose his path by avoiding the voices. He walked past the cells of a jail, the doors open, the cells empty. Finally, the hall ended.
The door that stood before him was different from the others. Instead of a name upon the door, there was an address. 44 Allen’s Street, it read. As if things could not get more bizarre, a mailbox stood outside the door, and a welcome mat lay upon the threshold of the door. There was a brass knocker upon the door. Under less unsettling circumstances, he might have laughed at the absurdity. Instead, feeling a bit silly, he lifted the knocker, and used it to rap upon the door.
While Roderick was not one to read penny dreadfuls, he was familiar enough with the story of Dr. Allen to understand the reference to 44 Allen’s Street. After all, his father had followed the case almost obsessively. It was how Roderick knew of the Resurrectionists. 44 Allen’s Street was supposed to be the address of Dr. Allen.
The door swung open. An elderly man stood before him. He looked sickly, almost emaciated, his skin jaundiced. He leaned upon a cane for balance, and breathed through a leather mask with tubes connected to a steel cylinder.
“Dr. Allen,” said Roderick. It was not a question. This was definitely him. It was no wonder the police had never caught him, if this was where he was hiding out. Roderick was clenching his fist. Though he was old and sick, there was no escaping what he’d done. He cut people into pieces and put them back together again, turned them into automatons, and called it science. “You utter fucking bastard.”
“Ah, I wasn’t expecting company,” Dr. Allen replied, ignoring the slight. “To whom do I owe the pleasure?”
“Roderick Steen. Sir,” he sneered. He unsheathed his swordstick, pointed it at the murderer, and forcibly entered the faux house.
“And what can I do for you, Mr. Steen?” said the old man, wheeling his oxygen tank backwards as he retreated into his living room. He took a seat with a resigned sigh.
“I want answers,” he said.
“Very well. Shall I make us a pot of tea while we sit down to talk?”</Text>

            <Title>Scene 58</Title>
            <Synopsis>Roderick works on his escape, while Kip Lockwood and the Dreadful crew infiltrate the prison. They manage to get Roderick out, leaving a pile of zombies in their wake.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Having managed to file the iron bar from the window, Roderick applied himself to the task of putting a hole through the ceiling with furious energy. He didn’t wish to be left behind. His arm aching from his efforts, each attack on the granite ceiling vibrating through his tendons, he chipped away at the ceiling. His efforts were rewarded with a shower of granite. The ceiling was surprisingly fragile, enough to make him worry it would all come crashing down on him.
He wondered how Jack Sheppard had managed it. The sound of chipping granite rang through the prison, sending the zombies into a fervor. How could the guards not have heard what he was up to and come rushing in to stop him? Perhaps they’d been bribed, he thought.
Before long, he was drenched in sweat, his face red and glistening with exertion. He stripped off his waistcoat and flung it on the wooden bench, wiped the sweat from his brow onto his shirt. Exercise was sobering. He no longer felt the delicious energy given to him by the cocaine.
He picked up the iron bar again, was about to renew his efforts, when a sound like distant thunder caught his attention. He set the bar back on the bench and climbed down. Another loud bang followed the first. Gunfire.
He went over to the door. He couldn’t get close enough to look out through the hatch. The zombies still had their fingers thrust through its gaps. He heard more gunshots, dozens of bullets fired one after another. It was difficult to tell, with the way the sound reverberated on the hard walls and bare floor, but it sounded like the gunshots were drawing closer.
Another barrage of gunfire erupted. This time, Roderick was sure it had come from closer. The fingers in the hatch withdrew, and the zombies began to stagger away. He saw one of them fall, a bullet through its skull.
Roderick peered through the hatch. Some of the zombies lay still on the floor. The rest were moving away from the door, all headed in the same direction. It could only mean one thing. Whoever was shooting was close by.
He began banging on the door.
“In here!” he cried, “I’m alive in here!”
Some of the zombies paused at the door and looked in through the hatch to see what all the fuss was about. One by one, their faces dropped away, as a spray of thick, glutinous blood painted the walls and slopped on the floor.
Roderick pressed himself against the door again, and peered through the small square holes into the hallway. The floor was littered with dead bodies. His angle of view was narrow, but he couldn’t see any zombies. He couldn’t see the shooters either.
“In here!” he called again, in case they were still alive. “In here!”
“Did you ‘ear that?” said a voice.
“Hello?” a second voice called loudly.
Roderick practically leapt for joy. They were still alive! Somebody—living people—was still alive.
“In here!” he cried once more. “I’m in this cell.”
He picked up the iron bar from the bench, and used it to bang against the door so they could find him. Finally, a man’s face appeared in front of the hatch. Roderick never thought he’d be so happy just to see a living man’s face, but he felt himself grinning from ear to ear. He felt tears welling up in the corners of his eyes.
“Thank god,” he said, smiling broadly.
He wiped the sweat from his brow with a handkerchief, a bit embarrassed by his appearance. He gathered up his waistcoat and threw it back on hastily, as the man opened the door.
“Kip Lockwood,” said the man, reaching out to shake Roderick’s hand.
Instead, Roderick threw his arms around the man, embracing him firmly. Kip yelped in surprise. Of course, he was even more surprised when Roderick planted a kiss on his cheek.
“Well, uh, Ah’m ’appy to see you, too,” he said, awkwardly.
A short, black-haired girl joined him in the doorway. She had the practical look of a mechanic—worn leather fingerless gloves, fingers stained with oil and grease, and plainly colored clothing. To complete the look, she wore a pair of brass welding goggles on her forehead, and brandished a rusty pipe as her weapon. The pipe was crusted with blood and gore. She was short in stature, but Roderick noticed her broad shoulders and her muscular build. The girl looked like she could pick Roderick up with one hand.
“Kass,” said Kip, “This ’ere’s—actually, didn’t catch your name, sah.”
“Roderick Steen,” Roderick replied, embracing her as if they were old friends.
“Kasumi Hattori,” she replied awkwardly. “People call me Kass.”
“Sorry, I’m just very glad to see people.”
“Yes, well, we didn’t think we’d find anyone in here. At least, nobody who wasn’t—” Kass trailed off.
“A zombie?” Roderick ventured, pointing at the sea of corpses in the hall.
“Is that what you call them?” asked Kass.
Roderick shrugged. “As good a name as any. What are you doing in the prison?”
“Looking for someone,” Kip replied.
“As was I,” said Roderick, “Before I took shelter in here.”
“We shouldn’t linger,” said Kass, heading back into the hallway. She stepped over the corpses carefully. “Might be more of them, and we’re running low on ammunition.”
Roderick followed them into the hall, where they joined the rest of their crew, a dozen or so men who—like Kip—had the look of sailors. Roderick felt a bit out of place in his blood-stained ivory frock coat, blue ascot and kid gloves, but he was just grateful to be among the living again. He followed them, eager to get out of this hell-hole.
“So,” he said, nudging Kip conspiratorially, “Who was it you were looking for?”
“Some bloke called Parson Sinews,” Kip replied. “‘ow ’bout you, sah?”
Roderick raised his eyebrows.
“Small world,” he replied.
True to form, Roderick was quick to assess his new allies, small clues spilling stories, deductions filling in the gaps. Roderick had seen The Penny Dreadful nearby, which meant the men were not sailors; they were the airship’s crew. Clementine Chen was clearly an engineer or a mechanic, while the men were likely crewmen. If they were the Dreadful’s crew, then Jonathan must have sent them. Which meant Jonathan had seen Mr. Sinews’ arrest. It made sense; he would have been at Sinews’ home around the time that Inspector Taggert had sent the police to collect him. So, Jonathan was still investigating The Resurrectionists. This was good news. It meant that his friend was still alive.</Text>

            <Title>Scene Three</Title>
            <Text>“Are you joining us for tea, mother?” Jonathan sneered.
His shock had turned into something else. Barely controlled rage. He knew what Dr. Allen had been about to tell him. He wasn’t an idiot. His mother’s goals aligned with Jack’s, not his father’s. His father, this facility, these were the only things standing in the way.
“What did you do to him?” he demanded, his voice cracking.
“You always were a disobedient brat,” Mrs. Grimmer spat, “Always sticking your nose where it didn’t belong. And do you know what, all this time I’ve only ever tried to protect you.”
“What…” Jonathan snapped. He could feel tears welling up in his eyes. “…did you do to my father?”
The sound of shattering china accentuated the question. Cold tea spilled on the floor, causing Dr. Simms to jump out of his seat.
“Your father lacked vision,” she said coldly. “He was getting in the way of our plans. I told Jack where to find him, and Jack killed him.”
Jonathan felt hot tears welling up in the corner of his eyes, but he blinked them back. He wouldn’t give her that. Wouldn’t let her see how much she’d wounded him. It felt like a knife to the heart.
The door to Dr. Allen’s little underground house swung open again, admitting an entourage of Resurrectionists, each of them clad in the leather crow-like plague masks that Jonathan had already become so familiar with. They halted beside Mrs. Grimmer, awaiting instructions. After a nod from her, Jonathan heard this hiss of air and felt something, a mosquito perhaps, stinging his neck. He felt suddenly very tired.
“Take her to the holding cells for now,” he heard his mother say, as he began to lose consciousness. “Eventually she’ll need to be transported to Chateau d’If, along with the other prisoner, but for now, I believe Dr. Simms will want to study her reaction to Lazarus.”
“Quite right,” he heard a man’s reply.
The words sounded slow and sluggish to his ears, and his vision was becoming hazy. He could see Miss Monday, her one eye looking straight at him without focus. There was something sticking out of her neck. A dart, it looked like.
“As for Jonathan…” he heard.
Then, nothing.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Roderick, Taggert, and Hargrave head to Newgate Prison, but the place is overrun by zombies.</Synopsis>
            <Text>A murder of crows wheeled overhead, a hundred raucous voices cawing noisily. Roderick had never seen so many crows in one place. They circled gracefully, black shadows against a grey backdrop, and perched on trees and archways. One of them swooped down and tried to land on one of the zombies, whose clumsy fists caused the bird to retreat to the prison roof.
The prison stood at the corner of Newgate and Old Bailey. It originally served as a gate in the Roman wall, but had served as a prison now for centuries. It had been expanded and rebuilt over the years. Now, it was built around a central courtyard, an awful building of heavy bricks and few windows. Its walls were reinforced with iron. Blatant symbols of imprisonment were carved into the bricks around each door and window: chains, shackles, the scales of justice. A crow perched on the ledge above one of the windows. The towers of St. Paul’s loomed in the distance.
Roderick sized it up, and shared a look with Detective Inspector Taggert and Mr. Hargrave. There was no time to hesitate. They had encountered hundreds of zombies on their way here. They were out of breath. There were zombies trailing behind them. Ahead, there were even more. They had nowhere to go but the prison.
Only a few zombies stood by the door to the prison. Roderick raised his letter opener, but Taggert stopped him with a hand on his shoulder.
“I’ll do it,” he said, and headed over to clear the path to the front door.
A few quick blows to their skulls, and the zombies hit the ground and lay motionless. There was a flurry of wings as crows took flight and circled over the corpses.
“You’re becoming quite efficient, Detective Inspector,” said Roderick, heading after him.
Taggert snorted. “If I didn’t know better, Mr. Steen, I’d say that sounded a bit like praise.”
“Don’t read into it,” Roderick said, giving him a wink.
Hargrave taking up the rear, they headed into the infamous prison, a few zombies trailing distantly behind them. Hargrave shut the door.
The prison was lit by gas. Its stark walls of brick seemed to swallow up the light, so the halls were dark and bare. Roderick had half expected to be greeted by a guard upon entering the prison, somehow feeling that the great brick building was impenetrable and unsusceptible to the zombie plague. That feeling was gone now.
They found what was left of the guard within moments. Gore and blood stained the walls behind him. His organs spilled out of his body and onto the floor. Somehow he had been decapitated. There were rough bite marks along his neck. Inspector Taggert appeared to be having trouble keeping his lunch down.
Roderick shrugged. He was getting over his squeamishness rather quickly. He felt, rather pragmatically, that he had seen much worse on the way here. Roderick could be hysterical when there was just cause, and a decapitated prison guard certainly qualified, but someone needed to keep it together.
Other than the remains of a single guard, the hallways was deserted. He motioned for the officers to follow him, offering a handkerchief to Taggert, who used it to wipe the bile from his chin.
“It should be easy to find Mr. Sinews,” he whispered. “I understand the prison is divided into common and state sections?”
“That’s right,” Taggert confirmed.
“Then we’ll find him in the state section.”
“Why are we whispering?” Taggert whispered back.
“Because I don’t want the dead to hear me,” Roderick replied.
“Do you think there are more of them in here?” Hargrave asked.
Roderick paused a moment to look back at the ravaged prison guard, and gave a meaningful nod to Hargrave and Taggert.
“I don’t think he chewed his own head off,” Roderick answered. “Do you?”</Text>

            <Text>To some, a pleasing manner comes very naturally. If born to the possession of an easy flow of language, agreeableness of address, poetical and imaginative power, and large knowledge of human nature, the whole accompanied by judicious training, good education and wide opportunities, such persons will most surely, without studied effort, be self-possessed and at ease in any company, upon any occasion.
On the contrary, if the natural advantages have been few, and the opportunities for acquiring polished deportment limited, then we may very appropriately make a study of the subject of how to please.
Hence we have the necessity for special instruction on the Subject of Etiquette.</Text>

            <Title>Scene 34</Title>
            <Synopsis>Jonathan arrives at the Grimmer Company, and learns that Miss Monday was looking for him.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Jonathan made his way up the driveway to the entrance of the building, as the Penny Dreadful rose into the air again after expelling some of the water from its ballasts.
He climbed the small flight of stairs and headed inside.
The almost-musical clang of the printing press resonated down the hall, signaling that the day’s operations had already begun. There was a hum of activity, which shouldn’t have surprised Jonathan. He swept through the lobby, giving a brusque nod to the receptionist as he headed toward the door.
“Mr. Grimmer,” the receptionist called.
He paused at the door and turned around.
“Mrs. Thompson?”
“It’s good you’re here,” she said. “We worried you had run into a bit of trouble.”
Jonathan smiled. “I was aboard the Dreadful,” he said.
“I trust you heard about the…well, the random acts of violence?”
Jonathan nodded.
“Yes,” he told her. “I saw one of them, actually. A man tried to kill me.”
He was thinking of the zombie he and Henry Charles Ocelot had encountered outside Mr. Sinews’ house. The man had tried to kill Jonathan. Were these acts of random acts of violence connected to the Lazarus Virus?
Mrs. Thompson visibly paled. “Good god!” she cried, “And you’re alright?”
“I’m fine,” he said. To his surprise, he meant it. “How many of these random acts of violence have been reported?”
“Countless. Too many to report. Thousands, at least. Astounding acts of violence,” she said, shuddering, “A father came home from an ordinary day at work. According to the maid, who hid herself in the scullery and witnessed the entire incident, said the man collapsed in a fit of coughing. When he recovered, he tore out his wife’s throat with his teeth. He ate her liver. Then he killed both his sons and his newborn daughter.”
Jonathan paled. Again, he wondered if this could be the work of the Lazarus Virus. Could this act of violence have been committed by one of the Resurrectionist’s zombies? Was this their vision of a Dead London?
“God,” he said, unable to find more words.
“That’s just one incident of many,” said Mrs. Thompson. “Just one.”
“I need to speak with Palmer,” he said.
As important was it was to keep the citizens of London informed by printing what they could, Jonathan’s priority was still finding the Resurrectionists. He didn’t know if they would have a cure for the disease they’d unleashed. He didn’t know if it was already too late to save the city. But he knew he had to try. Palmer had worked closely with Jonathan’s father. He might know something about the Resurrectionists.
Again, Mrs. Thompson stopped him in his tracks.
“There’s one more thing,” she said.
Jonathan turned around and inclined his head toward her. “Yes?”
“There was someone here looking for you,” she said.
Jonathan felt a chill creep over his flesh. Had the Resurrectionists found him already? Were they still after him? He’d felt that since they had already begun their Dead London Project, they wouldn’t bother looking for him. He suddenly realized he’d been wrong. After all, even with Dead London underway, they’d still felt it necessary to deal with Parson Sinews and Lord Connor. He felt foolish for coming here. Of course they would look for him here.
“Who was it? What did they want?”
“A lady,” said Mrs. Thompson, and Jonathan felt a momentary relief. Then he realized that there might just as well be women among the Resurrectionists. “She didn’t say what she wanted, only that she was looking for you. When I went to check your office, she left.”
Jonathan nodded. It certainly sounded like suspicious behavior. He felt even more certain that this mystery woman was a Resurrectionist.
“I don’t suppose you got a name?” he asked.
Mrs. Thompson nodded happily.
“Miss Monday.”</Text>
            <Notes>"I got an aerial view of the aftermath of the violence," Jonathan told her. "It seems concentrated in specific parts of the city."
Mrs. Thomspon nodded. "That would be consistent with out reports. We have a number of journalists in the field. We're beginning to form a pretty clear picture of the situation."
She grabbed a map off her desk and showed it to Jonathan. A few green blots on the paper showed the locations of each of the reporters. The areas affected by the sudden outbursts of violence were coloured red. It was much like the picture Jonathan had gotten from above. He looked to Lincoln's Inn Fields, where Connor's ball had taken place, and saw that it was filled in with red.
"Lord Connor's?" he asked.
Mrs. Thompson nodded.
"Our earliest reports came from that area," she said, pointing to the spot on the map. "Our journalists couldn't get in close enough to get a clear report, without putting their own lives at risk. As far as we know, the police visited the Connor residence. The house was filled with dead bodies, many of them bludgeoned to death by the police themselves."
Jonathan blinked at her in surprise.
“I was at Connor's ball last night,” he told her. “This must have happened after I left,” he said, scarcely able to believe what he was hearing.
He thought of Roderick, who had gone to Connor’s to investigate Connor’s death. Instead, he would find a house filled with corpses. He shuddered, and thought of Mr. Monday, the thief he’d met in Connor’s study. He wondered if Monday had gotten out alive.</Notes>

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>It was the death of a single patient that had caused Jack to shut down his medical practice. The countless lives he saved over the years meant nothing to him, not when weighed against that one death. He’d packed up his things, returned to London, and absorbed himself in a new pursuit with the same excess with which he’d studied medicine. Mechanical Engineering. He’d proved equally adept at that trade, and it was still his profession when Annabel first met him. A tinkerer and inventor, he used to build the most unimaginable devices, life-altering mechanical machines. Like Annabel’s clockwork eye.
His eyes widened as Annabel raised the pistol, and without another word, without another thought, she put a bullet in his skull.
She gasped with relief and regret and anguish as his blood spattered across her cheek, hot and wet. It seemed to sting as it struck her skin.
Abraham gasped in surprise, but Annabel’s attention was focused on Jack’s body. His eyes and mouth wide with surprise, a gaping hole through his left cheek, his body lay still on the floor.
Annabel’s knees threatened to buckle, and tears formed in her eye, but she kept herself upright. Finally, she returned her attention to Mr. Palmer.
“Let me up,” he was saying, as Annabel recovered her nerves and steadied herself. “You’ve got to let me up.”
He was gesturing towards something off in the distance. She blinked the tears from her eyes and looked. The zombies were staggering down the hall towards them.
She cursed. Wiping the blood from her face, she let Abraham up.
“If it comes down to it, I won’t hesitate to shoot you,” she warned him.
He got to his feet, a little worse for wear. He rubbed his injured jaw.
Meanwhile, Annabel stooped over, pulled the collar of Jack’s shirt aside. She pulled his cravat out of the way and examined his skin. The red pock-marks that Abraham had pointed out on Dr. Simms were not present on Jack’s pale skin. Of course not. He’d designed the serum himself. Why would he be dosed? Yet there was still some part of her that had believed he wasn’t capable of such an act of evil. Wasn’t it possible that Dr. Allen had been the mastermind behind Dead London, and that he’d brainwashed Jack?
But no, here was proof that everything Jack had done, he’d done of his own free will. Jack was responsible for London’s fate.
She tore herself away from the body on the ground. There was no time to mourn or to think about what she had done. The zombies were coming, and they were surprisingly fast for walking corpses, converging upon them from both directions. There was not nearly enough ammunition to deal with all of them.
“Where did they come from?” she exclaimed.
She tried the door to the Beta Laboratory, but it had been locked behind them. She banged on the door. She cursed as she scanned the hallway for another door. There wasn’t one, at least not between them and the zombies, and it would take too long to pick the lock.
“We’ll have to make a stand,” Abraham told her.
“I don’t like our odds,” she said, banging on the door again.
When no one answered it, she raised the pistol. There was nothing else for it but to put as many bullets in their skulls as they could, and then fight their way out with their bare hands.
Annabel closed her eye, relying on the prosthesis for her vision, squeezed the trigger, and one of them fell to the floor. He disappeared under the sea of zombies who climbed over him without seeming to slow.
She aimed and fired again with deadly accuracy, moved the revolver half an inch to the left, pulled the trigger again. Without pause, she fired into their midst, one bullet at a time. Each bullet hit its mark, but it was not enough. They continued to advance, their numbers practically unaffected by the onslaught of bullets.
“There’s too many of them,” she told Abraham.
“Just keep shooting,” he shouted back. They were inches away from each other, but the sounds of gunfire ricocheting down the hallway and the carnivorous moans of the zombies were deafening.
Abraham grunted, kicking at the doorknob to the laboratory with all his might. If they couldn’t pick the lock, maybe he could break it down. It was up to Annabel to buy him enough time.
She aimed again, pulled the trigger, and fired her last bullet. She hadn’t been counting, and only realised she was out when she fired again and heard the hollow click of an empty chamber.
She stuffed the gun back into her holster, and looked to Abraham. The latch still hadn’t broken. The zombies were almost upon them. Annabel marched forward, towards the creatures.
“What are you doing?” Abraham grunted.
“Just get that damned door open,” she shouted back.
She grabbed the first of them by the face, careful not to let his jaws seize upon her hands, and slammed his face into the wall. His skull cracked, and he fell to the floor. She stomped on his head for good measure, and caved in the next man’s face with a wicked right hook, all in one swift motion.
Already, another creature was grabbing at her, this time from behind. She grabbed his arms as if to fling him over her back, using his momentum against him, but his body was rotten, and his arms popped out of their sockets with a nasty plop, the skin and meat ripping from his rotting limbs like a snake sloughing off its skin. Annabel dropped one of the arms, but held onto the other.
She whirled around to face him, and recognised him. This was the creature from the tank. He was not merely rotten, but wet, soggy even. No wonder his arms had ripped out so easily. She raised his limb and swung it at his skull, using it to bludgeon him to death.
Even as she continued to fight, heart pounding as she kicked at the nearest walking cadaver, she registered a thought. Someone must have let these creatures out, deliberately.
At last, she heard Abraham’s voice, rising above the din.
“It’s open!”
She hurried to the door, ripping out the trachea of the nearest zombie fiend that assailed her in order to disengage from the fight. She landed a devastating blow with her right hand that knocked his head clean off. Still, she fought her way through the crowd, as they moved clumsily to sink their teeth into her flesh, until she found the open doorway and practically fell through it.
Remarkably, she was unscathed. She heaved, struggling against her corset for breath, as Abraham launched himself bodily at the door. It slammed, not quite shut, for several cadaverous limbs were caught in the door, their fingers still grasping for living flesh. Abraham strained against it, and it thudded inward, threatening to cave beneath the combined weight of the zombies on the other side.
The scientists looked alarmed, but did not intervene as Annabel hurried to help. She set herself against the door, but even the two of them could not hold it closed for long.
“A knife!” Annabel shouted at the alarmed boffins. “Or something sharp. Do you have one?”
Stunned into inaction, they simply stared at her in silence.
“Now!” she bellowed.
At last, Dr. Simms seemed to grasp, if not the situation, then at least that they were in danger. He hurried to find a tool from off the shelf, something sharp. Finally, he presented her with a long, jagged knife of surgical steel.
“Will this do, Doctor?” he asked.
She grabbed the knife, and whistled appreciatively. Who cared if he thought she was a doctor, so long as he kept the weapons coming.
She hesitated, looking at Abraham as she assessed the situation.
“Another one, for Mr. Palmer, if you have one?” she said finally.
Then, leaving Mr. Palmer to keep the door shut, she positioned herself with knife raised, at the edge of the door. He would have to make due with a scalpel, as that was what the addled-minded doctor had given him, but he gave Annabel a nod. When she returned the gesture, he stepped back from the doorway, and readied his scalpel.</Text>

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>It was as if the unliving sensed their fallen brethren and had flocked to the scene intent on vengeance. Or perhaps Mr. O was right; perhaps someone was making these creatures. Seemingly out of nowhere, the dead came shambling out of the fog that so often clung to the ground along the banks of the Thames.
“God save me,” Miss Monday exclaimed, drawing both pistols from her belt at once.
As they approached, she tried to focus on each one of them individually, and not be overwhelmed by their numbers. Her hands began to sweat. Her pulse quickened. But she held her hands steady, and began to fire with her usual near-perfect aim. The dead dropped like flies.
Dressed in petticoats and corsets, waistcoats and top hats, spats and vests, they shambled en masse, sporting pocket watches, gloves, and handkerchiefs. Their clothes were ripped and bloodied. Their eyes were white and red and lifeless, their skin discoloured by rot. The disease did not spare the wealthy or the working class. All were susceptible to its horrors.
Their flesh was diseased with the plague of the unliving. Some of them had sloughed off limbs the way a snake sheds its skin. Here, a man with no left foot. There, a woman missing all of her fingers on one hand. A child, with no lips and no nose. No skin on its face at all. Just bone and blood and dead eyes. The terrible stench of decay wafted in from the fog, overtaking the sour odour of the river.
The child led the pack, outpacing the rest as it shuffled its way along the riverbank. Miss Monday raised her gun, aimed it at the child’s face, and pulled the trigger. Her breath caught in her throat as she saw a cloud of dry and powdery blood fill the air. The boy fell into the mud.
She felt a brief pang of guilt; she’d just killed a child, for god’s sake. But no. She had to remind herself, no, the child had been long dead. And there was no time to feel guilty.
They were not human. They were hungry, dead-eyed monsters, and they were steadily drawing closer. Miss Monday squeezed the trigger again, and the limping man with one foot fell to the ground and stopped moving. The dead pressed on, climbing over the corpses of the fallen.
She backed up, but she was trapped between the army of the dead on one side and the River on the other. Even if she could escape into the river, she couldn’t do so without abandoning Mr. O.
She fired another round, and a woman with a bonnet collapsed on the muddy ground.
Still they kept moving forward, as quickly as Miss Monday could kill them.
She had to stop to quickly reload her pistols. Then, standing guard over Mr. O’s unconscious body, she aimed and fired. Another body fell into the pile.
She heard a sound behind her. She spun around, and found herself staring into the pale red eyes of walking death. She swung her pistol, struck its head as hard as he could. It fell to the ground.
But it was still moving. It reached out with limbs that were stiff with decay and with yellow fingernails grasped Mr. O’s legs.
She kicked the creature hard, and it fell over backward, but it grasped her leg, and dragged Miss Monday down with it. Down, into the worm-infested banks of the river.
It grasped at her hair, grabbed at her with clumsy hands, and snarled. She tried to raise her pistol, but the creature had seized her by the arm. Its jaws descended upon her right arm. She struggled to pull away from its tight grasp, but the creature had her pinned down.
It opened its jaws and sunk its teeth into her arm.
A shower of blood and brains exploded, splattering upon Miss Monday’s already muddy clothes.
She looked back and saw Mr. O, still lying on the ground, one eye open, the other squinting. His gun was still smoking.
“Oh, good, you’re awake,” she said crossly.
“Thank you, Mr. O, you’ve saved my life,” he said in falsetto. His voice dropped an octave. “Oh, don’t mention it. Least I could do.”
“Do shut up,” she replied. “In case you haven’t noticed…”
She gestured broadly at the shambling masses of the dead. Still, they continued to converge upon the Thames, staggering toward them in impressive numbers.
“We’ve got to get out of here,” said Mr. O, suddenly serious.
Even if these had been the average run-of-the mill walking corpses—if walking corpses could ever be considered run-of-the-mill—the duo would have had a hard time of it. As it was, many of these corpses had been somehow altered. Tampered with, by someone who wanted to kill her. As they drew nearer, they saw that some of them had weapons attached to them, drilled through their bodies like the clockwork device affixed to the girl.
“We’ve got to get out of here now,” said Mr. O, his voice still shaky but assertive.
But there was nowhere to go.
Instead, Miss Monday pulled a grenade from her pouch, lit the fuse with a match, and promptly tossed it away. The device exploded, a dozen of the armed corpses with it.
“Well,” she said, “I should have done that sooner.”
“I hadn’t realised you’d brought those,” said Mr. O, looking at her in surprise and amazement. He climbed to his feet, rubbing his head painfully.
“I told you I never go anywhere unprepared.”
“How many of those have you got?” Mr. O asked. He wanted to ask where she’d got them, but he left it at that.
“Not enough,” she said, “Let’s go.”</Text>

            <Title>The Etiquette of Introductions</Title>
            <Text>Always apply the titles when making introductions where the persons are entitled to the same, such as Honorable, Reverend, Professor, etc. Thus, in introducing a clergyman to a member of the legislature, it is etiquette to say: “Mr. Sheldon, permit me to present to you the Reverend Mr. Wing.”
Addressing Mr. Shelden, he says: “Mr. Wing is the pastor of the First Presbyterian Church at Troy, New York.”
Addressing Mr. Wing, he continues: “Mr. Shelden is at present our representative in the State Legislature, and author of The Shelden Letters which you have so admired.”
To approach another in a boisterous manner, saying, “Hello, Old Fellow!,” “Hello, Bob,” or using kindred expressions, indicates ill-breeding. If approached, however, in this vulgar manner, it is better to give a civil reply, and address the person respectfully, in which case he is quite likely to be ashamed of his own conduct.
Husbands and wives indicate pleasant conjugal relation existing when they address each other in the family circle by their Christian names, though the terms of respect, “Mr.” And “Mrs.,” may be applied to each other among strangers.

General Rules of Etiquette

	•	Never point at another person
	•	Never wantonly frighten others
	•	Never make yourself the hero of your own story
	•	Never pick your teeth or clean your nails in company
	•	Never question a servant or a child about family matters
	•	Never read letters which you may find addressed to others
	•	Never call attention to the features or form of anyone present
	•	Never seem to notice a scar, deformity, or defect of anyone present

When speaking to a boy under fifteen years of age, outside of the circle of relatives, among comparative strangers, call him by his Christian name, such as “Charles,” “William,” etc.
Above that age, if the boy has attained good physical and intellectual development, apply the “Mr.” As in “Mr. Brown,” “Mr. King,” etc. To do so will please him, will raise his self-respect, and will be tendering a courtesy which you highly valued when you were of the same age.
It is an insult to address a boy or girl who is a stranger to you as “Bub” or “Sis.” Children are sometimes very sensitive on these points, resenting such method of being addressed, while they very highly appreciate being spoken to respectfully. Thus, if the child’s name is unknown, to say “My Boy,” or “My Little Lad,” “My Girl,” or “My Little Lady,” will be to gain favor and set the child a good example in politeness. Children forever gratefully remember those who treat them respectfully.
The inferior is to be introduced to the superior; the younger to the older; the gentleman to the lady.
To shake hands when introduced is optional; between gentlemen it is common, and oftentimes between an elderly and a young person. It is not common between an unmarried lady and a gentleman, a slight bow between them when introduced being all that etiquette requires. The married lady will use her discretion when introduced to gentlemen.
Ladies being introduced should never bow hastily, but with slow and measured dignity.
If you are a gentleman, do not let the lack of an introduction prevent you from rendering services to any unattended lady who may need them.
To completely ignore another to whom you have been rightly introduced, by meeting the person with a vacant stare, is a mark of ill-breeding.</Text>

“Then these agonies began swiftly to subside, and I came to myself as if out of a great sickness. There was something strange in my sensations, something indescribably sweet. I felt younger, lighter, happier in body; within I was conscious of a heady recklessness, a current of disordered sensual images running like a millrace in my fancy, a solution of the bonds of obligation, an unknown but innocent freedom of the soul. I knew myself, at the first breath of this new life, to be more wicked, tenfold more wicked, sold a slave to my original evil and the thought, in that moment, braced and delighted me like wine.”
- Robert Louis Stevenson, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

“This was the shocking thing; that the slime of the pit seemed to utter cries and voices; that the amorphous dust gesticulated and sinned; that what was dead, and had no shape, should usurp the offices of life. And this again, that that insurgent horror was knit to him closer than a wife, closer than an eye; lay caged in his flesh, where he heard it mutter and felt it struggle to be born; and at every hour of weakness, and in the confidence of slumber, prevailed against him, and deposed him out of life.”

            <Title>The Etiquette of Shaking Hands</Title>
            <Text>Offer the whole hand. It is an insult, and indicates snobbery, to present two fingers when shaking hands. It is also insulting to return a warm, cordial greeting with a lifeless hand, an evident indifference of manner, when hand-shaking.
Present a cordial grasp and clasp the hand firmly, shaking it warmly for a period of two or three seconds, and then relinquishing the grasp entirely. It is rude to grasp the hand very tightly or to shake it over-vigorously. To hold it a very long time is often very embarrassing, and is a breach of etiquette.
In shaking hands, as an evidence of cordiality, regard, and respect, offer the right hand, unless the same be engaged, in which case, apologize, by saying “Excuse my left hand.” It is the right hand that carries the sword in time of war, and its extension is emblematic of friendliness in time of peace.</Text>

            <Title>The Etiquette of Conversation</Title>
            <Text>To acquire the art of conversation in a superior degree, there must be intimacy with those who possess refinements and general information. There must also be observed certain general rules in order to accomplish the best results, prominent among which are the following:
	•	Be cool, collected, and self-possessed, using respectful, chaste, and appropriate language
	•	Recollect that the object of conversation is to entertain and amuse
	•	Be patient. The foreigner cannot, perhaps, recall the word he desires; the speaker may be slow of speech; you may have heard the story a dozen times; but even then you must evince interest and listen patiently through
	•	Do not always commence a conversation by an allusion to the weather.
	•	Do not, when narrating an incident, continually say “you see,” “you know,” etc.
	•	Do not use profanity, vulgar terms, slang, phrases, words of double meaning, or language that will bring the blush to any person
	•	Do not intersperse your language with foreign words and high-sounding terms. It shows affectation, and will draw ridicule upon you.
	•	Do not make a pretense of gentility, nor parade the fact that you are a descendant of any notable family. You must pass for just what you are, and must stand on your own merit.
	•	Do not make a parade of being acquainted with distinguished or wealthy people, or having been to college, or of having visited foreign lands. All this is no evidence of any real genuine worth on your part.
	•	Do not use the surname alone when speaking of your husband or wife to others. To say to another, that “I told Jones,” referring to your husband, sounds badly, whereas, to say, “I told Mr. Jones,” shows respect and good breeding.
	•	Do not attempt to pry into the private affairs of others by asking what their profits are, what things cost, whether Melissa ever “had a beau,” and why Amarette never got married.
	•	Do not aspire to be a great storyteller. An inveterate teller of long stories becomes very tiresome. To tell one or two witty, short, new stories, appropriate to the occasion, is about all that one person should inflict on the company.
	•	Do not indulge in satire; no doubt you are witty, and you could say a most cutting thing that would bring the laugh of the company upon your opponent, but you must not allow it, unless to rebuke an impertinent fellow who can be suppressed in no other way.

General Rules of Etiquette

	•	Never punish your child for a fault to which you are addicted yourself.
	•	Never, when traveling abroad, be over-boastful in praise of your own country.
	•	Never lend an article you have borrowed unless you have permission to do so
	•	Never exhibit anger, impatience, or excitement when an accident happens.
	•	Never will a gentleman allude to conquest which he may have made with ladies.
	•	Never fail to offer the easiest and best seat in the room to an invalid, an elderly person, or a lady.</Text>

            <Title>Scene Four</Title>
            <Text>Roderick and Bailey had been up late, playing chess. The dog had won, but Roderick did not let that bother him. His mind hadn’t really been in it, and in his defense he’d been making Bailey’s moves for him. The game was mostly meant as a way to clear his head.
The truth was that although he’d put on an impressive display at Lord Connor’s manor, he had hardly any better idea of what was going on than did Scotland Yard.
He’d told Inspector Taggert his theory. Then he’d hailed a hansom cab to take him home for some much needed rest. But sleep hadn’t come. He was somewhat of a night owl anyway, and would often stay up well into the morning hours when working a case. He kept running over the events in his head. What if he’d done something different, figured it out more quickly? Could he have saved the policemen who’d been slain by the risen dead?
“The first of the two men who visited Lord Connor’s study was a thief. He entered Connor’s study with the intention of robbing the man’s safe. However, Connor was infected with that same strange affliction that caused his guests to rise from the dead, and attacked the would-be-thief.”
“A struggle took place, but the thief emerged victorious and followed through with his initial plan, breaking into the safe. He left the way he came, making a bit of a scene on his way out. The affliction began to spread. At some point during or shortly after all this, the second man entered Connor’s study; his intentions are unclear. Finding Connor already dead, he must have come to the conclusion that to be seen leaving Connor’s study would implicate him in the crime. He barred the door and made to flee via the window; his airship was parked outside. The door was broken down, but he had already escaped.”
“The affliction, by this point, was already spreading. This seems to have done an effective job of covering the tracks of both of the men involved. Only the one witness, Miss Karnstein, seems to have any information that may be of any use. Furthermore, someone returned after Connor’s guests were infected, in order to stage the scene, making it appear to be the work of Dr. Allen.”
“But why?” Taggert had wanted to know. “Why the coverup?”
“I’m not sure,” Roderick had admitted. “The evidence, that Mr. Sinews was involved in this crime, is circumstantial at best, which suggests that somebody wished to frame him. In other words, staging the scene may have more to do with framing Mr. Sinews than it does with covering up Lord Connor’s murder. I’ll want to interview Miss Karnstein. I’ll also need a list of all the guests who attended Connor’s ball.”
The detective had nodded, but Roderick was confident that the man’s tiny little brain was still slogging its way through the notion of dead men walking, and even Roderick was struggling to piece this mystery together. There were too many variables, too many unknowns. Most of what he’d pieced together so far was guesswork.
“I’ll also want to speak with Mr. Sinews,” he’d told the inspector. “I’m not remotely convinced of his guilt, but it may be that he has some information on the real culprits. In fact, it seems likely that he would. It would explain why they’ve attempted to silence him.”
“They?”
“It seems likely, doesn’t it, Inspector, that this was not the work of one man acting alone? Good evening Taggert. It’s been a long day. I trust you’ll send Scotland Yard’s best to tend to the remaining sick. And by tend to them, I do mean shoot them in the head. Seriously, Inspector, I would not take any chances.”
At home, Roderick ran his toes through the carpet, swallowed a morsel of hard toffee, and washed it down with a glass of milk. He wiped his mouth and looked down at Bailey, who was looking up at him expectantly.
“Very well, Bailey,” he said. “A stroll is likely just what I need to clear my head.”
Bailey wagged his tail enthusiastically, and Roderick patted his head affectionately. He pulled on a pair of socks and stuffed his feet into a pair of boots. Then he was out the door, letting his dog lead the way.
While he walked, his mind was at work. Bailey wandered the sidewalk, sniffing for squirrels and birds, and occasionally stopping to mark his territory, but Roderick paid him no mind.
He was mentally meandering through Lord Connor’s office, taking in the specks of blood on the door, rifling through the sheets of paper on his desk again. There was one page. One page that stood out, different from all the others. He’d flipped through the pages too quickly, and had missed it then. How that page had failed to stand out before, he couldn’t say; perhaps he’d been distracted. Perhaps he was just slipping. Either way, it had entered his subconscious mind, and the page stood out now.
One single sheet of paper, blank except for a sketch. No, not a sketch. A logo. Quickly flipping through the pages, vainly aiming to make an impression on the handsomely moustachioed policeman and not attentive to the details, he’d scarcely glanced at the sketch. For a man who prided himself on his keen intellect, he could be awfully dense at times. But now the image flashed back in his mind. A crow’s head.
“The symbol of the Resurrectionists,” he said aloud. “Quoth the raven,” he muttered. “Nevermore.”
How had he missed such an obvious clue? He’d been quick to dismiss the connection to the Resurrectionists; it was obvious that the garish Connor tableau was not the work of Dr. Allen. But that shouldn’t mean that the Resurrectionists were entirely uninvolved.
What did it mean, that Connor had one of their letters on his desk? A blank page with the Resurrectionists’s emblem. Could it mean…
Was Lord Connor a Resurrectionist? This certainly changed the focus of Roderick’s investigation. Whatever might have been in Connor’s safe was likely of importance to the Resurrectionists. Which meant that the thief was most likely a fellow member of that secret club.
He had to return to the Connor mansion. He needed to see it again. Perhaps with this newfound knowledge he would see something else that he had missed before.
“Bailey,” he called, rounding the corner to change directions. “This way.”
Silence greeted him in return. No jangling collar. No scampering feet. No hyperactively sniffing snout. Just the unnerving silence of a London that had gone to sleep. He whirled around, his eyes seeking out any sign of his furry friend. A single flickering gas lamp cast long shadows onto the square brick buildings that lined the road. It was nearly dawn, but the street was still dark.
“Bailey,” he called again.
A layer of fog drifted along the cobblestones. He heard a sound that might have been Bailey’s collar and spun in the direction of the sound. He saw only a chain attached to a locked gate, rattling in the wind.
“Bailey, where have you gone, boy?” he called out into the dark.
He stood, helpless, on the side of the street, his arms wide, imploring, calling Bailey to him.
Finally, a sound broke through the unnerving silence. The movement of feet. He followed the sound, despite the danger of wandering an alleyway alone, this late at night, in this city. Desperately.
Throwing caution to the wind, he stepped into the alley, following the footsteps into the darkness. His eyes still adjusting to the gloom, he made his way through the alley almost entirely by sound alone. The footsteps had stopped, but he followed them, until he nearly walked straight into their source.
A man stood there, still mostly indistinguishable in the darkness. His back was to Roderick, and in this dim light, he was more shadow than man. But perhaps he’d seen his dog. Perhaps Bailey had followed his scent in search of a new playmate.
Speaking of scent, even Roderick could have followed this man’s scent. He must have been living in this alleyway; even in the stench of London, the man’s smell was potent. He smelled sickly. Like walking death.
Roderick felt a knot beginning to form in the pit of his stomach. An unsettling chill that came not from the night’s cold breeze, but from a creeping suspicion.
“Sir,” he said, desperation overcoming his fear. “My dog,” he pleaded. “Have you seen my dog? He must have come this way.”
The man didn’t turn. Not right away. Just kept on chewing. Yes, he was eating something. Chewing noisily. The scent of fresh meat penetrated even the homeless man’s own sour stench of sweat and rot.
“Please,” said Roderick. “My dog…”
Finally, the man turned.
Roderick recoiled. His face. It was covered in blood and meat. He could see that, even in the darkness. Blood and meat. His teeth, glistening, red, chunks of meat between his teeth. Chewing noisily upon gristle and flesh. In his hands, a ravaged handful of meat and wet fur.</Text>
            <Comments>too silly?
Reading ahead, this line no longer makes sense.  Roderick does have an idea.  I would change this sentence to saying that he didn’t know for sure what happened, but could only go by what the evidence in the room gave him.
delete this? begin at the next paragraph?
revise
I would end the quote here and then include some action.  Like Roderick making the motions to leave, either by standing up or holding out his hand to shake the inspectors.  Then continue with him giving his goodbyes.  Some separation between the question and the farewell.
This sounds as though he is just getting home, and not picking up from before the explanation of his theory was given.  I suggest that you get rid of the first paragraph about him playing chess with the dog.
Is it the next day?
Before the dog was sniffing at birds and squirrels, I don’t personally recall seeing too many squirrels out at night.  Just noting that the time of day is unclear based on the bits of information.
oh no!  Poor Bailey.</Comments>

            <Text>He began his speech with a shrug of his shoulders. “Lord Connor was a good man. Well liked, well respected, a gentleman and a philanthropist. A writer. A scientist. And as I said, he was also a monster hunter. But why do you suppose your clients wanted him dead?” He said ‘clients’ in such a way as to emphasize the fact that it was her term, not his. “I knew Lord Connor, while he was alive. I knew him well. And even I don’t know what was in his safe. So I have to wonder, if your clients knew what was in the safe, did they know Connor better than I do? And if so, can they have been ignorant about the monsters Connor was hunting? I think not.”
Miss Monday was quick to follow Mr. O’s logic. “You believe they wanted to stop Connor from killing these monsters?”
She took a sip of tea, which she found had gone cold already.
Mr. O shook his head. “I don’t know. But it seems pretty obvious that killing him had something to do with Connor’s interest in the monstrous dead. Whoever hired you knew all about the unliving. And whoever turned Connor knew it too. Which makes me think…”
Again, Miss Monday was right on the same page. “My clients are the ones who turned him. They sent me after him, knowing full well he was already dead. Well, so to speak. But why?”
She set her teacup down on the bench. It was empty. She thought about refilling it from the canteen, but she decided that one cup was plenty.
“I believe they were killing anyone with knowledge of the unliving,” said Mr. O. She began to object, but he cut her off. “I believe you know more about the monstrous dead than you’re letting on.”
She bit her lip, and her hand moved to her right eye. She hid the gesture by brushing her hand through her hair, but Mr. O was astute. He must have noticed it. She remained silent.
“In short, I believe that your clients have knowledge of the secret I have sworn to keep. And I believe they are doing their utmost to kill anyone else who knows it. Which means that my life and yours are in very grave danger.”
“Who are they?” she asked, wishing for the first time that she’d taken more time to investigate her clients, anonymity be damned.
“Before I answer that, there’s something else you should know. I believe Lord Connor may have been one of them.”
“One of them? You’re speaking in riddles, Mr. O. Who is them?”
“The Society of Immortals,” he said.
She raised an eyebrow. She’d heard the name before. Everyone had. A group of likeminded men of science whose controversial theories on the nature of mortality had forced them to pursue their research in relative secrecy. Relative, because while the real names of the society’s members and the exact nature of the collective’s research were unknown, they’d made headlines in the past with a series of murders, some of which had previously been attributed to Jack The Ripper. Until the Society of Immortals had stepped up to take ownership of the crimes. They planned to bring their victims back to life, that they might live forever, or so they claimed. While one of their members had been arrested and promptly executed, the rest remained at large.
“Seriously?” she said.
When she thought about the society and the possible connection to Lord Connor, it was impossible not to make the connection between the society’s plans to resurrect its victims and Lord Connor’s own resurrection. When they spoke of resurrection, were they speaking about the unliving, she wondered. She put the question to Mr. O.
“I believe so, yes” said Mr. O. “The name Francis Langtry lends itself to that theory. The names of the Society’s members follow a formula. Their given names are taken from penny dreadful characters, their surnames from the names of famous actresses.
“You said that Connor was a good man,” she said.
Mr. O sighed. “Sometimes good men take wrong turns,” he said after a while. “Not all of the Society’s ideas are bad. The notion of finding a cure for death itself. Who wouldn’t want that? I imagine that’s what drew Connor in. But it’s their methods that are unsettling. Perhaps that’s why they killed him. Perhaps he tried to leave the Society.”
She forced herself not to laugh. He spoke with a calm nonchalance, yet his words always seemed to carry a flair for the melodramatic. Everything was a grand conspiracy with him.
“So, you believe the Society hired me to kill Connor, who until recently was working with them. When he tried to leave their ranks, they deliberately infected him, turned him into a monster, and tried to use him to kill me, believing my assassination attempt would fail?” Sarcasm oozed from the very pores of her skin. “It all sounds rather convoluted, don’t you think?”
Mr. O sighed.
“Miss Monday, I’m sure you know better than anyone the dangers of your work. But you don’t understand quite the extent of the situation. Sarcasm, denial. These won’t save you from the living dead.”
The frown lines on Miss Monday’s face deepened.
“I don’t know why I’m sitting here listening to this nonsense,” she said. “You’re very charming, Mr. O, and your words have a ring of truth to them. Everything you say is utterly logical and entirely undeniable, given the ridiculous assumption that the monstrous dead are real. You do realise that if I fail to fulfil my obligation to my clients, they really will try to kill me, don’t you? Of course, they’ll use guns, Mr. O. They won’t use monster hunting aristocrats with whom they’ve had a falling out and whom they’ve transformed into the very monster he is purported to hunt. Honestly, the least you could do is to come up with a more believable lie.”
“I’m not lying,” he said, “But I don’t expect you to take my word for it.” He surprised her by smiling gently, looking her in the eye with an expression on his face that struck Miss Monday as naively hopeful. “All I’m asking is that you defer your delivery while I prove to you that the unliving are real. If I can do that, then you must concede that my story is true. Should I fail to convince you, you may then feel free to make your delivery as planned. Your clients can wait a few days, can they not?”
She let out a sarcastic laugh. “As I said before, Mr. O, even a thief has a reputation to keep. Imagine mine, should I fail to fulfil my end of the bargain. Even if I eventually do make the delivery, my reputation would nonetheless be tarnished.”
“Correct me if I am mistaken, Miss Monday,” Mr. O replied, “But after completing a mission successfully, you make your appearance at Hyde Park in order to deliver the package. You circle the grounds once, on horseback, signalling that you are ready to make the delivery. You then leave the package at a designated location, and return your horse to the stable. Having watched from a distance in order to maintain their anonymity, your clients wait until you’ve gone in order to retrieve the package. As you said, you never meet them face to face.”
He said all this as a statement of fact, not as a question. Miss Monday nodded her affirmation. She had no idea where he got his information, but he wasn’t wrong about a single detail.
“So we know that your client has eyes in Hyde Park today. We can safely assume that you have been seen with me. At the very least, they’ll have noticed my airship flying overhead. Likely, you were also seen being pursued by those thugs I suspect must be hired by your own mysterious clients. All these factors add up to a convenient excuse for you not to make your delivery on this day. To be truthful, would it not be more suspicious to complete your delivery as expected, despite knowing that you have been followed?”
She sighed. She was annoyed that he was right. Why did he always have to be right? I must be insane, she thought.
“A few days? Let’s say three, shall we?” she assented at last.
“I shouldn’t need so long, but I thank you just the same.”
“I must confess I can’t imagine you will be able to convince me. I mean really. The Society of Immortals? Unliving monsters? You must think I’m truly daft.”
“Oh that’s right. You still believe Lord Connor was merely sick,” said Mr. O. He stood up from the bench. He extended her a gloved hand, and helped her to pack up their picnic.
“Perhaps I won’t be able to convince you,” he admitted, “But I shall give it my best shot.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Synopsis>Roderick’s young lover visits the police station to deliver Roderick’s message, but the station has been overrun by the Unliving. Everywhere he turns, the creatures are there. At last, an ornithopter descends. A man in a plague mask invites him aboard.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Rémy looked up at the imposing rear door of 4 Whitehall Place, which served as the public entrance to the building. While the house had a Whitehall address, the door stood facing an infamous backstreet, Great Scotland Yard. Rémy had spent most of his adult life avoiding the police, so it seemed a bit odd to be seeking them out now. But then, Roderick worked closely with the police, and Rémy trusted Roderick with his life. By association then, Roderick’s police contact, Inspector Taggert, could be trusted.
The station was uncommonly dark, its windows unlit by lamp or candle. The fog that had been persisting, these past few days, didn’t help matters in that regard. The dark was almost tangible. Not a single street lamp lit the little backstreet either.
But it was neither the dark, nor the expectation of confronting the police that gave Rémy pause as he stood outside. It was the crows, which had settled on a leafless tree just across the street, its gnarled branches extended like twisted fingers. He counted six of them, perched on the upper branches of the tree, staring down at him, unblinking. Already somewhat superstitious by nature, Rémy was further unsettled by that uncanny stare. It seemed so unnatural, the crows so lifeless in their regard of him. While ordinarily they might have cawed at him, or flitted about, idly flapping their wings or shifting from foot to foot, these were utterly motionless. Their eyes, too, were unnatural, more like little lightbulbs than eyes. They were glowing. Red. He made a shooing motion at them, but they failed to react.
With a shrug, the boy turned from the crows and approached the door. He knocked at the door, glancing on his shoulder to check on the crows and finding they hadn’t moved. When no answer came at the door, he tried the handle. The door swung open. Suddenly, the crows took flight. Rémy shrieked and closed the door. He put a hand to his heart and put his back against the door.
“Pardon me,” he said in his most masculine voice, puffing out his chest. Assuming his customary confidence and a dandyish posture, he sashayed, rather than walked, into the police headquarters, calling out for the attention of a policeman. “Officers? Anyone?”
He gave a little laugh of quiet amusement.
“Doesn’t anyone work here?”
No one answered, but he heard the sound of somebody’s footsteps, the distinct scrape of a chair leg on a wooden floor. It seemed to be coming from the room to Andrew’s right. He put his hand on the latch of the door to the adjacent room. He could make out the silhouette of a man through a pane of glass in the door. He raised a hand, giving an uncertain wave to the man in the room. He turned the latch, as the man hurried to greet him. The door opened inward, and the man stumbled into it, as clumsily as if he were drunk.
“Officer?”
Rémy leaned in through the doorway, and caught a whiff of the policeman’s horrid stench. He smelled like the dead. Rémy recoiled from the offensive smell, stifling the scent by pulling his ascot up over his nose. Politeness be damned, there was no excusing such a smell. The policeman at last found his way around the door, giving the boy a good look at his face. His eyes widened.
No wonder the smell! The policeman had some kind of affliction. His face looked to be rotting away. Great chunks of skin were missing from his cheeks and brow, revealing grey-black layers of muscle and bone beneath the skin. There were maggots writhing in the gangrenous wounds in his neck, and sickly yellow pus leaking from a deep gash in his shoulder that looked like a bite had been taken out of him. Rémy felt a wave of nausea come over him, but he swallowed it and took a prudent step back from the infected policeman. He had no interest in catching that disease.
“Good god, what’s happened to you?” he said, backing away as the man continued to approach. The policeman put a hand out as if to touch him, forcing Rémy to increase his pace. He bumped into a wall, and the man nearly managed to touch him.
“I’ll fetch a doctor,” he said.
“Unghhh,” was all the man seemed capable of saying.
“Right then,” said Rémy, with some sarcasm. “If you’ll excuse me…”
He reached for the latch of the back door, when suddenly the sick man lunged at him. Rémy ducked away from his grasp and pivoted around him. The man crashed into the door, blocking Andrew’s exit.
“I’ll just use the front door then, shall I? Exit onto Whitehall?”
“Nnghh,” said the infected man.
Rémy took a moment to get another look at him, trying to determine if this might be Roderick’s Inspector Taggert. He did have a moustache, which was how Roderick had described him, but Roderick had also said that the inspector was somewhat handsome. It was difficult to tell if this creature had once been handsome, but in spite of the disease that had claimed most of his face, Rémy thought he might have been. But then, it hadn’t been long since Roderick had last seen Taggert. Surely no disease could change a man so drastically in such a short time.
With that in mind, he turned away from this man, hurrying down the hallway, keeping an eye on the sick wretch, who stumbled along clumsily after him. He peered into doorways along the way, finding the police station largely abandoned.
Then, as he exited the hallway, entering into wide foyer, he found them. The rest of the policemen, a few civilians among them, judging by their clothing. Like the one behind him, they were sick. Their skin was rotten. The stench in this room caused bile to rise in Andrew’s throat, as the creatures turned as one to look at him. Their mouths opened, and the gesture seemed almost hungry to Rémy.
There was blood on the walls and floor, spilling over desks and onto the floor. There were severed body parts littering the room and in the hands of some of the sick individuals, clutched greedily to their chests as if they might be stolen away. Some of the men were missing arms, hands, and even legs. Some of them had gaping holes in their stomachs and chests, and were trailing organs.
Rémy stumbled back, letting out a frightened gasp. He felt cold hands on his shoulders and away, batting frantically at the wretch’s hands, as if he’d run into a cobweb and had a fear of spiders. At last he managed to dislodge the hands from his shoulders. He twisted away, pushing past as the sick man snarled and bit at him.
The others dropped their pieces of flesh and began rushing towards him, mob-like in their intent. Growling, more like animals than people, they moved as one, slowly at first, but like a freight train began to pick up speed until they were a mass of rotting flesh moving steadily down the hall towards him.
He grasped at the door handle, flung it open, and hurried out onto the street. He slammed the door shut, and the mob crashed into it, causing the wood to splinter with their combined impact. Not waiting to see if they would manage to break it down, Rémy hurried down the street. Much as he loved Roderick, his message would have to remain undelivered.
He stumbled into the street, dizzily glancing over his shoulder at the door to Scotland Yard. It shuddered again, and he heard the sound of cracking wood, but it held.
His knees buckled, and he vomited on the sidewalk, bracing himself against the wall of the police station. When he was done, he got to his feet, wiped his mouth on his sleeve, and started walking.
He’d gone several blocks before his mind started working again and he realised where he was heading. He was en route to Roderick’s home. He felt a bit embarrassed at this realisation, that rather than seeking out a policeman or a doctor, he sought the comfort of his lover’s arms. He doubted Roderick would appreciate the sentiment either. As far as Roderick was concerned, Rémy was a model. Sure, they also enjoyed a more intimate relationship, but that hardly gave Rémy the right to call on him unannounced. Still, he carried on in the same direction anyway.
Suddenly, he heard screaming. The sound had come from behind him. He saw, through the fog and the dim light of an oil lamp, a group of infected men attacking a young woman. Her shrill cries cut short as they bit into her throat. She twitched, as they tore pieces of flesh from her body, thrusting them into their mouths, and then she became still.
They must have escaped the police station after all, Rémy thought, watching the horror silently from a distance. Quietly, careful not to draw their attention, he continued onward, watching over his shoulder to be sure they didn’t notice him, but after the woman grew still, they lost interest in her, and began to spread out again. And then, something remarkable happened. The woman got up.
Rémy stopped. It was one thing to try to save his own skin when there was nothing he could do to save her. But the infected had left her, and she was still alive. He turned around, quietly making his way back to where she stood, dazed, staring blankly at him.
“Miss,” he said quietly, his voice almost a whisper. “Are you alright? Do you need help?”
She stared silently back, not saying a word. He put a hand on her shoulder to get her attention. She must have been in shock. She twitched at his touch, and looked up at him, her expression dark and hungry.
Rémy stepped back. The woman wasn’t rotten, or dripping pus, but she was clearly infected. She had that same vacant, dead-eyed stare. Her voice was that same hungry growl that seemed to come from ravaged lungs, an animalistic keening.
He ran.
Enough of this, he thought. The men who’d attacked the woman turned back at the sound of Andrew’s footfalls as he tore down the cobblestone street, but they were clumsy and sick and couldn’t match his pace, though they gave chase. He left them behind, pausing to catch his breath as he rounded a street corner.
When they began to catch up again, he resumed his sprint. It was only a few more blocks to Roderick’s house. He only hoped that Roderick would be home by now.
There were other pedestrians along the way, but Rémy avoided them, paranoid that they might be sick. Not letting anything else distract him, he reached Roderick’s place in a few minutes. He banged on the door.
No answer, other than the excited yipping of Bailey, who scratched frantically at the door.
“Good dog,” he said. “Go on and fetch your master.”
The dog continued to scratch at the door, whimpering and barking. Obviously the dog remembered Rémy, but it seemed like Roderick must not be home. If he was, Bailey would certainly have roused his attention.
A few distant silhouettes began shuffling their way towards him, seemingly attracted by the sound of the dog barking. As they drew closer, he began to suspect that they were infected. Perhaps this disease hadn’t originated with the policemen, he thought. It seemed to be spread throughout the city. Everywhere he turned, the infected seemed to follow.
He pulled Roderick’s note from his pocket. The infected were quickly closing in on him. If it was the last thing he did, he would let Roderick know that he’d been there, and that he’d failed to deliver his message. He flipped open the message, and quickly read through it for the last time.
“Charles G, ran newspaper, reported on Resurrectionists. Silenced. Lord C, defected Resurrectionist? Infection deliberate, effectively silenced. Parson S, murder hobbyist, took an interest in Resurrectionists. Silenced. Think who else may be a threat to the Resurrectionists. Your life may be in danger. Take care. Roderick.”
The abbreviated names, while they were likely to mean something to Inspector Taggert, were lost on Rémy. But a few phrases resonated. Infection deliberate. Could that refer to the infection Rémy had just witnessed? Could someone really intentionally spread this infection, he wondered. Your life in danger. Well, Scotland Yard had indeed been hit by the infection. If the infection was indeed deliberate, then Roderick had been right. If only Rémy could have gotten the message there sooner.
The sound of a steam engine interrupted Andrew’s thoughts as he folded the sheet of paper and stooped to slide it under the door. He looked around for whatever machine the engine was powering, and was surprised to discover that the sound was coming from above.
Through the fog, the steam-powered machine emerged. It was roughly the size of a cabriolet, spherical in shape, and on each side it had a huge pair of canvas wings, lined with metal. With each chug of the steam engine, the wings flapped clumsily, like the wings of an enormous albatross.
The ornithopter descended, and Rémy could see its passengers through a rounded window that lined its front side. Two gentlemen in the crow-like masks of plague doctors. But even with the strange mask on, Rémy could recognize his lover. Roderick was far too much the dandy not to be recognised, even with his face completely covered. Andrew’s heart leapt.
The great machine landed in front of Roderick’s house, and a door opened. Roderick stepped down, brandishing his cane like a weapon. He tipped his hat at Rémy, raised the sword-tipped point of his cane, and thrust it into the skull of the nearest infected. The creature fell to the ground
“Rémy, my dear boy!” he said affectionately, his voice muffled by the strange mask.
“You remembered my name,” said Rémy with a laugh.
Roderick opened his arms, and Rémy practically fell into them. He looked up at Roderick and gave him an earnest look, trying to peer through the lenses that covered his eyes.
“Of course I did!” Roderick protested.
“You never have before,” Rémy reminded him, though his tone was gentle, teasing.
“We don’t have time for this,” said Roderick’s companion, an elderly gentleman, to judge from his voice and his stooped posture. “In case you hadn’t noticed, this city’s going to hell, even as we speak.”
He gestured around them to illustrate his point. The infected were still closing in on them, shuffling awkwardly on their stiff limbs, their bodies ravaged and broken. But while they were slow and clumsy, their pace was steady, their arrival inevitable.
“Alright, alright,” Roderick relented. “Let me just grab Bailey and we’ll be on our way.”
Roderick gave Rémy a pat on the shoulder and stepped past him. He unlocked the door and let Bailey out. The dog yipped excitedly, dancing little circles in front of his master. His tail wagged happily.
“Happy to see you too, my old friend,” he said, scooping up the little dog into his arms. “Come on then.”
With that, he took Rémy by the hand and led him to the ornithopter’s steps. Rémy climbed inside, took Bailey off of Roderick’s hands, and settled into a seat as Roderick clambered in after him.
As the door closed, the infected closed in on the flying machine. Roderick shouted for them to take off, and a moment later, the pilot complied. Rémy felt a twinge in his stomach as they lifted off the ground. The infected outstretched their arms, reaching up into the sky after them, but the ornithopter was beyond their reach. The infected creatures on the ground grew smaller and smaller, until they were as tiny as toys, and then until they disappeared into the fog and the dark.</Text>

            <Title>The Etiquette of Calling</Title>
            <Text>It is customary, according to the code of etiquette, to call all the hours of daylight morning, and after nightfall evening. In making a formal call, a lady does not remove her bonnet or wraps. A gentleman, making a formal call in the morning, must retain his hat in his hand. He may leave his umbrella and cane in the hall, but not his hat and gloves. The fact of retaining his hat indicates a formal call.
When a gentleman accompanies a lady at a morning call (which is seldom), he assists her up the steps, rings the bell, and follows her into the reception room. It is for the lady to determine when they should leave.
Calls from people living in the country are expected to be longer and less ceremonious than from those in the city.

What Should Be Avoided When Calling

	•	Do not stare around the room
	•	Do not take a dog or small child.
	•	Do not lay aside the bonnet at a formal call.
	•	Do not fidget with your cane, hat, or parasol.
	•	Do not make a call of ceremony on a wet day.
	•	Do not touch the piano, unless invited to do so.
	•	Do not handle ornaments or furniture in the room.
	•	Do not make a display of consulting your watch.
	•	Do not go to the room of an invalid, unless invited.
	•	Do not continue the call longer when conversation begins to lag.
	•	Do not remain when you find the lady upon the point of going out.
	•	Do not open or shut doors or windows or alter the arrangement of the room.

A gentleman, though a stranger, may with propriety escort an unattended lady to the carriage, and afterward return to make his farewell bow to the hostess.
Unless invited to do so, it is a violation of etiquette to draw near the fire for the purpose of warming one’s self. Should you, while waiting the appearance of the hostess, have done so, you will arise upon her arrival, and then take the seat she may assign you.
When a lady has set apart a certain evening for receiving calls, it is not usual to call at other times, except if the excuse should be business reasons.
All uncouth and ungraceful positions are especially unbecoming among ladies and gentlemen in the parlor. Thus, standing with the arms akimbo, sitting astride a chair, wearing a hat, leaning back in the chair, standing with legs crossed, feet on the chairs, and smoking in the presence of ladies—all those acts evince lack of polished manners.
The practice of issuing personal notes of invitation, which is sometimes done, to a list of gentleman acquaintances, stating that certain ladies will receive is not to be recommended. It looks very much like begging the gentleman to come and see them; moreover, should the practice generally prevail, it would, in a brief time, abolish New Year’s calls altogether, as gentlemen would not feel at liberty to make calls unless personally invited.
It is customary for the ladies who announce that they will receive to make their parlors attractive on that day, and present themselves in full dress. No intoxicating drinks should be allowed.

What Should Be Avoided When Calling
	•	Do not enter a room without first knocking and receiving an invitation to come in
	•	Do not walk around the room, examining pictures, while waiting for the hostess
	•	Do not introduce politics, religion, or weighty topics for conversation when making calls
	•	Do not call upon a person in reduced circumstances with a display of wealth, dress, and equipage
	•	Do not tattle. Do not carry gossip from one family to another
	•	Do not, if a gentleman, seat yourself upon the sofa beside the hostess, or in near proximity, unless invited to do so
	•	Do not, if a lady, call upon a gentleman (except officially or professionally) unless he may be a confirmed invalid
	•	Do not take a strange gentleman with you, unless positively certain that his introduction will be received with favor

            <Title>The Etiquette of Visiting</Title>
            <Text>Before making a visit, you should be perfectly certain that your visit will be agreeable. It is common for some people to be very cordial, and even profuse in their offers of hospitality. They unquestionably mean what they say at the time, but when they tender you an invitation to come, and you tarry for weeks, it may seriously incommode them if you should pay them a visit of even a few days.
If no previous understanding has been had, the visit should be limited to three days, or a week at most.
While husbands and wives are always expected to accompany each other, where either may be invited, it is a trespass upon the generosity of the friend to take children and servants unless they are included in the invitation.

General Rules of Etiquette
	•	Never send your guest, who is accustomed to a warm room, off into a cold, damp, spare bed to sleep
	•	Never cross your legs and put out one foot in the street-car aisle or places where it will trouble others when passing by
	•	Never examine the cards in the card-basket. While they may be exposed in the drawing-room, you are not expected to turn them over unless invited to do so.
	•	Never should a lady accept expensive gifts at the hands of a gentleman not related or engaged to her. However, gifts of flowers, books, music, or confectionery may be accepted

You should not treat your friend’s house as if it was a hotel, making your calls, visiting, transacting business about the town, and coming and going at all hours to suit your own convenience. Having received intelligence of the expected arrival of a guest, have a carriage at the depot to meet the friend. Various members of the family being with the carriage will make the welcome more pleasant.
Take the baggage-checks, and give personal attention to having the trunks conveyed to your residence, relieving the guest of all care in the matter.
Have a warm, pleasant room especially prepared for the guest, with the dressing table being supplied with water, soap, towel, comb, hair-brush, brush-broom, hat-brush, pomade, cologne, matches, needles, and pins.</Text>

	Occupation:	
 	

Physical Description:	Beautiful, fair, and elegant.

Personality:		Kind, gentle-tempered, she possesses a naive wonderment—a certain joie-de-vivre—that Parson finds captivating. Sensitive, shy, and young, Rachelle is truly Parson’s opposite in almost every sense. Like Parson, she is beautiful, intelligent, and wealthy.

	Habits/Mannerisms:	
 	

Background:		Camille Vincent is Parson Sinews’ beautiful fiancée. Sinews would jokingly state that he had never meant to fall in love but that it could not be avoided. In his words, “I'm all for romance; it's love I'm against. Love makes moths of us all, and none can resist its flame.”  Camille, a Parisian migrated to London, is also a scientist, and a Resurrectionist.  She is as deceptive as she is beautiful, a sociopath so committed to the pursuit of science that she is willing to do anything and betray anyone so long as her research can continue unhindered.

            <Title>Scene 37</Title>
            <Synopsis>Roderick, Taggert, and Hargrave search for Parson Sinews in the prison, and encounter zombie prisoners. </Synopsis>
            <Text>Though he had never had occasion to visit Newgate, through his association with Parson Sinews, who had visited the prison to attend a number of hangings, Roderick had a vague understanding of its layout. This wasn’t Taggert’s first visit to the prison, nor Mr. Hargrave’s. Still, Roderick led the way, the two policemen following close behind as they climbed the short staircase. He paused at the top of the stairs and motioned for the policemen to do the same.
Before rounding the corner, he took a moment to listen. It was eerily quiet. Roderick realized, in the silence, that his heart was racing. He half expected to round the corner and find himself face to face with another zombie. But so far the zombies hadn’t proven to be stealthy hunters. They clumsily stumbled towards their prey. He should be able to hear them before he ran into them, so long as he was took his time and didn’t rush in. Still, he couldn’t shake the feeling that he was heading in to certain danger.
At last, certain that the coast was clear, he rounded the corner. No zombies loomed in front of him. He motioned for the policemen to follow, and headed into the passage. His footsteps echoed against the bare walls. The floor was cold and hard on his bare feet.
Proceeding slowly, taking care to pause and listen for signs of movement before rounding any corners, they encountered only a few zombies along the way. They dealt with these easily enough, though each time they came across one of the wretched creatures, Roderick’s heart would pound so hard against his chest it was painful. At last, they reached the ward for male felons, and heard a mass of voices.
At first, Roderick couldn’t tell if the prisoners were alive or dead, but as he listened, he began to detect the telltale signs—the inhuman moans, the gurgling sounds of creatures trying to speak with lungs blackened by rot, the snarling, animalistic howls of hunger.
“They might not all be zombies,” Roderick said quietly, “But at least some of them are.”
He took comfort in the knowledge that their prisoners were locked in their cells, and rounded the corner.
“Let’s see if Mr. Sinews made it here in one piece, shall we?”</Text>

            <Title>Scene Four</Title>
            <Text>Cold surgical steel sliced into rotten flesh, cutting through gristle and tendons as easily as carving a roast. Slabs of rotting meat began to pile up in the doorway, but still, they pressed forward. Annabel tried to get a count, but it was impossible to gauge how many there were with the door half-closed and their grunting, snarling faces so close to her own.
She planted a firm kick at one that had gotten too close for comfort, sending him sprawling backwards, but another one took his place. Intestines dangling, utterly naked, with blood in her blond hair, the zombie snapped her teeth, inches from Annabel’s neck. She heard a cry of pain from beside her, Abraham’s voice, but she had her own problems. She thrust her blade into the woman’s skull, heard the crunch of bone and brain, and moved on.
Killing the zombies was simple enough, once she had the hang of it. She only had to destroy the brain. Any other wound would not suffice. Destroy the brain, and the body would go limp, cease attacking.
Easier said than done. Annabel grabbed the hilt of her blade, pulled it from the skull of her latest kill, and went for the next one. Her blade caught him beneath his jaw, aimed upward into the brain. He went limp. Again, she set her sights on another that had gotten too close, pulled the blade from the man’s jaw.
She cried out as two zombies grabbed her at once, one of them by the hair, the other by her right arm. The blade clattered to the floor and disappeared as the zombies climbed over it. She felt another set of hands seize her as she fought to fend them off.
Her hair had come loose, as the walking corpse had gotten hold of it, and it was in her face. He was pulling at it, trying to bring her head closer to his gaping mouth. The other one was trying to get at her throat, but she was holding him off with her arm.
The third one had suddenly let her go, and she heard the disturbing slop of something juicy being eaten. She couldn’t see what it was with her hair in her face, but she detected the smell of warm blood mingled with the smell of rot. She heard the crunch of gnashing teeth, the moans of contentment for the unliving.
She started to scream, but she knew there was nobody to help her now. It was Abraham that was being eaten. Her screams fell silent, turned into a whimper as they began to finish their meal and set their blood-wet fingers on her cheeks and on her neck.
She raised her arm. It was all she could do to keep that one from getting at her neck. She felt a clump of hair tear out of her scalp, but suddenly she could see again. See the unliving man’s jaws close around her arm. He clamped down until his rotten teeth ripped throat her shirt and into her arm.
Suddenly, she heard gunfire, and she felt the cold hands being pried off of her. She dealt with the one on her arm, punching him with her left until his face caved in and he stumbled back. She broke his legs with a sharp kick, and he fell to the ground. With a cry of rage and adrenaline, she stomped on his skull with her boot, killing him.
Panting for breath, her face and hair slick with cold wet blood, she turned to her saviour. For a moment, she’d thought it might have been Abraham, not dead after all, but it was Mr. O she found before her. He was looking at her with a mixture of horror and relief. She offered him a smile, which given her current state, was probably not very comforting.
“Not that I’m unhappy to see you, but what are you doing here?” she said, relief actually creeping into her voice.
Ignoring the question, he took a cautious step towards her.
“You’ve been bitten,” he said. There was no question in his voice. He’d seen the zombie biting into her arm.
“I’m fine,” she said.
She took a moment to survey the room. The scientists were all dead, with the exception of Dr. Simms, who was cowering beneath one of the hospital beds. There were still zombies strapped to the beds. There was blood everywhere, and body parts and corpses littered the floor. Abraham’s body was unrecognizable amidst the pile of bodies. She shuddered and turned away. She felt like she might be sick.
“Let me see your arm,” Mr. O persisted.
“I said I’m fine.”
“I must insist,” said Mr. O, “You do realise that a bite from one of these creatures can be fatally infectious? If your skin is punctured…”
She looked up from her task. She’d found a rag amongst the scientific equipment, and after wiping the blood from her face, was using it to clean her boots. She fixed him with a deadly stare. “I’m. Fine.”
Apparently not being one to back down, he ignored the warning in her voice. “We don’t know for certain that you’re immune,” he said, concern written all over his face. “Please, just quit being stubborn and let me examine you.”
“He’s right, you know,” said Dr. Simms, coming out from beneath the metal cot. “If you’ve been bitten, and if you’ve been infected, it’s possible we can still stop the infection from spreading if we amputate.”
Finally, Miss Monday relented. She began by peeling off her glove. “Little late for that,” she said, scoffing.
“It may very well be,” Mr. O replied, managing to sound both sarcastic and concerned for her welfare.
Then she drew back her sleeve, and he fell silent.
He stared at her quietly, as he suddenly understood her reluctance to allow him to examine her arm. As she’d said, there was no cause for concern about the bite.
Her arm was a prosthetic. Like the clockwork eye she strapped to her face each morning, it was made of mechanical parts. Gears which clicked as she rotated her forearm, hydraulics which hissed as she flexed her artificial muscles. Gears clicked with the steady rhythm of a clock each time she rotated her wrist. Each joint bore a keyhole. The key with which she wound her clockwork eye was a perfect fit for her arm as well.
It was made of copper and brass, with the same extraordinary workmanship as her mechanical eye. It moved with quiet motions, even as the gears whirred and clicked. She demonstrated the dexterity in her hand by flexing each of her fingers in turn, clenching her hand into a fist.
“See,” she said, “No bite marks.”
In awe, Mr. O reached out a hand to touch her arm.
“Don’t,” she warned him.
He retracted his hand.
“Sorry,” he said. “It’s just…”
“What?” she said, covering up her arm again with her sleeve. “Freakish? Inhuman?”
“Fascinating,” he murmured. He was looking at her in a way that she found unsettling. Unsettling in that it was sincere, honest, and—dare she think it—affectionate.
She blushed. No one had ever looked at her in this way, not after they’d seen her arm. Most men blanched at the sight of her eye, and the scar that ran down the length of her face. She was pretty, sure, but she was also disfigured. If the eye wasn’t enough to turn people away, her arm most certainly was.
But Mr. O reached out, gently, and touched her cheek. She flushed, hot, and felt her heart flutter in her chest.
“You’re not a freak,” said Mr. O. “You’re extraordinary.”
He put his hand against the back of her neck, leaned in close, and let his lips linger half an inch from hers.
Almost against her will, she reached out in return, and pressed her brass hand against the back of his neck, pressed her body close to his, and pressed her lips against his. She felt too vulnerable, too exposed, with her arm uncovered like this.
Her breath caught in her throat, and she felt a warmth in her very bones, as he returned her kiss. Her heart pounded, and she felt her cheeks flush, red-hot. It started as a gentle kiss, his lips tenderly caressing hers, but it quickly gave way to passion and fire, and he kissed her roughly, grasping her by the back of the head tightly.
Maddeningly, he suddenly pulled away from her, but it was only to catch his breath. Then he leaned back in and began to plant kisses upon her neck, small wet kisses that moved their way up her neck and caused her to grasp the hair on the back of his neck and press herself as close to him as she could. She pressed her left hand against his hip, and she moaned softly as his teeth tugged at the lobe of her ear.
He put his hand upon her arm. She couldn’t feel it there, not exactly, but she felt a slight pressure in her shoulder, where the prosthesis was affixed to her flesh.
After a moment, she drew back and looked at him like an addict might look at a bottle of absinthe. With a mixture of wariness and attraction. She staggered back and looked about in horror.
“My god,” she said. “Such horror abounds, and yet here we are. Locking lips while the plague spreads. We must truly be deviants.”
“I’m sorry,” he told her.
“Don’t be,” Annabel replied, leaning towards him once more, much to Dr. Simms loudly vocalized discomfort. “I’m afraid I rather liked it.”</Text>

            <Title>The Etiquette of The Table</Title>
            <Text>The dinner hour will completely test the refinement, culture, and good breeding that the individual may possess. To appear advantageously at the table, the person must not only understand the laws of etiquette, but he must have the advantage of polite society. It is the province of this chapter to show what the laws of the table are. It will be the duty of the reader, in the varied relations of life, to make such use of them as circumstances shall permit.

Etiquette For Hosts and Hostesses

Having determined upon the number of guests to be invited, the next thing in order will be the issuing of notes of invitation by special messenger, which should be sent out ten or twelve days before the dinner is given.
For a very pleasant social affair the rule is not to have the company when seated exceed twelve in number. None of them should be conspicuously superior to the others, and all should be from the same circle of society.
The hour having arrived, the host offers his right arm to the most honoured or possibly the eldest lady guest, and the gentleman most distinguished will escort the lady of the house.
Let us hope if there is any carving, it will be done before the meat is brought to the table, and the time of the company saved from this sometimes slow and tedious work.
It is customary for the gentleman who is the head of the household, in the ordinary family circle, to sit at the side of the table, in the centre, having plates at his right hand, with food nearby. When all the family are seated, and all is in readiness, he will serve the eldest lady of the household, and then the ladies and gentlemen as they come in order.
The hostess will sit opposite her husband, and preside of the tea, sauces, etc.

Behaviour To Be Avoided At the Table

	•	Never open your mouth when chewing
	•	Never make noises with the mouth or throat
	•	Never leave the table with food in the mouth
	•	Never tip the back in your chair nor lounge upon the table
	•	Never permit yourself to use gestures, nor illustrations made with a knife or fork on the tablecloth
	•	Never hold bones in your fingers while you eat from them
	•	Never encourage a dog or cat to play with you at the table
	•	Never explain at the table why certain foods do not agree with you
	•	Never pick your teeth or put your hand in your mouth while eating
	•	Never wipe your fingers on the tablecloth, nor clean them in your mouth. Use the napkin. 

Etiquette For Guests

It is of the utmost importance that all of the company be punctual, arriving from ten to fifteen minutes before the appointed time. To be ten minutes late, keeping the dinner waiting, is a serious offence which no one should be guilty of.
Sit upright, neither too close nor too far away from the table. Open and spread upon your lap or breast a napkin if one is provided—otherwise a handkerchief. Do not be in haste; compose yourself; put your mind into a pleasant condition, and resolve to eat slowly.
Keep the hands from the table until your time comes to be served. It is rude to take knife and fork in hand and commence drumming on the table while you are waiting. Eccentricity should be avoided as much as possible at the table.
Possibly grace will be said by someone present, and the most respectful attention and quietude should be observed until the exercise is passed.
It is the most appropriate time, while you wait to be served, for you to put into practice your knowledge of small talk and pleasant words with those whom you are sitting near.
Do not be impatient to be served. WIth social chitchat and eating, the meal-time should always be prolonged from thirty minutes to an hour.
If soup comes first, and you do not desire it, you will simply say, “No, I thank you,” but make no comment; or you may take it and eat as little as you choose.
The soup should be eaten with a medium-sized spoon, so slowly and carefully that you will drop none upon your person or the tablecloth.
Making an effort to get the last drop, and all unusual noise when eating, should be avoided.
If furnished with potatoes in small dishes, you will put the skins back into the dish again; and thus where there are side dishes all refuse should be placed in them. Otherwise potato-skins will bee placed upon the tablecloth, and bones upon the side of the plate. If possible, avoid putting waste matter upon the cloth.
The gentleman, when a dish is brought, having seen the lady he escorted provided for, will help himself and pass it on. He will pay no attention to the other lady near him, but will lleave that to her escort. In all cases he will be attentive to the wants of the lady in his charge, ascertaining her wishes and issuing her orders to the waiters.
No polite guest will ever fastidiously smell or examine any article of food before tasting it. Such conduct would be an insult to those who have invited him. Neither will the host or hostess apologize for the cooking.
Etiquette demands that each member of the company remain at least an hour after the dinner is finished, it being impolite to hurry away immediately.
Never expectorate at the table; also avoid sneezing or coughing. It is better to arise quietly from the table if you have occasion to do either. A sneeze is prevented by placing the finger firmly on the upper lip.
Never spit out bones, cherry pits, grape skins, etc., upon your plate. Quietly press them from your mouth upon your fork, and lay them upon the side of your plate.
Never allow the conversation at the table to drift into anything but chitchat. The consideration of deep and abstruse principles will impair digestion.

Behaviour To Be Avoided At the Table

	•	Never allow butter, soup, or other food to remain on your whiskers.
	•	Never wear gloves at the table, unless your hands for some special reason are unfit to be seen.
	•	Never, when serving others, overload the plate nor force upon them delicacies which they decline.
	•	Never make a display when removing hair, insects, or other disagreeable things from your food. Place them quietly under the edge of your plate.

            <Title>The Etiquette of The Street</Title>
            <Text>Ladies and gentlemen, when meeting on the sidewalk, should always pass to the right. Should the sidewalk be narrow or dangerous, gentlemen will see that ladies are protected from injury.
In the evening, or whenever safety may require, a gentleman should give a lady his arm. It is not customary in other cases to do so on the street, unless with an elderly lady, or the couple be husband and wife.
A gentleman may take two ladies upon his arms, but under no circumstances should the lady take the arms of two gentlemen.
A gentleman will assist a lady over from an omnibus or carriage, without waiting for the formality of an introduction. When the service is thus performed, he will raise his hat, bow, and pass on.
No gentleman will smoke when walking with, or standing in the presence of, a lady standing in the street. He should remove the cigar from her presence entirely, even though permission may be granted to continue the smoking.
A gentleman should not bow from a window to a lady on the street, though he may bow slightly from the street upon being recognized by a lady in a window. Such recognition should, however, generally be avoided, as gossip is likely to attach undue importance to it when seen by others.
No gentleman should stand on the street corners, steps of hotels, or other public places and make remarks about ladies passing by.
A lady should have the escort of a gentleman in the evening. Gossip and scandal are best avoided, however, if she has someone from her home call for her at an appointed hour.
Ladies should avoid walking rapidly upon the street, as it is ungraceful and unbecoming. Running across the street in front of carriages is dangerous, and shows want of dignity.
Staring at people, spitting, looking back after they pass, saluting people across the street, calling out loudly, or laughing at people as they go by are all evidences of ill-breeding.
When crossing the pavement, the lady should raise her dress with the right hand, a little above the ankle. To raise the dress with both hands is vulgar, and can be excused only when the mud is very deep.
Allowing a dress to trail on the street is in exceedingly bad taste. Such a street costume simply calls forth criticism and contempt from the more sensible people.
A true lady will go quietly and unobtrusively about her business when on the street, never seeking to attract the attention of the opposite sex, at the same time recognizing acquaintances with a courteous bow, and friends with pleasant words of greeting.
Swinging the arms when walking, eating upon the street, sucking the parasol handles, pushing violently through a crowd, talking and laughing very loudly and boisterously on the streets, and whispering in public conveyances are all evidences of ill-breeding in ladies.

General Rule of Etiquette

	•	Never attempt to convey the impression that you are a genius by imitating the faults of distinguished men. Because certain great men were poor penmen, wore long hair, or had other peculiarities, it does not follow that you will be great by imitating their eccentricities.</Text>

            <Title>Scene Four</Title>
            <Synopsis>Annabel and the Penny dreadful crew continue to battle the Beast. Jonathan recklessly jumps off the dirigible in order to vanquish the creature.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Mr. O had explained that they had to stop it from reaching the border. Miss Monday couldn’t care less about any of that. But this thing had been made by Dr. Tidkins, just like the creatures on the River Thames. Just like Lord Connor. And like her, it wore the mechanical enhancements of the Doctor's creation. This was what concerned her.
On one hand, it was the mystery that drew her in. The clandestine society of boffins, the brazen murder of a member of the aristocracy, the use of zombies as weapons. It flew in the face of what she'd believed about him when they first met—that he was interested in saving lives. And on the other hand, it was that he'd tried to kill her, on several occasions now, by setting zombies upon her. Vengeance, then. That was what concerned her.
Focus, she had to remind herself. Focus.
While the monster Dr. Tidkins had set upon them appeared to be wounded, it did not seem to have noticed. It continued to unleash an unmerciful hail of bullets at the Dreadful and would probably do so until it ran out of bullets or the guns overheated, whichever came first.
She watched as Captain Merrick crawled along the floor, back to his position at the helm of the ship; bullets hailing around him be damned, he had a ship to operate. She had to admire that.
Again the ship shuddered as cannonballs launched at the roach and punctured holes into its carapace, not stopping it but at least doing damage.
Miss Monday was determined not to be the weak link in the crew. Mr. Palmer and the Captain were performing admirably, which meant that she'd better hurry if she wanted to keep up. She took a moment to brace herself against the railing, aimed and fired her blunderbuss. The projectile struck its mark and exploded, but it was little cause for celebration. Even the explosion was hardly enough to slow the beast.
She frowned. It had to be a headshot, she realised. It was easy to forget that this monster was just like any other Unliving creature. They could chop off all of its limbs, tear off its wings, and it might not even notice. It had to be a headshot. Which was easier said than done, considering that its head was entirely safe beneath its thick shell of carapace, much like the rest of its body. Except, it occurred to her, when it opened its fearsome maw and uttered its shrill, piercing cry.
“Mr. Palmer, I’m going to need you to make it angry,” said Miss Monday.
He put a hand to one ear and mouthed a single word. "Sorry?"
She swore. Of course he wouldn't be able to hear her over the sound of the bullets hammering against the ship's armour and the blustering wind as they tore through the air at high speed. She began making her way toward him, hand over hand along the railing.
The unfortunate thing was, there was a short length of the ship that was not shielded by the ship's armour. In order to reach Mr. Palmer, she would have to pass through it. She would be completely exposed to any stray bullets that might come her way.
She reached the edge of the armored section. It was only about a meter from where she stood to the next sheet of armor near Mr. Palmer’ cannon. She spared a glance up toward the monster. It was still flying steadily toward the ship, while the Penny Dreadful flew in reverse, keeping just out of its range. Its hail of bullets wasn’t letting up. Its supply of ammunition couldn’t be limitless. It would run out eventually, but she couldn’t be certain the ship would outlast it.
No choice then. She raised her right arm and used it to cover her face as best as possible, but it was her left side that would be most exposed. But she turned her head and sheltered herself as best she could. Her arm could be repaired if it was damaged. The same could not be said for her face. She dashed out from beneath the armored plate and ran for cover.
Safe. At last she reached Mr. Palmer and repeated her message.
“Consider it done,” Palmer replied, though he had no reason to be so confident. It was not as though his efforts thus far had caused any noticeable effect to the creature. Furthermore, it was not as though the creature’s disposition was at all amiable in the first place; why Miss Monday wished to provoke it further was beyond him.
But while Palmer did not comprehend Miss Monday’s motives for angering it, he nonetheless set himself to the task. He shifted his sitting position back from the gatling gun to the cannon.
“Ready?” he shouted. Even standing side by side, it was impossible to hear one another with the ship traveling at this speed.
“Wait for my signal!” she shouted back.
She needed a vantage point. If she wanted to kill this thing, her aim needed to be precise. With a sickening lurch, she realised what her best option was.
She was sure there must be some sort of nautical term for it—she’d overheard the crewmen bandying words like starboard and aft about—but she hadn’t any idea what the appropriate word might be, but the balloon was attached to the ship both by ropes and by huge towers of wood and brass. Some of these towers had footholds build in, and railings along the sides, so they could be climbed in order to perform maintenance duties upon the ship. It was unlikely that they were meant to be used while the ship was flying, in reverse, at top speed.
She swore. She could still hear through the din of battle, the sound of bullets striking metal, and more unsettling than that, the noise of metal bending and warping beneath the pressure of hundreds of bullets fired in succession.
She made her way to the ladder, if that’s what it was called, grabbed the railing, and began to climb. The tower wasn’t shielded by armor either, but there was no time to even think about that just now. Or to think about her fear of heights. She hoisted herself up onto the canvas blimp, and lay flat upon it. There were no railings up here, no handholds, and little to shield her from the wind.
The sail along the balloon’s spine had been lowered, and the shields had been raised. A grid of metal framed the canvas blimp, and sheets of armor plating were affixed in segments, attached to the metal frame in order to cover the gaps between each metal section of the frame. Each gap was about two meters square, but there were spaces that were not entirely covered. The shields were mounted on mechanical arms along the frame, intended to mitigate the risk provided by the gaps in the armor. The ship’s design was built on redundancies. Where the armor failed, the shields would still provide cover.
Miss Monday crawled her way toward one of the raised shields, grabbing the arm to which it was mounted, and used it to pull herself to her feet. She looked down at Mr. Palmer, and raised her blunderbuss, grabbing it from her holster.
In answer, Mr. Palmer began his assault, launching what seemed to be a limitless supply of cannon fodder. The Dreadful shuddered with every deafening blast of the cannon, but the beast was undeterred.
Miss Monday, perched precariously atop the balloon. She held tight to the thick shield, training her eyes on the creature.
Cannonball after cannonball, Palmer was relentless. Finally, Mr. Palmer managed to penetrate the creature’s chitinous shell, and the beast let out that terrible, unearthly wail. Miss Monday was ready.
She fired.
It only took a moment. The grenade sailed into the creature’s open jaws. She holstered the blunderbuss and unfurled her umbrella. The concussive blast of the grenade was accompanied by the sickening crunch of splintering carapace; a blast of fire erupted from the creature’s maw, taking with it a significant section of the cockroach’s head, which rained down in enormous, wet chunks.
Miss Monday let out a cry of indignation when her parasol was struck by a particularly large segment of gruesome flesh. She lost her balance, slid toward the edge of the balloon, grasping for something, anything. Her hands banged and slid against the metal plating that covered the balloon, cutting gashes into her left.
Her umbrella slipped out of her hand and blew away with frightening speed, and a moment later she lost the blunderbuss. But she finally managed to grasp something. Her legs dangled off the edge of the balloon in a way that was most unladylike.
When she finally caught her breath, she saw that it was Mr. O’s hand that she had caught.
“I’ve got you,” he said, hoisting her back up onto the relative safety of the balloon.
“Mr. O,” she said, out of breath but otherwise managing to sound entirely unshaken by the incident. “Sorry about that.”
“That’s twice now.”
She frowned. Twice that he’d saved her life. Well, he could keep on saving her life every day for a month and he’d still owe her for losing consciousness.
“It won’t happen again,” she said grumpily. “What ever are you doing up here?”
He shrugged. “I could ask you the same question,” he said. “I’ve got a plan,” he added, taking a swig from a flask he kept hidden in his vest pocket.
His face was flushed, his balance questionable at best. But it was hardly his intoxication that caught her attention. As Miss Monday looked at him and the balloons on which they stood, she began to suspect what he had been up to all this time. Whatever his plan was, it would be astoundingly dangerous. Not that she was one to complain about that. So long as his plan worked.
He had removed a large sheet of the thick armor that surrounded the blimp. If the dirigible were to be struck by stray bullet now, they’d go up in flames. But they were all doomed anyhow, if they didn’t do something. Mr. O had also unlashed some of the ropes that bound the hydrogen gasbags inside the canvas envelope. He had secured another section of rope around the middlemost balloon, and had wound a great deal of that same rope around his own body as well.
“Whatever are you planning?” Miss Monday breathed, though she was sure she’d already worked it out in her head.
“Miss Monday,” he said, slurring his words, “If you would just kindly ask the beast to fly above us, just here.” He pointed at where he wanted the creature. “I’m afraid I’ve been rather inspired by your notion of filling its mouth with incendiary devices.”
He winked.
“No,” she said. “If this gets you killed,” she started, pointing a finger at him. “I won’t have this on my head. What exactly are you planning?”
“First, I’m going to dislodge this ballonet,” he said, grinning drunkenly. “Then, I’ll just fly up into the creature’s mouth, cause the ballonet to explode, then drop back down to the ship. Easy peasy.”
Miss Monday shook her head. Aside from his notion that it would be easy, the plan wasn’t entirely ridiculous. But even if it did work, simply dropping back down to the ship would be nearly impossible.
“Lemon squeezey,” he added.
“What happens if you miss the ship?” she asked.
“Don’t worry about that,” said Mr. O. “I have exactly two contingency plans. This will work,” he assured her.
Angry though she was, Miss Monday turned back to face the demonic cockroach. Mr. Palmer had been fending it off nicely while she’d been otherwise occupied. Captain Merrick was still standing at the wheel, courageous in the face of danger. She wasn’t about to let her feelings for Mr. O, whatever those might be, get in the way of her usefulness on this mission.
“Captain!” she shouted, but her voice was drowned out by the wail of the wounded insect and the buffeting of the open air.
She started to descend the ladder. The familiar mechanical sound of gears clicking into place spurred her into quicker action. The onslaught of bullets had ceased for the moment, but already the creatures guns were whirring up for a second go at them. If the second onslaught lasted as long as the first, they wouldn’t survive it. She practically jumped down the ladder onto the deck below.
“Bring us down!” she told the captain. “Get us underneath the monster.”
He nodded, even as he carried out her instructions. She might not be a marriageable sort of woman, but Captain Merrick had to admit, she was certainly formidable. Turning his attention from Miss Monday, he began shouting orders into the speaking tube to direct his crew.
Another barrage of bullets struck the Dreadful, putting dents even in her thick shields. The ship wouldn’t hold out much longer, especially with the ballonet exposed.
“Mr. O, if you’re still intent on this idiocy, you’d best get ready,” Miss Monday shouted up at him.
A moment later, they’d managed to get under the cockroach: easier than asking it to fly above them.
For a moment, Miss Monday thought they’d been struck by something. The entire ship jolted like a boat about to capsize. Captain Merrick clutched the wheel and did his best to steady the vessel. From somewhere within the ship they could hear the unusual sound of intense friction.
Then, another jolt, and the ship began to lose altitude. The captain cursed, shouted for the engineers to check on the barometer or the difference engine or whatever else it was that would keep them aloft. They weren’t about to crash, but they were descending far too quickly and suddenly for the captain’s liking. A moment later, he discovered the cause of their descent.
Above them, one of the ship’s own balloons had come free and was spiralling up toward the monster.
“What on earth…” he began. Then the light of the dreadful’s lantern fell upon the rogue ballonet, and he saw.
It was Mr. O. He had attached himself to the balloon and was attempting to steer the balloon with the weight of his body, aiming straight for the gaping hole in the creature’s mouth.
Shaking off his amazement, Palmer fired a few shots as cover fire.
Miss Monday’s heart caught in her chest. She grabbed one of the lanterns that hung from the ship, and aimed it at Mr. O, keeping him bathed in light.
“Idiot,” she cursed him.
The balloon found its mark. In one simultaneous motion, Mr. O hurled a grenade into the creature’s jaws and cut himself loose. Down, down toward The Penny Dreadful he fell.
He would have made it too, landing straight on the deck of the airship. Suddenly, the explosion of the hydrogen balloon lit the night sky, throwing Mr. O’s horribly off course.
Blood and severed body parts rained down from the monstrous cockroach. The crew watched as Mr. O plummeted toward the ground.
Miss Monday’s heart sank.
“By God!” Lockwood exclaimed from within the crew cabin, loud enough to be heard outside.
They shared his sentiment, but there was nothing to be done. Not a word was spoken. Not a breath was breathed.</Text>

            <Text>Parson Sinews

	Role in Story:
	Protagonist/Anti-hero
	Occupation:	
Critic

Physical Description:	

Devilishly handsome, he has dark eyes and striking features, a face seemingly without even a blemish. Dark windswept hair, impeccably dressed
Personality:	

A sardonic sense of humour and a cynical disposition are Parson’s wards against his torturous passion for things of beauty: in particular, his singular love, Rachelle, the woman who (impossibly) stole his heart.
	Habits/Mannerisms:	

Parson is a gentleman in every sense of the word: utterly polite, articulate, and attentive to the wants and needs of his companions. He is quick-witted and equally quick to judge those who displease him. He has a sharp mind and a wicked temper, yet he can be incredibly gentle-mannered when it suits him.

Parson has many of the habits of an arrogant man, among them: dispensing with his own brand of wisdom. He often speaks in witticisms with any who might listen. These aphorisms may not be accurate or even truthful; they are merely Parson’s vision of the world as he sees it.

“Morality means avoiding one's pleasures, feeling guilty about enjoying oneself, allowing lawmakers to determine our actions, and behaving sensibly at all times. Therefore it is to be avoided at all costs.”

“Procrastination is not a vice. It is merely the act of putting one's idle pleasures in priority above one's responsibilities. It is one of my chiefest enjoyments.”

“Punctuality is a flaw of character; it suggests a denial of self characteristic of the meek and powerless. There is nothing as intolerable as self denial.”

“Conversation is a gateway drug.”

“Those first on the scene of the crime are always questioned but never suspected.”

“Pleasure and pain are indistinguishable, at the best of times. Even at the worst of times it would be difficult to choose a favourite.”

“To be charming without being kind is not a fault; it is a talent. To be kind without being charming; that is indeed a fault. One must always be charming, whatever the cost.”

“The worst atrocities are always done with the best of intentions.”

“When you wish to be kind, lie cunningly. When you wish to be cruel, be honest. The most cunning of lies will never bring about the tear-shed brought on by brutal honesty.”

“Honesty is not a prerequisite of kindness. There is nothing so ruthless as to tell the truth.”

“It is only by living one's life in stealth, tiptoeing through the shadows unseen and unheard that one can hope to avoid making of enemies. I dare not hope to tread so softly. One does not leave a mark on the world without a few bloodied footprints. The true measure of a man is not the number of his friends, but the number of his enemies. Henry VIII, Guy Fawkes, and Jack The Ripper, these were men with enemies; these were men of distinction.”

“The world craves the grotesque and the arabesque. Those who pretend at beauty deceive themselves.”

“The truly beautiful is tragedy.”

“One must feel the pleasure of horror and the horror of pleasure. One cannot exist without both.”

“The man who feels mirth and no sorrow is a fiction.”

“The most selfish act in the world is to bear children. The second most selfish act in the world is to not have children. The only way to do neither is to do both and that is to adopt.”

“I cannot see the allure of selflessness. Nothing is ever gained from it.”

“Money may not buy happiness, but nor can poverty. Money, at least, can buy pleasure, which is like happiness, only exaggerated and temporary. If money cannot buy happiness, let it be used for something better. Let it be spent on pleasure.”

“Debt is the privilege of the wealthy. Poor is the man who has nothing. Rich is the man who has less than nothing, for he has spent it all.”

“Honesty is overrated. Lies become us.”

“Rather the devil who lets us sin than the god who lets us supplicate.”

“Impatience is a virtue. The fates favour those who make things happen, not those who wait for things to happen.”

“Wise is the man who admits his own incompetence.”

“Depravity is an utter necessity. Without it, beauty would hold no meaning, and beauty is undeniably necessary.”

“Sincerity is a dreadful thing. One should never be sincere. One should always be fanciful. The best things in life are always full of fancy.”

“Absinthe makes the heart grow fonder.”

“Comedies always end well, but tragedies always begin well. And all things begin with beginnings.”

“Life is a game of cards. One half of it is luck. The other half is bluffing.”

“I’m all for romance; it's love I'm against. Love makes moths of us all, and none can resist its flame.”

“People will take advantage of a man's good nature. It is only by dispelling with one's own good nature that man can hope to avoid this pitfall.”

  	

	Background:	

Largely inspired by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes, Parson Sinews takes the concept of the flawed hero to a new level. Mr. Sinews is the main character in Allen’s Street – and a true antihero, if not an outright villain.

He also functions as the trope/archetype known as The Magnificent Bastard: “If there was ever a character that deserved to be called “Magnificent”, that character is the Magnificent Bastard…Bold, charismatic, independent, and audacious. Capturing the audience with his charisma, incredible intellect, mastery of manipulation, and boldness of action, this character is a show-stealer, demanding your reverence at every turn. 

“So what makes a character a Magnificent Bastard? Let's break it down: 
•	He is brilliant and utterly devious to an almost breathtaking, mind-boggling degree. Call it genius, call it virtual omniscience, but he always seems to know what everyone else is planning at any given moment, and exactly how to arrange the game so he wins even when he is defeated.

•	He is a smooth operator. He always knows exactly what to say to position you where he wants you, always has a backup strategy and never loses his cool. Even if on the remote chance something happens that wasn't in his plans, you'd never know it from his actions.

•	He has a goal, he's not going to stop until he's completed it, whatever it is. To that end he will do almost anything. He'll move heaven and hell. Despite his choice of tactics, he is rarely if ever pointlessly cruel, and has a reason for everything he does. 

•	He is charismatic, often charming, his personality like a physical force. People tend to like him, sometimes even when they know he isn't on their side, and even those who hate his guts have to admit respect. Even when at his darkest, he has traits which one can't help but admire.

Other common aspects of a Magnificent Bastard (and Parson Sinews himself) include being a “Sharp Dressed Man,” and “Wicked Cultured.”

“A key difference that separates the Magnificent Bastard from other character tropes…is the Bastard's willingness to step onto the playing field in person. The risks are obvious, but the strategic advantages are numerous.

“While usually an antagonist, the Magnificent Bastard can be aligned on either side of a conflict. Hell, he's so amazing he tends to forgo the idea of good and evil all together, instead following his own agenda, choosing to help whichever side will further his goals. However, it's true that his penchant for manipulation at the expense of others means it's common for him to be a Villain, Villain Protagonist, or at least an Anti-Hero.” In this case, his quest to prove his innocence in the murder of his fiancée becomes a mission for bloody (let’s emphasize that word again: bloody) vengeance. As he would point out: “Does the nation weep for the death of a fallen soldier? Yes, certainly. But not the way a mother weeps for the death of her child, nor the way a husband mourns the loss of his wife. These were not murders I have committed, not boys I have slain; these were acts of war.”

Lauded as a gentleman in popular society – on the surface, he’s handsome, charming, and possessing of a sharp wit – but feared and hated by those who have heard and believe the rumours.
If you believe his own stories, he is Chaos incarnate, the Egyptian God Seth and the brother to the Three Fates of Greek Mythology, all wrapped up in one. If you believe the rumours, he’s a villain, a sadist, a criminal, an opium addict, an absinthe enthusiast, a murderer (his bribes, they say, have bought him immunity amongst the corrupt police force), an Irishman, and a vampire. The truth: Parson is a mere man; still, his intellect, influence, affluence, and temperament all serve to disprove any sense of ordinariness.

His attire is dark, which does nothing to disprove the rumour of vampirism: black, pin-striped pants, a white long-sleeved shirt, black vest and long overcoat. A gold chain on his vest leads to an old pocket watch, which sticks out of his pocket. In his brown leather gloves he holds a long black walking stick with a glass pommel. A moth is entrapped in the dome of glass like a fly in amber.

Besides Sherlock Holmes, Parson Sinews is inspired by Oscar Wilde’s famous Dorian Gray and Lord Henry Wotton, and also by Edward Moon (from Jonathan Barnes’ The Somnambulist).

He is also a capable fighter and marksman, having studied the Canne de Combat fighting style and possessing a sizeable collection of firearms.

It should also be noted that Parson Sinews is more or less invulnerable to pain; in fact, following the death of Rachelle, he has rather come to enjoy the sensation (“Pleasure and pain are indistinguishable at the best of times. Even at the worst of times it would be difficult to choose a favourite.”)
	Internal Conflicts:	

While Parson may seem to be cold and unfeeling, harsh and condemning, if not outright evil, these traits are the defencive walls he’s built up for himself to keep his demons at bay. In truth, he has a passionate (yet grievously wounded) heart. The death of his love has left him not merely broken but utterly destroyed.
	External Conflicts:	 

Parson’s desires nothing more than to put aside his grief. Without the fires of vengeance burning in his mind, the torments of his loss would devour his soul from the inside out. With that in mind, his intent to find and destroy Rachelle’s murderer becomes a desperate and bloody quest.

            <Synopsis>Henry Charles and Marianne rendezvous with the Penny Dreadful crew.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The Penny Dreadful should already have arrived at the clock tower, but Henry Charles Ocelot and Mrs. Hatton had no other plan but to continue waiting. Any number of things could have caused the delay. They’d barely made their rendezvous on time themselves. Since leaving Trafalgar Square, they’d come across hundreds of zombies and had had to make the journey on foot, making use of a number of unscheduled detours. The airship crew had the advantage of navigating the sky, but that was assuming they’d made it back to the airship after completing their mission.
The zombies were everywhere, wandering like ghosts through the shadows. The inhuman sound of distant, hungry moaning had become a soundscape as constant as the striations of crickets in a cornfield, each voice blending with another. The sound was punctuated only by the occasional screams of the living as they either ran for cover or were eaten alive.
The sound reverberated along the cobblestones, while Henry Charles and Marianne found a quiet corner to catch their breath and wait. They were largely ignored by the zombies, which were distracted by the sounds of distant screams or the scent of freshly spilled blood. So long as they remained perfectly still, even as the occasional zombie stumbled towards them, they encountered little trouble. Still, every time one of those creatures even looked in their direction, their hearts would begin to race and Mrs. Hatton’s arm would begin to tremble.
“How much longer do we wait?” asked Mrs. Hatton when the coast was clear.
By answer, Henry Charles pointed up at the sky. The Penny Dreadful had floated into view.
“Just until it touches down, I suppose,” he said.
Mrs. Hatton let out a yip of joy.
“I never thought they’d make it,” she said with a triumphant laugh.
“Honestly,” said Henry Charles, “Neither did I.”
They waited, not entirely calmly, as the dirigible descended. The zombies continued to meander in the near distance, and sometimes they got a bit too close for comfort. The dirigible made its way down slowly, coming in right beside Big Ben, its propellers whirring, its sails retracted. The zombies paid no attention to it, setting their sights instead on earthbound things.
When the ship was close enough to the ground, they could make out Captain Merrick standing at the prow. The crew emerged beside him and looked down into the sea of fog.
Henry Charles and Mrs. Hatton emerged from their little alcove and waved, not daring to call out for fear of drawing unwanted attention. They waved with both arms, taking care to watch their surroundings and not just the ship above.
From within the fog, a figure emerged. From this distance, it was impossible to know if he was alive or a zombie. Henry Charles preferred not to wait around to find out. He glanced up.
“They see us,” Mrs. Hatton whispered.
He nodded, hopefully not belying how nervous he felt. He wasn’t sure if Mrs. Hatton had seen the figure in the distance. He drew closer; it was a living man, judging by his gait. The closer he got, the more his features revealed themselves. The mask upon his head, bird-like and dark, that of a plague doctor. A murder of crows glided above his head, their wings spread. They flew unnaturally close to one another, like a bunch of helium balloons. Likely, they were not birds at all, but machines, built of brass and wood, painted black and decorated with feathers and glass eyes. There were strings attached to each of their ankles, and the Resurrectionist pulled the strings, dragging the birds along like kites. Every now and then one of them would emit a hiss of green air that would trail behind it, dispersing into the fog.
“You’ll ’ave ter climb up, guv. Ma’am,” Kippar Lockwood shouted, tipping his hat to the pair, “Beggin’ your forgiveness, but it ain’t safe ter land.”
The crew had let down a rope ladder. It dangled just above, beyond Mrs. Hatton’s reach.
“Come, you’ll have to go first,” he said, keeping a wary eye on the figure in the fog. He bent on one knee, allowing Mrs. Hatton to step up onto his leg, and boosted her up so she could reach the ladder. He watched as she began to ascend. He returned his attention to the Resurrectionist, but the man was gone. Vanished into the fog.
He reached for the rope.</Text>

            <Title>The Etiquette of The Ball</Title>
            <Text>The entertainment you intend giving is larger than a dinner party. To it you will invite a greater number of your friends and associates, so great a number, indeed, of young and middle-aged people, that the serious question is, how will they be entertained? You conclude that you will allow them to dance, and you will name your entertainment a ball.
Each dancer should be provided with a ball-card bearing a printed programme of the dances, having a space for making engagements upon the same, with a small pencil attached.
Etiquette requires that the lady dance first with her escort, and afterward he should see that she is provided with partners, and that she enjoys herself, though she may dance with whom she pleases. He should conduct her to supper, and will hold himself in readiness to escort her home whenever she desires to go.
No gentleman whose clothing or breath is tainted with the fumes of strong drink or tobacco should ever enter the presence of ladies in the dancing room.
No gentleman should play the clown in the ballroom. Dancing a breakdown, making unusual noise, dressing in a peculiar style, swinging the arms about, swaggering, etc. are simply the characteristics of the buffoon.
A gentleman who goes to a ball should dance frequently; if he does not, he will not receive many invitations afterward; he is not invited to ornament the wall and “wait for supper.”
Ladies should not be allowed to sit the evening through without the privilege of dancing. Gentlemen should be sufficiently watchful to see that all ladies present are provided with partners.

The Evils of the Ball

For the company to assemble at a late hour and engage in unusual, exciting, and severe exercise throughout the entire night is often too great a tax upon the physical system. To dress too thinly, and in a state of perspiration to be exposed, as ladies at the ball frequently are, to drafts of cold, is often times to plant the seeds of a disease from which they never recover.
Again, to come in contact, as ladies are liable to do, more especially at the public ball, with disreputable men, is sometimes to form alliances that will cause a lifetime of sorrow.
Well may the watchful parent look with anxiety and suspicion upon the ball, because its associations are so frequently dangerous. If in this chapter we give admonitions and suggestions that shall tend to correct some of the evils of the dance, our labours will not be in vain.

The orchestra will first play a march, then a quadrille, a waltz, a polka, a gallop, etc. Interspersed with several round dances to each quadrille, usually ending with a march prior to supper.
Never eat your supper in gloves. White kid gloves should be worn at other times throughout the dancing. It is well to have two pairs, one before supper, and one afterward.
If any lady is without an attendant, it should be the duty of the lady of the house to see that she is provided with an escort. After supper, several dances will follow, the company dispersing, let us hope, at an early, temperate hour.
The lady is not obliged to invite her escort to enter the house when he accompanies her home, and if invited he should decline the invitation. He should request permission to call the next day or evening, which will be true politeness.
A gentleman should never presume upon the acquaintance of a lady after a ball. Ballroom introductions close with the dancing. Ladies will consult their own pleasure about recognizing a ballroom acquaintance at a future meeting.

Behaviour to be Avoided at the Ball

	•	A lady should not enter or cross the hall unattended.
	•	No gentleman should ever enter the ladies’ dressing room at a ball.
	•	Never lead a lady in the ball by the hand; always offer the arm.
	•	A lady should not select a gentleman to hold her bouquet, fan, and gloves during the dance, unless he be her husband, escort, or a relative.
	•	Do not engage yourself for the last two or three dances; it may keep you too late.
	•	Neither married nor unmarried ladies should leave a ballroom unattended.
	•	A gentleman in waltzing should not encircle the waist of a lady until the dancing commences, and he should drop his arm when the music ceases.
	•	No gentleman should use his bare hand to press the waist of a lady in the waltz. If without gloves, he should carry a handkerchief in his hand.

How to Entertain At The Party

Should any lady-guest be invited to play the piano, it is courtesy for the gentleman nearest to her to offer his arm and escort her to the instrument. While she is playing he will hold her bouquet, fan, and gloves. He should also turn the leaves if he can readily read music, but he should not attempt it otherwise. If is very impolite to speak disparagingly of the piano, however much it may be out of tune.
Among the methods of entertainment resorted to, aside from conversation and dancing, may be those of a literary character. Thus, a debatable question may be compounded, a presiding officer selected, assisted by two, four, or six others, two leading disputants appointed, debaters chosen upon each side, and the speakers given each two, three, or five minutes to talk; the president and board of arbitration to decide the question according to the weight of the argument.
Croquet parties are very fashionable, and are a healthy, pleasant means of diversion. The essentials necessary to make the game pleasant are good grounds that can be shaded, and clean, and comfortable, cool seats.
It is the duty of the gentlemen to be ever attentive to the ladies. If it be a picnic, the gentlemen will carry the luncheon, erect the swings, construct the tables, bring the water, and provide the fuel for boiling the tea.
On fishing excursions, they will furnish the tackle, bait the hooks, row the boats, carry the fish, and furnish comfortable seats for the ladies. In gathering nuts, they will climb the trees, do the shaking, carry the nuts, and assist the ladies across the streets and over the fences.</Text>

Ebook revolution
Print on demand
	CreateSpace
EBM (Espresso Book Machines)

Traditionally:
You would query a publishing company (one company at a time because simultaneous submissions was not generally acceptable) or attempt to find an agent (better chance of being published if you had an agent)
Until about 2007, self-publishing meant shooting yourself in the foot (why would you self publish? Is your work so bad you couldn’t get anyone to publish it for you?).
Now, this is no longer the case
Around 2008, ebooks really started to take off, as Amazong made a big push- essentially cut out Barnes and Noble, Borders, etc. (Now you can buy books without needing to put pants on)

Kickstarter:
Essentially, going straight to the reader

EBM
- A form of Print on Demand technology (a robot that prints your books in minutes)
- You can print any book on the “network”
- Bore Print on Demand, you would have to go to a printer and have your work printed, you’d have to store your books, etc. (Expensive)

Amazon
- Ebooks
- Print on Demand

Traditionally publishing is slow—can’t keep up with the reader base—whereas digital publishing, ebooks, etc, allows for writers to quickly write and publish ideas in a way that keeps up with trends
There is a misconception that if you get published traditionally it makes you a “real” writer
- What does it mean to be published? Getting your work into the hands of your readers

Self-publishing—how do you know that your work is up to par, highly polished, etc.
- Writing groups
- Hire an editor

Marketing

	You can’t just spam facebook &amp; twitter
	Go to conventions
- Fair price point
	Offer free ebooks for a limited time—creates fan base, fans may feel inclined to buy your other books

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>Miss Monday awoke after a relatively sleepless night in her apartment. She'd spent most of the night lying restlessly in bed, occasionally shifting slightly, fluffing her pillow, or scratching a persistent itch on the back of her neck. Eventually, accepting that she was not likely to catch more than a brief wink of sleep, she'd sat up, lit a candle, and flipped through the pages of an old book she'd read a few dozen times already.
A Guide to the Manners, Etiquette, and Deportment of the Most Refined Society. Miss Monday was by no means an aristocrat. She had money, but wealth alone does not an aristocrat make.
She’d only recently learned to read, for instance, having hired a tutor who had until her position working for Miss Monday been working with the children of lords and ladies and as a result, treated Miss Monday like a small child. Once she’d made sufficient progress that she could continue her studies on her own, she dismissed the tutor.
Miss Monday was not an aristocrat. She could now read passably well, and she could speak convincingly enough, like a real lady, although when she drank she tended to slip back into the clumsy and uneducated speech of the common Londoner.
She still used words that were unbecoming for a lady, which meant that when she was dressed up in all her finery, she was often mistaken for a prostitute; how else would such a poor and uneducated lady have the funds necessary to purchase such fine clothes? But better to be mistaken for a prostitute than recognised as a thief. She would always manage to turn the situtation to her favour. She was resourceful like that. But she could stand to improve her understanding of proper behaviour for a lady, in order to better fit in to aristocratic society.
Her shelves were lined with guidebooks for young ladies which defined the proper etiquette for various social situations. Table manners, conversation, how to speak when in the company of gentlemen, and so on. She’d read them until the pages were frail and dog-eared.
Suddenly, she'd snapped the pages shut, and blown out the candle, and settled back into her bed.
It was Connor that had disturbed her sleep.
It was his face she’d seen, leering at her with dead eyes, not Mr. O's. It was the memory of his cold hands that she had felt on the nape of her neck. It was the stench of his breath. It was the sound of his breath through his decayed lungs.
That was what had kept her awake that night.
She heard a knock on her door first thing in the morning and felt a knot tighten in her stomach. Hastily, she dressed herself, ran a comb through her knotted hair, and pulled on a pair of silk gloves.
Another knock resounded from the door. As she turned to open the door of her bedroom, she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror that managed to shock her. She gasped. How could she have forgotten?
On her nightstand, she retrieved a contraption of brass with leather straps. Facing herself in the mirror, she thrust one of the brass parts into the socket of her eye. There was a clicking sound as the contraption latched itself into a matching piece that had been surgically implanted in her eye. The knock on the door came again, as she quickly put the straps in place.
She hurried to the door, and undid the latch. Somehow, she half expected to see Lord Connor's face, grinning at her, when she opened the door.
She did not expect to see Mr. O. Somehow, she managed to keep the surprise out of her face as she looked up at him.
To his credit, he also managed to remain composed as he looked at her without allowing his eyes to wander to the strange ocular device she used instead of a right eye.
Ever the paragon of politeness, "Please forgive me for calling without prior invitation, especially at such an early hour," he said, "But I am led to believe that this is the current address of a gentleman who I had the great pleasure of meeting last night at the Connor Manor."
Miss Monday was not entirely sure how to proceed. Could she yet hope to rid herself of this gentleman, persistant though he was, by convincing him that he was at the wrong address?
"I'm looking for Mr. Monday," he explained.
"I'm sorry, sir," she said.
"Monday is likely a pseudonym," he interrupted, "You may know him by another name, although I have been unable to ascertain his true identity."
He produced a sketch from the pocket of his coat, and having shown it to her, awaited her reply.
"This is a man in a mask," she said.
"Yes," Mr. O agreed.
"How can I possibly recognize a picture of a man in a mask?"
“Well,” he said. “It has the most unusual feature. See here, the right eye? Most unusual indeed.”
Miss Monday grimaced.
“At first I thought it was part of the mask. It was only later, when the gentleman tried on a different mask,” he continued, pausing to produce the stag’s head mask. “That it occurred to me. It wasn’t part of the mask at all; it was a prosthetic eye. Do you, by any chance, know of any gentleman at this address, with a prosthetic eye?”
She rolled her eyes. There was a whir of gears from her right, as the ocular device rotated.
"You knew," she said, more annoyed than angry. "You knew all along."
"Knew what?" he said, his face the picture of ironic ignorance. He could hardly help grinning at her.
"How did you find me?" she demanded.
"I have my ways," he said, which was not much of an explanation.
She pushed the door open wider, and gestured for him to come inside. He hesitated as if to say, 'are you sure?' She tapped her foot impatiently.
"How do you take your tea," she said through gritted teeth, "Mr. O?"
She said the name as if it were an insult.
"Ah," he said, "Such a gracious host. Lemon, if you have it. Cream, if you don’t.”
He took a seat on her chaise longue, without waiting to be invited to do so. Since he was obviously fully capable of politeness when he was so inclined, the slight was obviously deliberate. Well, if he was trying to rile her up, she decided, she could play that game as well.
She set about heating the tea and slicing the lemons, while her unexpected guest seemed content to examine her modest apartment from the comfort of the chaise longue.
As Miss Monday had been involved in numerous heists, claiming supposedly priceless artwork and artefacts from museums, and selling them to the highest bidder, she could have been living in a much less modest apartment, in a much less bourgeois neighbourhood. She could have been living in a mansion, really.
And yet, she did not wish the unwanted attention that might be drawn by living within her not inconsiderable means. She did not want anyone starting to wonder about the source of her income, especially not the police. So most of her money, she gave away, anonymously, to the poor. In a way, it was almost poetic. She’d grown up poor, and now she was giving back to them.
She casually wondered if this was the reason her unwanted guest had tracked her down, to extort money from her. She considered putting something a bit stronger than lemon in the tea, but she thought it might be worth hearing him out first. Still, she found his presence irksome, so she squeezed considerably more lemon into his tea than could possibly be considered pleasant.
She returned from the kitchen with a cup of tea for him, and a cup for herself. She took a seat next to him and settled in to the chair.
“So, what did you do with the body?” she asked, and took a sip of tea. “Did you use the airship after all?”
“No,” he said, shrugging. “I left him at the house. Stuck him in a closet. They’ll find him eventually, but it’s not as if anyone will suspect our involvement in his death.”
She smiled pleasantly as his face puckered when he sipped his own.
"How's the tea?" she asked innocently.
"It's fine," he managed to say.</Text>

            <Title>Annabel Grey</Title>
            <Text>Miss Monday, née Annabel Gray

Role in Story:		Protagonist
Occupation:		Thief
 	

Physical Description:	Viewed from the right angle, Miss Monday was stunning. With long ringlets of orange hair, a fair complexion and perfectly delicate features, that coy smile upon her lips was still her most captivating feature. She was smartly dressed in the height of fashion, with a cameo necklace and pearl earrings, a long skirt with a short bustle, in a rich green to match her one remaining eye and her silk gloves. She wore a corsage as if to give the impression that she had an escort with her, absent at the moment though he might be.  From any other angle (and in any other mood), Miss Monday could be utterly terrifying. She boasted a long scar on that side of her face that was covered by the unusual contraption which covered her missing eye. She had the capacity to scowl in a way that was most dreadful, and there was an intensity in her remaining eye that could send chills up the spine of even the bravest of men.   She carries a Derringer and a Colt, and wears gloves and layers of silk skirts to hide her pistols and her mechanical arm.  Like the clockwork eye she straps to her face each morning, her arm is made of mechanical parts. Gears which click as she rotates her forearm, hydraulics which hiss as she flexes her artificial muscles. Each joint bears a keyhole. The key she wears like a pendant around her neck is used for winding up her arm like a music box. The arm is copper and brass and made with the same extraordinary workmanship of her mechanical eye. It moves with quiet motions, even as the gears whir and click.

Personality:		Miss Monday tends to be highly sarcastic. She’s more or less fearless, as well as intelligent and resourceful. She cannot stand to be shown up, especially by men, and is constantly striving to prove her capableness. She is prone to air sickness, but is afraid of the unliving more than anything—so afraid, in fact, that she has trouble accepting that they’re real. She is ashamed of her disfigurements, and takes pains to hide them or make them less noticeable. She has trouble believing that anyone could love her, although she’s not afraid to use her feminine wiles to her advantage.  She’s decisive, quick on her feet, and quickly able to grasp information. Her background has taught her to look out only for herself, to trust no one, and to take what she likes and give nothing back. Despite that, deep down she has a good heart.
Habits/Mannerisms:	Miss Monday dresses smart and tends to follow the general rules of politeness, although her manners can at times be a bit rough. She’s also much too assertive (especially for a woman). She has a crass vocabulary and an unusual way with words, as well as a strange sense of humour.

Background:		Miss Monday, née Annabel Gray, was orphaned at an early age, and remembers very little of her parents. She learned to take care of herself, scrapping with the boys, stealing her meals, and eventually being adopted by Jack Bernhardt, who helped her to take her profession to the next level, not to steal for survival. He also helped her to form professional contacts, arranged to have her taught to use firearms, bartitsu, and manners. She was involved in several high-profile heists. She was also occasionally hired as an assassin.

Internal Conflicts:		Miss Monday isn’t exactly haunted by her criminal past, but she’s not proud of it either. She’s killed people and not all of them deserve it. She would like to redeem herself, although she wonders if that desire might be self-destructive; wouldn’t it be in her best interest if she just let the world burn? In other words, she’s softer than she would care to admit.

External Conflicts:		Miss Monday, a hardened assassin, must battle the unliving alongside Mr. O. Together, they also fight the nefarious Resurrection Man, a man from Miss Monday’s past.

Notes:		Monday is a relatively simple pseudonym. She was born on a Monday.  Miss Monday is a formidable sharpshooter. Whatever machinations had gone into the design of her prosthetic eye, it is more enhancement than replacement.</Text>

            <Title>Scene Two</Title>
            <Synopsis>Roderick talks with Dr. Allen.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Roderick hated not having all the pieces of a puzzle. It made it difficult, if not impossible, to solve. So it was with hardly any concern for any possible danger he might be in, that he sat down for tea with the notorious leader of the Resurrectionists, a known murderer who had easily evaded Scotland Yard when the murders were linked to him.
“Biscuit?” offered the murderer.
“Thank you,” said Roderick, who had an affinity for sweets.
He added a ridiculously heaping spoonful of sugar to his tea, then reached back into the jar to reload the spoon.
The doctor scrutinized him. Bare feet upon the ottoman, dandyish in all other regards, he exuded an air of calm composure. It seemed the doctor was trying to determine if it was affected or not. He took another spoonful of sugar for good measure. At last, he took a sip, not taking his eyes off the doctor, whose eyes widened as he watched Roderick’s tea ritual.
“Tea with your sugar?”
“Are you really a doctor?” Roderick blurted out.
Allen smiled.
“I am,” he said.
“So, where does that name come from? Some little known penny blood?”
“You’re very clever, Mr. Steen,” the doctor replied, coughing into a handkerchief, then reaching out for his cup of tea. “Resurrectionists do take the names of penny blood characters, but my name is not a pseudonym. Allen is my family name. But that’s not what you really want to ask, is it? You want to know about the experiments. How I took people apart and put them back together again, like a tinkerer with an old clock. That’s what you want to ask, isn’t it?”
“I have many questions,” Roderick replied, “But sure, let’s start with the murders.”
“Murder is a bit of a dysphemism, don’t you think? I never wanted to kill anybody. I was hired by the military to conduct research on genetics. When my experiments failed—”
“Experiments for what purpose?” Roderick interjected.
The doctor gave a shrug.
“Various. I was to come up with a way of improving our soldiers’ chances in military affairs. I thought of a number of ways of accomplishing this, many of which were immediately dismissed. I could make soldiers who could light fires using only the capacity of their brains, but the subjects continued to burn themselves. I made shapeshifters, people who could shift from one shape into another, from human to animal. Some could even change their faces at will, become another person, so to speak. But the shift was incredibly painful, so the idea was dismissed.”
“You mentioned genetics,” Roderick said. He was intrigued, but this was a word he’d not heard before, and he read enough scientific journals to be current.
The doctor continued without really addressing the question.
“I used a number of Darwin’s theories as a starting point and worked from there. But it wasn’t until I reunited with Jack that my work really began to take off. Jack was my muse, my inspiration. His own ideas pushed mine to greater heights. He was obsessed with the idea of immortality, of curing death.”
“It was his research that led me to begin using mechanical parts in my experiments. If I could build a clockwork heart that could work just as well as an organic one, we wouldn’t have to worry about heart failure. Or if I could build a mechanical eye, we wouldn’t have to worry about blindness. You see? The possibilities this suggested, they were endless. For once, the military fully supported it. But Jack’s experiments were radical, and they required human subjects. The military approved. I did not.”
“But you conducted them anyway,” Roderick countered.
“I was given a drug, a serum of Jack’s design, which was designed to render me compliant. Instead, it caused psychosis.”
“So that’s when you began taking people apart,” Roderick summarized. He took a sip of his tea, but it was too sweet. He frowned. “You’re a very disturbing man,” he said bluntly. “Clever, I think, but disturbing. Tell me more about Jack. Who is he to you?”
Here, the doctor’s tone shifted. It was less defensive, more nostalgic.
“Jack Bernhardt. You might know him as Anthony Tidkins. But to me, he’s just Jack. My son. My brilliant, brilliant son. I taught him everything I know, but he surpassed me, easily, particularly in his knowledge of mechanical engineering. He was the founder of the Resurrectionists, a true visionary. At the time, his experiments were radical, but not entirely dangerous. It was only when he learned that I was dying that he began to take things too far.”
“Ha!” Roderick exclaimed, taking another biscuit from the tray. A pile of crumbs lay at his feet. Roderick truly loved his biscuits. “By your standards, that really is saying something.”
“Fearing that the other Resurrectionists would refuse to conduct his experiments, as I had, he used the serum to ensure their compliance, although its results were unpredictable. With some of London’s greatest scientists under his thumb, they abandoned their own research in favour of pursuing the Dead London Project. The victims—for lack of a better term—of Jack’s serum, obeyed his every whim. The Resurrectionists were no longer a scientific society. They were a cult.”
“Alright, that is going a bit far,” Roderick admitted.
“Thus began his experiments with Lazarus.”
“Beg your pardon? Lazarus?”
“You haven’t seen them, then? The zombies?”
A light went off inside Roderick’s head. Zombies. He was talking about the disease that had infected Lord Connor before his untimely demise, and which had plagued the ladies and gentlemen at his party, who had risen from the apparent dead. The men in the alley.
“So they’re not vampires?”
The doctor coughed. He reached for his oxygen mask and took a big puff of air. He mulled over the term.
“Vampires? I suppose it’s as good a term as any, but lately I’ve taken to calling these creatures zombies. Whatever you want to call them, they are the resurrected dead.”
“What sort of experiments were they conducting? What is Lazarus?”
“Lazarus is the name of the virus,” the doctor explained. “Jack believes that Lazarus is the key in his quest for immortality. He believed that he could cure the virus, but he needed to find test subjects who were resistant to the virus. And for that, he needed a large body of test subjects and a means of distribution. As for the latter, it was Lord Connor that came up with a solution. Unfortunately, Connor had a change of heart, so it had to be taken by force; a thief was hired for that purpose, and Connor was dealt with. And for the former, the population of London was large enough to provide the test subjects.”
“The population of London!” Roderick exclaimed.
“The Dead London Project,” Dr. Allen reminded him with a bit of a cough.
“Lovely. Doctor, thank you for the tea, but there’s no time to sit around while this experiment is allowed to continue. Will you help me to stop it, or do you intend to stand in my way?”
“Mr. Steen, much as I’d love to help you, I’m afraid it’s too late. Lazarus is already spreading. I was just about to make my escape when you showed up. It’s not safe here. We need to get out of the city.”
Roderick straightened his collar and stood up. He brushed the crumbs off his legs and ran a finger through his hair like a comb.
“Right then. How do we get out of here?” he said, remarkably calm.
“Follow me,” Allen replied.
He beckoned to his servant, and sent the man to fetch a mask for Roderick.
“Gas mask,” he explained, “Should keep you safe from Lazarus for a few hours. There’s an ornithopter in the Cappa Laboratory, which we’ll use to get out of London.”
Roderick nodded. He’d play along, for now. He had little other choice. But when we get out of London, I’ll have you arrested.
“I’ll need to make a couple stops along the way, if that’s alright. Do you have any more of these masks?”</Text>

            <Title>Scene Four</Title>
            <Text>When the cab pulled up to the Agency’s driveway, Mr. O and Miss Monday were both covered and blood and smelled of rot. Clumps of dead flesh clung to Miss Monday’s clothes like burs. Mr. O’s hair was dishevelled and wet with blood.
He put a coin in the driver’s hand, and opened the door for Miss Monday. He held out a hand and helped her descend from the cab. Her dress was torn in so many places it could have caused a scandal.
Mr. O led the way to the front door of the tall, brick building, and Miss Monday followed behind. Mr. O carried the duffel bag over his shoulder. He opened the door, which chimed pleasantly, and held it open.
Miss Monday stepped inside and was once again overwhelmed by the cacophony of sound.
The loud mechanical sounds of the printing press filled the room, as they often did. The clacking of typewriters and the bustle of the office workers served to indicate that everything was operating as usual, at least here on the first floor, where they printed magazines and newspapers.
Mrs. Fields manned the front desk, but she was joined by an older woman, who stood beside her. She had the look of someone with more money than friends. She was dressed expensively but not fashionably. She wore a dress in bright purple, with a broad and frilly hat in matching colour, the hat being decorated with the plumage of some unfortunate bird. There was a frown of disapproval etched on her face.
Mr. O returned her frown. He removed his top hat in a show of politeness, and bowed slightly. “Mother,” he said, “Allow me to introduce you to Miss Monday.”
Miss Monday curtseyed and gave an awkward smile.
“The new recruit?” asked Mrs. Grimmer. “I’ve heard of you,” she said. “I hope you’re as good at your work as my son claims.”
“This is Mrs. Grimmer,” said Mr. O, to Miss Monday, saving her from having to reply.
“I need you to come with me, right away,” she said, turning her attention from Miss Monday.
“Certainly, mother,” Mr. O replied, “After I’ve had a warm bath, a bottle of wine, and a nap, I’ll follow you straightaway.”
Mrs. Grimmer frowned. “Is that an attempt at humour?” she asked, “I’m afraid I’m unamused.”
“When have you ever been amused by anything? But no, I wasn’t trying to be funny. We’ve only just returned from Miss Monday’s first excursion, a rather trying mission if I may say so, and I’d like to remove the blood from my hair and clothes, if that’s quite alright with you. And more than that, I’d like a good, stiff drink in my hand and a comfortable chair beneath my arse.”
“Language,” his mother scolded. “And you think you’ve had a hard day?” she added. “Well, you’re hardly the only one. I’ll need to speak with you in your office. One hour.”
She pivoted on her heels, and disappeared down the hallway, leaving the dishevelled duo perplexed and annoyed.
“What does she want to talk to you about?” Miss Monday wondered aloud.
“Budget, I imagine,” he grumbled. “The Agency’s budget is under review,” he added darkly. “Penny dreadfuls and newspapers are not exactly enough to cover the Agency’s expenses. We’re partly subsidized by the Grimmer family fortune. Mother has been discussing cutting us off, while the monarchy has been debating over the idea of taking us over. I suspect a decision has been made.”
Miss Monday blinked in surprise, but he didn’t give her the chance to pursue further inquiry. He abruptly turned his attention to his receptionist, who had been doing her best not to stare at his clothes, or wrinkle her nose while he’d been standing there, talking with Mrs. Grimmer and Miss Monday.
“Good afternoon, Mrs. Fields,” said Mr. O.
“Good afternoon, Mr. O. Miss Monday.”
Miss Monday returned the greeting with a smile.
“If you’re wondering about our appearance,” said Mr. O, “Allow me to explain. It’s all part of a new marketing scheme.”
“Ah,” said the receptionist, nodding enthusiastically at the notion, “So, you’re attempting to drum up interest for a new penny dreadful, then?”
“Yes, precisely,” Mr. O explained, “I realise it’s unconventional, but it gets people talking.”
“I would certainly imagine it does,” she said.
On that note, he excused himself, and headed down the hall with Miss Monday following in his wake.
“Oh, why don’t you just tell that poor lady the truth?” Miss Monday scolded.
“About what?”
“The Agency. You do realise she’s probably figured it out for herself anyhow, don’t you? Well, not all of it, anyway, but I’m quite certain she isn’t fool enough to believe you’re covered in blood because you’re promoting books. Probably thinks you’re Jack The Ripper. That’s probably why she’s so afraid of you.”
“Jack The Ripper,” Mr. O laughed.
Miss Monday looked scandalized. She hadn’t thought even Mr. O would laugh about Jack The Ripper.
“He isn’t real,” Mr. O explained. “One of our writers thought him up.”
Miss Monday blinked in confusion. “What do you mean?”
“Those women, whose guts were ripped out. It wasn’t the work of a murderer. It was the unliving. Of course, we couldn’t let that little fact get out, could we? So we called in one of our writers; some of them are aware of what we do here, you understand. And what he came up with was Anthony.”
“Explains why they haven’t caught him yet,” she muttered as they continued down the hallway.
They unlocked the door to Mr. O’s upper office, and when they were certain that no one was looking, they pulled the lever to summon the secret elevator.
Even the mechanical clang of the printing press in the room next door was not enough to drown out the clamour of the elevator moving up from the basement.
“So, you really think Mrs. Fields is afraid of me?” he asked.
“Without a doubt,” she replied.
The elevator arrived, and he slid open the rusty gate. They stepped inside and began their descent into the Agency proper.
“Well,” said Mr. O, “She ought to be. I’m a dangerous man.”
Miss Monday snorted. “You wish,” she said.</Text>

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>It took a few moments, despite the familiarity of his surroundings, for Jonathan to figure out where the hell he was. It was an experience he was familiar with, waking up in his own bed with no recollection of how he’d gotten there, but on this particular occasion there was no smell of alcohol on his breath. He certainly had the headache and foggy memory he associated with a hangover, but he also had a stinging sensation in his neck, and a niggling sensation that his life was in danger.
As the fog cleared from his mind, he remembered everything with a jolt that sent him practically jumping out of bed. He was a fugitive from the police and his own mother was harbouring a literally underground criminal organization whose nefarious activities included bringing the dead back to life. He suddenly wished it was just a hangover.
Upon getting out of bed, Jonathan found that he’d been dragged into bed practically naked, as he was wearing only trousers and an undershirt. He thought to summon his butler, but thought better of it. He would simply have to manage to dress himself. Then he would make his escape. He wondered if his own home was now guarded by Resurrectionists, but he pushed aside the thought.
He made his way to the wardrobe and managed without too much difficulty to put on his own clothes, though he was forced to forgo the luxury of cufflinks and his cravat was tied somewhat messily. Still, looking in the mirror, he was pleased enough with the result, and he half wondered why anyone bothered with manservants at all.
The lingering fatigue of the dart’s toxins continued to slow both his movements and his thoughts, but he was conscious enough to look for a weapon of some sort. His handgun wasn’t where he would normally have kept it, but he did find his old jack knife on his nightstand. He stuck this into his waistcoat pocket.
He turned to the window. If only he had his airship parked outside again. His bedroom was on the upper story of the Grimmer household, and it was a long way down.
So, his egress would have to be found elsewhere. He turned to the bedroom door. What awaited on the other side, he couldn’t guess. A dozen Resurrectionists? His mother? Or merely his butler? He hated to take his chances, but he creaked open the door and peered into the hall. To his profound relief, the hallway was empty.
He crept into the hall, the wooden floorboards groaning in protest beneath every footstep. He cursed the old house silently as another wave of fatigue rushed over him, and he had to lean against the wall for support. What the hell had that dart been laced with? The nausea passed, and he continued to tiptoe loudly down the hall, cringing with every creaking floorboard.
The stairs protested with even greater volume as he crept downstairs. Sod it all, he thought, and broke into a run. If they hadn’t heard him by now, they must have been deaf. He tore down the spiral staircase until he reached the main floor and found himself face to face with his butler.
“Mr. Grimmer,” he said.
Manfred McCall had been the Grimmer family butler for as long as Jonathan could remember. He had one of those ageless faces, insofar as he had always appeared old and continued to do so. His fair red hair had been prematurely white, his face clean-shaven and lined with wrinkles, since Jonathan was a young boy. He was Irish, but otherwise unflappably respectable.
“Are you with them?” Jonathan demanded.
“With whom?”
“The Resurrectionists, of course,” said Jonathan. “My mother.”
“Ah,” said the butler.
Jonathan drew his knife.
“Out of my way, Manfred,” he warned.
The butler put his hands up cautiously.
“Mr. Grimmer, please calm yourself. You don’t understand,” he protested. “If you would just listen, for a moment, Mrs. Grimmer has instructed me to explain everything.”
“She betrayed me, Manfred!” Jonathan argued. “My own mother!”
The butler let out a weary sigh.
“Look, can you please just put the knife down first? Sir? I promised I would explain, and I will, but I would prefer to do so without being at knifepoint.”
Jonathan shook his head. “I will do no such thing. You will simply have to put up with it or allow me to leave.”
“Very well,” said the butler, resigned to conversing at knifepoint.
“Your mother didn’t betray you,” he began. “She remains loyal to your father’s cause.”
“Is that why she poisoned me?” Jonathan demanded, brandishing the knife wildly.
“Yes,” Manfred told him, simply. “She couldn’t let you in on the truth without blowing her cover. She poisoned you, yes. An unfortunate necessity, but the poison was not deadly. Mr. Grimmer, your mother has been seeking a way to dismantle the Resurrectionists from the inside. They believe she is loyal to their cause. It would have ruined everything she had worked for if her cover had been blown. The Resurrectionists are too dangerous to confront directly. She saw espionage as the best opportunity to disrupt their operations.”
Jonathan laughed.
“A fine job she’s doing of it,” he said. “She has allowed them to operate right under her nose, given them access to my father’s secret facilities and research laboratories, all so that, what, she could monitor their activities and do nothing to stop them? You do realise they recently infected hundreds with the Lazarus Virus, don’t you?”
His butler shrugged heavily. Evidently this was not going as well as he’d hoped. Well, Jonathan was a journalist; he sought truth and exposed lies and hypocrisy. He would not be so easily duped.
“Things have gotten out of control.”
“Oh, do you think so?” he said sarcastically.
This conversation was taking too long. He looked around cautiously. Perhaps he was just being paranoid, but he still expected other Resurrectionists to show up at any time. He wanted to wrap this up and get out of here, but there was a part of him that wanted to hear what Manfred had to say.
“There was nothing she could have done to stop them. You’ve seen for yourself how dangerous these people are, and she has precious few allies. She needs your help, Mr. Grimmer.”
“Oh, that’s rich!” Jonathan scoffed. “Shoots me with a poisoned dart and hauls me off unconscious—without a word of explanation, mind you—and yet she wants my help?”
“Be reasonable, sir. This is your mother we’re talking about. Please, won’t you put down that ridiculous knife?”
“Alright,” said Jonathan, though he ignored that last request. “I’ll humour you. What does she want me to do?”
“Better I show you than explain,” Manfred replied. “Shall we step outside?”
“Lead the way,” said Jonathan, still waving about the pocket knife like a lunatic.
The butler took him outside, using the back door, which led into the garden. Jonathan followed, still constantly checking over his shoulder from concern that he would be jumped at any moment by men in crow-faced masks or shot in the neck with another dart.
As they stepped outside it became immediately apparent what the manservant wanted to show him. The Grimmer Company’s airship was parked outside, tethered to a post that had been mounted in the garden specifically for that purpose. But the airship was almost unrecognisable as the Penny Dreadful, as it had been entirely made over while he’d been below ground.
He looked at it in wonder. It really was like a whole new airship.</Text>
            <Notes>Removed:
 There was a note on the nightstand in the neat and flowing script of the family butler.
He picked it up and scanned its contents. It read simply, “Things are not what they seem. I will explain everything when you regain consciousness. You must trust me.”
He set it down. He wished he could. He wished he could trust anyone at all. But while he was sure that things were indeed not what they seemed, he honestly believed that the only person he could trust at all at this juncture was a woman whose real name he didn’t even know. Miss Monday.
He wondered what had happened to her. He had little hope that she had simply been returned to her own home with a politely written note on her beside table. She was likely still locked up in the underground facility, if she was still alive.
But he had to turn that thought aside as well, for now. He’d worry about her rescue once he’d secured his own. As to that end, </Notes>

            <Title>Mrs. Grimmer</Title>
            <Text>Mrs. Elizabeth Grimmer

Role in Story:		Support
Occupation:		Chief Financial Officer
 	

Physical Description:	Grandness of stature was obviously a family trait; Mrs. Grimmer could in no way at all possible be considered small, especially for a lady; even in comparison to her son, she seemed a bit of a giant. As if by way of distracting from her impressive height, Mrs. Grimmer seemed to flaunt her exorbitant wealth, wearing it in jewels, perfume, and skirts.

Personality:		Blunt, cold, sarcastic, and self-centred, Mrs. Grimmer is concerned about very little other than her own appearance and social standing. She maintains an acquaintanceship with the Queen Victoria, which she likes to bring up in conversation whenever possible.  Of course, there is more to Mrs. Grimmer than one might initially realise. While on the surface she seems self-centred and superficial, in truth, this is only her way of trying to control her emotions. At times she blames her son for the death of her husband, but she pretends that nothing bothers her, that she is just a bitter, materialistic woman. She cares deeply for her son, but she has difficulty reconciling the death of her husband.

Habits/Mannerisms:	She has a knack for annoyingly flawless punctuality.
 	

Background:		Although Mrs. Grimmer’s position as Chief Financial Officer amounted to little more than financier and glorified accountant, the Agency’s employees had become accustomed to taking directives from her. This was more to do with her habit of threatening to reduce funding to those departments whose agents failed to comply with her sometimes lofty demands than legitimate respect for her authority, but still. The adamant way in which she impressed her own importance upon the Agents seemed to be working.  As a result, Mr. O, who was both Mrs. Grimmer’s son and the official Orchestrator of the Agency, found that his own ability to command respect was waning, while his mother seemed to increasingly hold more sway. Recently, he had even been forced to take on missions that Mrs. Grimmer lacked the authority to assign. Indeed, so long as the Agency continued to be privately funded by the Grimmer family fortune, Mr. O had little choice but to tolerate his mother’s interference.

Internal Conflicts:		Mrs. Grimmer does wish to be a good mother to her son, but she’s not the best at showing her feelings. At least some aspects of her personality are affected, as a defence mechanism.

External Conflicts:		She must do what she can in the battle against the unliving. She does so while pretending to be uninterested and unconcerned.

Notes:		Mrs. Grimmer is a widow; Mr. Grimmer was killed by Mr. O, his son, who at the time was infected with an early version of the Lazarus Virus. Although Mr. O was able to be cured, the current mutation of the plague is more robust, and cannot be cured so easily.</Text>

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>The elevator descended with its steady mechanical rhythm, down, down toward the basement of the real Agency, the one whose mandate was to exterminate the unliving while guarding the world’s most dangerous secret. Lazarus.
It was Mr. O’s belief—and his father’s belief, before him—that if man discovered anything sufficiently deadly, he would find a way to use it as a weapon. Electricity, fire, even gravity could be used as instruments of war. And disease was no exception. Disease could, and had, been used to great effect as weapon. The British Army had used it when they gave blankets contaminated with smallpox to the Native Americans. And during the times of the Black Death, plague corpses had been used in warfare. Throughout history, there were instances of contaminating wells with the diseased remains of infected animals.
But this disease, this virus, if it were to be used as a weapon, as he feared, the devastation it would unleash would be beyond what anyone could imagine. Virulent in its effects, highly volatile, and incredibly contagious, the Lazarus Virus was unlike any other disease known to man.
The horde of the unliving they’d faced on the banks of the Thames, with their mechanized, clockwork corpses, seemed to lead to the unsettling conclusion that his worst nightmare had become a reality. Somebody was using the virus as a weapon. The Society of Immortals. As sure as he lived and breathed.
The elevator shuddered to a halt. He slid open the gate and stepped out, into his underground office, dragging the heavy duffel bag behind him. Miss Monday followed him out of the elevator and closed the gate shut.
Leaving the body bag in the corner of the room, Mr. O turned on a lamp, bathing the room in warm gas light. Shadows flickered around the room.
The office was as she remembered it. A bit small and somewhat disorderly, but not necessarily cramped. On one wall sat the large wooden desk where Mr. O did the majority of his work. His large, well-used leather chair sat behind it. A series of bookshelves and filing cabinets lined the other walls, and a few small wooden chairs sat in the corners of the room and in front of his desk.
Mr. O settled into his own chair, behind his desk, and Miss Monday chose the surprisingly comfortable wooden chair in front of it.
“I thought you were going to have a bath and a bottle of liquor,” said Miss Monday.
Mr. O stood up, winked at her, and retrieved a bottle of wine from his liquor cabinet. He poured out two glasses and slid one across the desk.
“I was quite serious about the drink, although it appears I’m fresh out of my usual supply, so I suppose that wine shall have to suffice, for now. But as much as I’d love to wash the blood from my hair and clothes and scrub the filth from my fingernails, I wanted even more to discuss the day’s misadventures with you before my mother returns to shove her nose in my business as she so often does.”
“Right,” said Miss Monday.
Mr. O grimaced at the taste of the wine he’d forgotten wasn’t gin or rum or something else stronger. He’d been quite taken with vodka lately, and with absinthe. He routinely switched from liquor to liquor as constantly as a prostitute changes johns.
“So,” he said, placing his glass down upon his desk. “Quite the adventure, wasn’t it?”
“Well, I can’t say I was bored,” she admitted. “But are we really any closer to finding out who killed Lord Connor? What can we really expect to find when the doctor examines the body we hauled back here?”
Mr. O shrugged. “Honestly, I haven’t the foggiest idea. I’m just hoping we’ll catch a lucky break. Until we track down Connor’s killer, both our lives are in danger. Anyone who knows anything at all about the unliving may be a target.”
She looked at him sceptically. “I’ve been meaning to ask you. What makes you think Lord Connor was a member of the Society of Immortals?”
“One of the methods we employ to keep the unliving threat at bay is the use of a machine which allows us to intercept telegraphs,” he said. “The machine then scans for specific key words, which allows us to track instances of sightings without the need to read each and every telegram we intercept.”
“So you happened upon a telegram that implicated Lord Connor as a member of the Society?”
Mr. O smiled and nodded. He was pleased that she was keeping up with his explanation, and even more pleased that she hadn’t asked for a breakdown of the telegram interception machine. He had no idea how it worked himself, but he preferred not to admit that.
“Connor was a member of the Society, I’m certain of it. That’s what got him killed. I don’t know what was in his safe, but whatever it was, he must have known they were after it.”
“Yes,” Miss Monday agreed. “That much is obvious. Why else lock blank sheets of paper in a safe? So where would he have moved the real package, whatever it was?”
Mr. O shrugged. “I’m still missing a piece of the puzzle,” he said.
Miss Monday folded her arms. “Which piece?”
Mr. O smiled without any joviality. He took a swig of his dissatisfying wine. “That is the question,” he said, “And I hate to bring it up again, but I believe it must all be connected. I know I am surely stepping well beyond the boundaries of etiquette by asking, yet again, but I’m afraid I must. Your clockwork eye.”
Miss Monday flinched and looked away. Since he’d met him, he hadn’t said a word about it. Not until they’d found the strange clockwork contraption surgically attached to the dead girl. Honestly, that was one of the reasons she put up with him. One of the reasons she’d let him kiss her.
She shook her head as if she could shake that thought away.
“Where did you get it?” he persisted, “And from whom? And how does it work?”
She sighed. She knew he would not have asked if he didn’t think it was relevant, and of course she knew, instinctively, that he was right. Her story was intricately tied with this new breed of the Unliving. The fusion of organic tissue with highly advanced mechanical devices. Miss Monday’s clockwork prosthetics. And the strange contraption on the living dead girl.
If she wanted Mr. O to trust her, she couldn’t keep this from him.
“Alright,” she said, at last, “I’ll tell you. I’ll tell you everything.”
Then she swallowed the whole of her glass of one, in one swift gulp.</Text>

            <Text>London Fog

London Fog is a story that takes place in 1901 London and centres on Parson Sinews. Despite his affluence, charm, and wit, the rumours that surround him tell a different story entirely – he’s a villain, a sadist, a criminal, an opium addict, an absinthe enthusiast, a murderer, an Irishman, and a vampire. The true story of our antihero will be discovered throughout the story, as he becomes the target of a witch hunt and uses any means necessary to prove his innocence in the brutal murder of Lord Connor. Of course, there’s more at stake than merely proving his innocence; there’s also revenge to be had and a mystery to uncover. This is a revenge story and murder mystery all in one, a thriller with hints of horror, steampunk and fantasy.</Text>

            <Title>Scene 59</Title>
            <Synopsis>Jonathan, Annabel, Roderick, Abraham Palmer, Prof. Ashcroft, and Kip Lockwood confer over tea.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The airship was high above the dying city of London, above the clouds, sailing through the aether. Far enough above the city that they could no longer hear the apocalyptic sounds from the ground below. The screams of the living as they watched their friends and family members die, only to turn on them. The inhuman moan of the zombies as they hunted for living flesh. The shattering of glass as the creatures broke into homes and businesses; even in their homes the living were not safe.
The airship was as steady as solid ground, with only a light breeze stirring the air. The whir of propellers and the chunk-chunk of the engines kept up a steady rhythm.
While Jonathan generally disliked air travel, the airship was not without its comforts. At any rate, it was preferable to being on the ground at the moment. Jonathan had nonetheless plopped herself into a chair with an audible sigh. Then he rang the bell for tea.
His first inclination had been absinthe, but the bright green bottle had lost its appeal at the moment. It reminded him of Parson Sinews, his furious battle with the police as they made their arrest. It was hard to believe that had only been the night before.
Across from Jonathan sat Abraham Palmer. To his left, Miss Monday. And to his right, Roderick Steen, Kipper Lockwood, and Kass. He had been surprised to find Roderick aboard his ship when he, Palmer, and Monday had finally reached Newgate. Apparently, Mr. Lockwood—with the help of some of the airship crew—had managed to rescue Roderick, who had been trapped in a cell, surrounded by zombies. They had not found Parson Sinews, but thanks to Miss Monday’s efforts, they now knew that Sinews was being held prisoner by the Resurrectionists.
After a long, trying day, tea was not just a comfort. It was a necessity. It was served with sandwiches and sweets, lemon tarts and soft warm bread. Because Kip and Kass had rescued his best friend, Jonathan had thought it appropriate to invite them to tea.
He watched Kip tear into his sandwich with relish. He wore a mustache of tea on his upper lip. Miss Monday sipped her tea delicately, her eyes scanning the room warily.
She had told her story over their first cup of tea. How the Resurrectionists had taken the prize she’d stolen from Connor’s safe, and used it to unleash the Lazarus Virus. How she’d followed Palmer and Mrs. Grimmer down into the Resurrectionist laboratory, where she’d seen the zombie in its tank, and where she met Dr. Jekyll, who had explained the Dead London Project—the Resurrectionists intended to cure death. To do so, they needed to find someone who was immune to Lazarus. How she’d been taken prisoner, and met her fellow captive—Parson Sinews. How she’d made her escape, after a brief confrontation with Anthony Tidkins.
They were comparing notes. Jonathan’s own findings were much the same as hers. He told the gathered party about his own meeting with Parson Sinews, and what Sinews had told him about the Dead London Project. He told them about Sinews’ arrest; the police believed Sinews was the Resurrection Man.
Miss Monday snorted. “The police are wrong,” she said. “I’ve met Mr. Sinews, and I’ve met Anthony Tidkins. They are not the same man.”
“I agree,” Roderick said, “But Detective Inspector Taggert said he spoke to a witness who swore up and down that Sinews was the Resurrection Man. It was Taggert—god rest his idiotic soul—who sent the Black Mariahs to arrest Sinews.”
“Mr. Ocelot believed his employer, Mr. Sinews, was used by the Resurrectionists as a scapegoat. The so-called witness was likely a Resurrectionist. A convenient way to get rid of Mr. Sinews, who might have been a threat to the Dead London Project,” said Jonathan. “Mr. Sinews believed my father’s death was not an accident. He suggested my father might have been killed by the Resurrectionists.”
He noticed Palmer looking down at his tea, and directed his attention at him.
“After my meeting with Mr. Sinews, I headed to the Grimmer and Sons headquarters, where I spoke with Mr. Palmer,” he said.
Jonathan sat back in his chair and sipped his tea thoughtfully. He gave a brief summary of his conversation with Palmer to the rest of the party. All eyes seemed to turn on Palmer.
Palmer nodded.
“Yes, I suppose you want an explanation,” he said. He took a sip of tea, wincing with pain from his gunshot wound. “What Jonathan says is true. Beneath the Grimmer Company is a laboratory. It was used to study the effects of the Lazarus Virus, these inhuman creatures you call zombies. Mr. Grimmer and I have been hunting these creatures for years now, since Jonathan was a boy.”
Miss Monday frowned seriously, scrutinizing Palmer with an unreadable expression. It was impossible to know what thoughts lay behind those eyes, when one of them was made of brass, polished wood, and polarized glass. She gulped back her tea as if it was the last cup on earth. Jonathan raised an eyebrow.
“It’s been a long day,” she said with a dismissive shrug, “I find tea to be quite the restorative, don’t you?”
Jonathan had to agree. He nodded.
“Drink tea. Kill zombies,” she said, “If that’s what life is going to be from now on, we might as well do what we can to enjoy it.”
“I like this girl, Jonathan,” said Roderick. “She has fire.”
Miss Monday grinned.
Jonathan returned her smile. True, she did have fire. The thing about fire, though, is that it was dangerous. Beautiful, to be certain, but wild. Unpredictable. And while Miss Monday could play the part of a lady, Jonathan knew that she was not the delicate woman she looked like on the surface. What was it that Parson Sinews had said? We are all moths, drawn to the flame. But if Jonathan was being honest, it was Miss Monday’s danger that drew him to her, and at the same time frightened him.
He looked back at Palmer, who continued as if uninterrupted. “When the Resurrectionists found out about the laboratory, they began to make arrangements to take it over. Rather than let that happen, we offered to work with them. We provided unrestricted access to the lab, believing that this would make it easier to monitor their activities. We now know that even though we were able to keep an eye on them, they were still able to keep secrets from us. We knew about Dead London, but we didn’t know they planned to begin the experiment so soon. What you have to understand, though, is that even if we had all the information, it would have been impossible to stop the Resurrectionists. Their identities are such closely guarded secrets, it’s impossible to even know how many of them there are. We do know that they have members in all areas of society. Not just scientists, but policemen, soldiers, even aristocrats—Lord Connor being just one example. Rumor has it that even Queen Victoria is sympathetic to the Resurrectionist cause.”
“Queen Victoria supported the idea of turning London into a city of the dead?” Jonathan scoffed.
“The Resurrectionists believe they can conquer death. Queen Victoria is getting old. She was promised immortality. Yes, we believe she supported the Dead London Project.”
Jonathan fell silent and took a sip of tea. He nibbled on a treacle tart, as he stared at Palmer. The tart was probably the first thing he’d eaten in days, now that he thought about it.
Palmer was badly wounded, his shoulder bandaged with a strip of cloth from Miss Monday’s skirt. He tried to hide a grimace as he lifted his teacup to his lips. Blood had seeped through his bandage.
“So,” said Roderick, “The Resurrectionists believe they can use the Lazarus Virus to cheat death? And to do so, they need to find someone who possesses a natural immunity?”
Palmer nodded.
“It begs the question,” Roderick continued, “Suppose we manage to come up with a way to stop the Resurrectionists, to defeat them once and for all—should we?”
“What do you mean?” asked Kass, who’d been silent all this time. “Surely we should stop them if given the chance.”
“Even if that means the city will be overrun by zombies with no hope of a cure?” Roderick countered.
“The Resurrectionists are not the only scientists in the world. If we could find someone with an immunity to the virus—before they do—could we not find a cure on our own?” asked Kass.
“There are years worth of research in that laboratory,” said Palmer. “Without that research, a cure could take years, decades even.”
“Good then!” Roderick exclaimed, “We have our answer. We’ll simply have to steal the research back.”
Miss Monday sat upright and grinned. “Did someone say steal?”
“Ah, yes,” said Jonathan. “Did I mention—Miss Monday is a cat burglar.”
“Never liked that term. Hate cats. I like to call it what it is. I’m a thief.” 
“Thief it is.” Jonathan flashed a smile at her.
“Speaking of thievery,” she said. “Something that’s been bothering me. It was the Resurrectionists that put me up to robbing Connor’s safe. But we now know they already had access to the virus. Whatever they wanted me to steal from Connor, it was more than just the virus. When I mentioned the green liquid I took from Connor’s safe, Dr. Jekyll said that Francis Varney’s contribution to the Dead London Project was a means of distributing the virus. According to Dr. Jekyll, this green liquid, which contains the virus, is easily converted into gaseous form. Why did Lord Connor have Varney’s green liquid in his safe?”
Jonathan’s eyes widened. He took something from his pocket, and showed it to Miss Monday. The scrap of paper with burnt edges. Lord Henry Connor is Francis Varney.
“That explains it. They had the virus; what they didn’t have was a means of distributing it. Varney’s solution, combined with Anthony Tidkins’ clockwork bird, made it easy for them spread the virus,” said Miss Monday. “And I helped them do it. God, I feel sick.”
Hastily, she set aside her tea and got out of her seat. “Would you excuse me a moment, gentlemen? Clockwork parts to wind.”
She crossed the large room, found herself a table and a mirror, far enough from Jonathan and Mr. Palmer that she could wind up her gears without interrupting their tea, but close enough that she could still follow the conversation.
“So what now?” said Jonathan. “We just head back to the Grimmer Company, break in, steal their research? Simple as that?”
“Yes, well, if it’s not too much to ask, I’d like to stop at home first,” said Roderick.
Jonathan inclined his head, wondering if his friend had something up his sleeve.
“I need to check on Bailey,” Roderick explained. “Poor boy’s been home alone all day.”
“Then we break in to the secret lab and steal the research?” asked Miss Monday.
“Unless I’ve missed something, there’s still the matter of the individual with the immunity to the virus,” said Kass.
“About that,” said Miss Monday. “Mr. Palmer suggested that I might be immune.”
“What? Why would she be immune?” asked Kass, turning to Palmer.
Miss Monday answered. “For one, because I’ve already been infected, and I have no symptoms of the virus,” she said. Jonathan stared at her in alarm. “And for another thing, it’s not the first time I’ve been exposed to the virus.”
“My god!” Kip exclaimed.
Jonathan’s mouth hung open. “What do you mean? When?”
Miss Monday finished winding her clockwork. She fit her prosthetic eye back into its socket with a click, and got up to rejoin them.
“There’s something you should know,” she said. “Something you should all know about me.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene Three</Title>
            <Text>Miss Monday did not wait long after Mr. O’s departure before taking her own leave of her apartment. Adding the stolen contents of Lord Connor’s safe to her picnic basket, she grabbed an umbrella from a rack, and headed out the door.
She closed the door, secured it with a key that hung from her neck like a pendant, and headed down the hall toward the exit of her building.
“Miss Gray,” said a pleasant and familiar voice.
“Miss Thompson,” Miss Monday replied, as Gray was the name she used when she wasn’t playing her part in the criminal underground. She smiled as she spun about to greet her neighbour. “How do you do?”
“I noticed you had a gentleman visitor this afternoon,” said Miss Thompson, a delicate young lady some five years Miss Monday’s junior, who lived alone in the suite opposite Miss Monday’s own.  Pretty, petite, and auburn-haired, Miss Thompson had an envy-inspiring beauty, which she displayed with controversially high skirts and low-cut shirts. Her lips were painted bright red and her eyes were cosmetically darkened.
“Would it be incredibly impolite of me to ask who he was?” said Miss Thompson.
Miss Monday’s smile disappeared.
“Mr. O,” she said, in a voice that brooked no argument about the quality of his character.
“Oh,” said her neighbour, “Oh, I’m sorry.  I didn’t mean to go poking my nose in your business.  It’s just that he was so handsome, and ever so courteous, I couldn’t help my curiosity over this distinguished visitor of yours.”
“You spoke with him?”
“Only briefly,” said Miss Thompson, looking apologetic, “As we had bumped into one another in the hallway.  He told me that he works for a printing company that publishes penny dreadfuls.”
Miss Monday snorted at that.
“Such a douche,” she said, disdainfully, summoning the word from the aether.  For all of Miss Monday’s wealth, and for all her intellect, she still possessed a vocabulary that showed just a glimpse of her lower class upbringing; not that she’d heard that word growing up, at least not as a slang. It just seemed to have the right sort of vulgarity to suit how she felt about Mr. O just then.
Rather than raise an eyebrow at Miss Monday’s curious word choice, Miss Thompson gasped, instantly grasping the word’s vulgarity and sensing that it was meant pejoratively.
“No,” she said gently, “He can’t possibly be so bad as that.”
“He is,” protested Miss Monday, “He is a paragon of all things douchey.”
“Come now,” said Miss Thompson, “He seemed a perfect gentleman.”
“If you were to put him in a room with an actual douche,” she stubbornly continued, “I would be powerless to tell the two apart, such is the extent of his douchiness."
Miss Thompson put a hand on her friend’s arm, suddenly concerned.  “Was his behaviour...less than gentlemanly?" she said delicately
Miss Monday sighed.  “He offered me a job,” she said at last.
“What a douche!” exclaimed Miss Thompson, with mock indignance.
Miss Monday laughed. “I’m sure you’re right, as always. I’m likely judging him more harshly than he deserves. But still. I find that somehow he rather manages to get under my skin.”
“Hm,” said Miss Thompson.
“Hm what?”
“Irritation is often a symptom of affection,” said Miss Thompson. “Perhaps he irritates you simply because you-”
“No,” said Miss Monday, cutting her off. “Don’t say it. Anyway, he’s not my type. Not,” she was quick to point out, “That I’ve been with many men.”
“Who am I to judge?” said her neighbour, with a wink, which led further credence to Miss Monday’s theory about what her neighbour did for a living. “Anyway, what is your type?”
Miss Monday nearly shrugged, though she caught herself in the gesture, and she quickly put a stop to that. “I like my men how I like my books. Witty, adventurous, and with a hint of mystery,” she said.
Miss Thompson laughed. “I hate to say it, but that sounds like Mister O to a tee,” she said.
Miss Monday winced.
“Where did you meet him anyway?”
Miss Monday told her about Lord Connor’s party, sparing of course some of the more gruesome details. She did admit though, that she’d gained admittance to the ball without an invitation, which earned Miss Thompson's admiration and jealousy.
Her friend had read about the ball in the morning paper, and had learned about the mysterious death of Lord Connor. Apparently, a mysterious masked gentleman had been seen leaving Lord Connor’s study. Miss Monday feigned ignorance as Miss Thompson revealed these details to her with excitement.
“Did you see this mysterious masked man?” she asked.
“Well, it was a masquerade, and I was not invited,” said Miss Monday, “Every gentleman present was a mysterious masked man to me.”
“Do you think it possible,” said Miss Thompson, “That you could have crossed paths with this murderer, without even knowing?”
“Oh, I don’t know,” she replied, “I doubt it. I didn’t stay long, I was so nervous about being caught trespassing at Lord Connor’s manor.”
“Oh,” said Miss Thompson, disappointment creeping into her voice.
Miss Monday made her excuses and bid good day to her neighbour. Then she made her way outside with the parcel tucked into her picnic basket.</Text>

            <Title>Outline</Title>
            <Text>Part One
- Chateau d’If is a Resurrectionist airship prison. The ship floats at a high altitude, refuels in mid-air, and rarely needs to make a landing. As a result, it’s impossible for the prisoners to escape without plummeting to their death. Nonetheless, one of the prisoners manages to escape.
- London is under quarantine; the Resurrectionists who once manned the wall have been overthrown by the British military, who now man the walls. However, a rumour persists that they still operate a top secret facility, inaccessible because it’s within the quarantined London.
- Annabel and Jonathan have spent the past few years searching for any trace of the Resurrectionists Dr. Jekyll and Mircalla Karnstein, hoping they may lead them to find Mrs. Grimmer; they believe she’s been taken to Chateau d’If. Along the way, they’ve been hunting down any zombies who have escaped the confines of London. Their work is officially sanctioned and funded by the Crown, but they suspect the Queen may have ulterior motives.
- Roderick, meanwhile, has settled in Paris, where he continues his work as an artist and tries to live a relatively quiet existence.
- Dr. Karnstein manages to track him down, she and her Resurrectionist cronies corner him, and ask for his assistance with locating an escaped prisoner. They don’t seem to know that he was responsible for Anthony Tidkins’ death—only that he helped the police solve a number of crimes.
- Sinews, the escaped prisoner, has been following Dr. Karnstein. He sneaks up behind her and slits her throat. He then strips off her mask, and realizes it’s not her.
- Roderick agrees to help Sinews, and sends a message to Jonathan, letting him know he’s found Parson Sinews.

Part Two
- Jonathan and Annabel meet Roderick and Parson in Paris, then head back to London. There, they convene at Sinews’ home in the countryside. Henry Charles Ocelot is waiting for them there, and has moved Sinews’ strange “opium den” from London to the cottage.
- Annabel, Roderick, and Jonathan are forced to reconsider their allies, but eventually decide to stick it out with Sinews, who promises to take them to the Resurrectionists’ new laboratory within London.
- The crew manages to cross the London wall and get inside the quarantined area, which is overrun by zombies and filled with deadly poisoned gas. Using gas masks, they navigate the toxic city in order to hunt down the Resurrectionists and find Mrs. Grimmer.</Text>

            <Title>Scene Four</Title>
            <Text>The weather was cold, as it often was in London, but at least it was not raining. The day was overcast and gloomy, but Miss Monday had dressed sensibly, with a riding jacket and scarf. She carried an umbrella, just in case the weather were to change without warning. She’d worn a pair of her finest and warmest gloves, and a skirt that could be worn among London’s elite but which would also keep her warm.
She hailed a cab, as she kept no horse and carriage of her own, and did not employ her own driver. On the busy streets of London, it was not difficult to find an available cab, so Miss Monday climbed into the first available hansom cab that stopped for her.
She gave the directions to her driver, who gave her a curt nod. He urged the horse onward with a crack of the whip, and they were on their way. The horse’s gait was quick and musical as it clopped along the cobblestone. The little carriage rattled as it rolled along the street toward Hyde Park.
Perhaps her paranoia was born out of habit, a result of her unusual career choice, or perhaps it was not paranoia but suspicion. In either case, she began to suspect that she was being followed, as they made their way.
“Can we go any faster?” she asked the driver.
He responded with another crack of the whip, which spurred the horse on to a quicker pace. She watched as the driver of the carriage in suspicion cracked his own whip and urged his own horse to pick up speed.
“Right,” she said, “Turn right here.”
“But Miss,” said the driver.
“Hard right,” she insisted, though Hyde Park was in the opposite direction.
The driver shrugged and made the turn. They tore around the corner, taking the turn roughly. The cab bounced hard on the pavement. It rattled and lurched as they sped around the curve, but the driver managed to keep the vehicle upright. Miss Monday tossed him an extra coin for his troubles, and he responded by urging the horse to even greater speed.
“Left here,” she said. She craned her neck around to watch as the other carriage pursued them still, similarly taking the corner with reckless abandon.
There was no longer any doubt that she was being followed.
They took the next corner with even greater speed than the first, so that they nearly collided with the cab in front of them. The driver’s expert reaction was to steer around the other vehicle, taking the wrong side of the street in order to pass it.
Miss Monday figured that if she kept feeding coins to her driver, he might not mind keeping this reckless pace, so she tossed him another and directed him to hang a left.
He did as she commanded, but the coach responded in kind, matching their every move. She couldn’t guess who it was that was following her, but whoever it was, they were persistent.
Miss Monday had no shortage of enemies. In her line of work, enemies were unavoidable. Nonetheless, her intuition told her this had something to do with Lord Connor and his unnatural resurrection. 
She patted her side and took comfort in the slight revolver-shaped bulge that she felt there. She considered for a moment simply allowing the other vehicle to catch up. She could then discover the vehicle’s occupant, then blast him to bits with her revolver. But she decided against it. Her pursuer would surely be armed. Not a good idea to risk him catching up.
The other vehicle, a large four-wheeled coach, pulled by two horses, was not light or quick enough to match speed with the lighter, more nimble hansom with its coin-inspired driver. They should be able to lose their pursuers if the horse could keep up its speed.
Besides, it was too early in the morning for a gunfight.
“Take the next right,” she instructed.
They took the corner at breakneck speed. The cab threatened to roll over. Miss Monday braced herself for a fall. She heard the thunder of galloping hooves, and felt the carriage roll up onto one wheel.
“Hold on, miss,” said the driver.
At last, the driver managed to get the cabriolet back under control. Its second wheel touched back down again, and they were off.
“Keep going,” she urged, though her heart was thundering just as quick as the mare in front of them.
She turned around in her seat, but she could hardly see a thing from where she sat. So she leaned her head out the window. She looked back and saw the carriage, still following them. It was faster than she’d expected it to be. She cursed, and pulled her head back inside.
“We’ve got to lose that carriage,” she said to the driver. She stuck another coin through the window for him. The driver looked behind and saw the vehicle in question.
“I’ll see what I can do,” he said.

            <Text>“I was a much younger woman back then—a girl, really—and if it can be believed, even prettier than I am now.”
Jonathan grinned. “Impossible,” he said.
Miss Monday smiled.
They were seated in the lounge, aboard the Penny Dreadful, high above the dying city of London. Far enough above the city that they could no longer hear the apocalyptic sounds from the ground below. The screams of the living as they watched their friends and family members die, only to turn on them. The inhuman pining of the zombies as they hunted for living flesh. The shattering of glass as the creatures broke into homes and businesses, for even there the living were not safe.
While Miss Monday had complained of airsickness, the airship was not without its comforts. At any rate, it was preferable to being on the ground at the moment. Miss Monday had nonetheless plopped herself into a chair with an audible sigh. And with blood still spattered upon her face and clothes—and unless Jonathan was mistaken, that was a human finger stuck in her hair—she was settled in comfortably, drinking cup of tea. He thought about alerting her to the presence of the finger, but decided against it.
With Henry Charles Ocelot to his right, also looking a little worse for wear, and with Mrs. Hatton seated next to Miss Monday, he leaned forward in his seat. At last, Miss Monday had been persuaded to reveal how she’d lost her arm and eye, and Jonathan, for one, was anxious to know her story. Even if it was too late for London, it seemed important to understand.
“I was still new to my profession. Until very recently I’d been picking pockets and stealing things that were of very little worth to anyone. That all changed, of course, when I met a man who wanted to steal something more valuable. His name was Jack Bernhardt. I had met him previously, and he had been kind to me. I began to see him more regularly, and he would often buy me lunch. Sometimes, he would bring me a clean dress or a new hat. Simple enough presents that might not have meant much at all to the average person, but I was a street girl. An orphan. To me, it meant the world. I came to think of him like a father, for the way he looked after me. So, when he asked me to steal research from a military laboratory, you can imagine my answer.”
“Was your mission was a success?” Jonathan asked.
Miss Monday snorted, indicating what she thought of his question. Of course she’d been successful.
“Why did he want you to steal research?”
“Bernhardt was a doctor. A physician. Although he was somewhat of a Jack of all trades. Eventually I learned that he had been conducting scientific experiments. He also enjoyed tinkering with rather whimsical inventions. Clockwork dolls and such things. He was something of a genius. A child prodigy, too. According to some of his friends, who I met through my association with him, Jack never spent a single day in school. He learned it all from books, and from his mentor. Dr. Allen.”
Jonathan noticed Mr. Ocelot’s fist clench at the mention of that name. Mrs. Hatton’s eyes narrowed.
“Anyway,” Miss Monday went on. “Jack later hired me for a mission. We were to travel from London, all the way to the small island of Haiti. I travelled via dirigible, with Jack as my constant companion. I’d come to accept that he was an eccentric young man, but I hadn’t quite understood the extent of his eccentricities until we began to travel together.
Throughout the duration of the journey, he had been toiling with one of his inventions: a pair of wings, which, when strapped to his back would apparently allow him to glide on the wind as if he were flying. He’d been collecting the feathers of crows throughout the journey, and I imagine he’d been collecting them long before we embarked on our trip. Anyway, he’d been sewing the feathers to these artificial wings, bit by bit covering the leather and wooden hang glider in black feathers. Like black Icarus wings.
Whatever his obsession with crows, I can’t say, but his eccentricities had never bothered me. As I said, he’d been somewhat of a father to me. He was wealthy, but not excessively; the ship itself was perhaps the smallest dirigible I’d ever seen, barely big enough to fit the both of us, and it was not richly detailed or lushly decorated like this one. Of course, I was hardly one to complain, and at least my salary was fair. Or so I thought.
That was before I knew exactly what the job would entail. At that point, I knew only the few details that Jack had provided. As I said, it was an expedition to Haiti. I knew that much. But I did not yet know about the Bokor.”
“The what?” said Jonathan.
“The Bokor,” Miss Monday repeated. “A vodou word, meaning sorcerer. I’m not sure I can explain it as precisely as Jack eventually did, but are you at all familiar with vodou?”
“I vaguely recall having once read an article from the Royal Geographical Society on the subject,” said Jonathan, “But I can’t say I remember much about it.”
Henry Charles Ocelot nodded.
“I know a thing or two about that subject,” he said in his deep baritone voice. “As Miss Monday says, a bokor is a sorceror. Practitioners of vodou believe in spirits called loa. You might think of the loa as gods. The bokor is a servant of the loa, so in this way, he is like a priest. He does not practice magic. He merely serves the loa.”
“But not all loa are kind, benevolent spirits, isn’t that right, Mr. Ocelot?” said Miss Monday.
“They say that a bokor serves with both hands. On the one hand, the light—healing the sick, protecting the weak. On the other hand, the dark. A bokor that embraces this sort of power is supposedly able to raise the dead.”
Jonathan repeated those words, inflecting meaning into them. “Raise the dead, eh?” he muttered.
“Yes, precisely my point,” said Miss Monday. “This particular bokor had apparently amassed quite the following, though his people also feared him. They called him Papa Doc because he was healer. The light, on the one hand. On the other hand, he had been using his power as a political weapon, creating fear and propaganda. Even his own people feared him, and he slaughtered those who questioned him with uncompromising mercilessness.”
“Nice chap,” said Jonathan.
“Yes, well, they made him president.”</Text>

            <Text>“I was a much younger woman back then—a girl, really—and if it can be believed, even prettier than I am now,” said Miss Monday, with a wink of her one eye.
“Impossible,” he said, smirking.
Miss Monday grinned, her cheeks dimpling.
“I was still new to my profession. Until very recently I’d been picking pockets and stealing things that were of very little worth to anyone. That all changed when I met a man who wanted to steal something more valuable. His name—when I met him—was Jack Bernhardt. I had met him previously, and he had been kind to me.

Simple enough presents that might not have meant much at all to an ordinary person, but I was a street girl. An orphan. To me, it meant the world. I came to think of him like an older brother. He looked out for me, and he asked nothing in return. So, when at last he did ask something of me, you can imagine my answer.”
“What did he want you to steal?” Jonathan asked.
“Research.”
“Why? What sort of research?” asked Mr. Palmer.
“Bernhardt was a doctor. A physician. Although he was somewhat of a Jack of all trades—no pun intended. Eventually I learned that he had been conducting scientific experiments—of all sorts. He also enjoyed tinkering with rather whimsical inventions. Clockwork dolls and such things. He was something of a genius, and had apparently been a child prodigy, too. According to some of his friends, who I met through my association with him, he never spent a single day in school. I’m not sure if that’s true, but that’s what they said. He learned it all from books, and from his mentor. But his real talent was people. He understood people, was quick to recognize their talents and their weaknesses, and to apply their strengths to his own ends. He often collaborated with other scientists, or hired them to work on his projects. And when others refused to work for him, he would use me.”
“He’d steal their research, you mean?”
“Yes,” Miss Monday said. “Anyway, on one particular mission, we were to travel from London all the way to the small island of Haiti. I travelled via dirigible, with Jack as my constant companion. I’d come to accept that he was an eccentric young man, but I hadn’t quite understood the extent of his eccentricities until we began to travel together.

Anyway, he’d been sewing the feathers to these artificial wings, bit by bit covering the leather and wooden contraption in black feathers, fashioning it into black Icarus wings.
“Whatever his obsession with crows was, I can’t say, but his eccentricities had never bothered me. As I said, he’d been like a brother to me. I never questioned him. He was wealthy, but not excessively; the ship itself was perhaps the smallest dirigible I’d ever seen, barely big enough to fit the both of us, and it was not richly detailed or lushly decorated like this one.

“Or so I thought before I knew exactly what the job would entail. At that point, I knew only the few details that Jack had provided. As I said, it was an expedition to Haiti. I knew that much. But I did not yet know about the Bokor.”
“The what?” said Jonathan. He was sure he had heard the word before—Mr. Sinews had used it—but he couldn’t recall its precise meaning.
“The Bokor,” Miss Monday repeated. “It’s a vodou word. It means sorcerer. I’m not sure I can explain it as precisely as Jack eventually did, but are you at all familiar with vodou?”
Jonathan leaned forward. This was the second time he’d been asked that in the past few days, Parson Sinews having asked the same question. “I vaguely recall having once read an article from the Royal Geographical Society on the subject,” said Jonathan, “But I can’t say I remember much about that. However, Parson Sinews mentioned that zombies are supposedly made by vodou magic. By these vodou sorcerers.”
Miss Monday nodded.
“Practitioners of vodou believe in spirits called loa. You might think of the loa as gods. The bokor is a servant of the loa, so in this way, he is like a priest. He does not practice magic. He serves the loa.”
“But not all loa are kind, benevolent spirits, isn’t that right, Miss Monday?” asked Kass.
Jonathan raised an appraising eyebrow.
Kass shrugged. “I happen to read the Royal Geographical Society papers as well.”
“They say that a bokor serves with both hands,” Miss Monday explained. “On the one hand, the light—healing the sick, protecting the weak. On the other hand, the dark. A bokor that embraces this sort of power is supposedly able to raise the dead.”
Jonathan repeated those words, inflecting meaning into them. “Raise the dead, eh?” he muttered.
“Yes, precisely my point,” said Miss Monday. “The bokor that I was to steal from had apparently amassed quite the following, though his people also feared him. They called him Papa Doc because he was a healer. The light, on the one hand. On the other hand, he had been using his power as a political weapon, creating fear and propaganda. Even his own people feared him, and he slaughtered those who questioned him with uncompromising mercilessness. Jack estimated that Papa Doc had killed thousands.”
“Nice chap,” said Jonathan.
“Yes, well, they made him president,” she said.
“So you was there to steal from the president of ‘aiti?” asked Kip Lockwood, in awe. “My god.”
Miss Monday shook her head. “That was the pretense. You see, while Jack had assured me that I was only there to steal something from Papa Doc, I later learned that I was there to kill him.”
“My god!” Kip repeated.
Miss Monday continued. “The airship eventually touched down in the city of Port-Au-Prince, with a backdrop of sunny skies and palm trees. Jack must have been sweltering beneath his plague doctor’s mask, but still he kept it strapped to his face.
“As we climbed down from the dirigible, I heard the unmistakable but muffled voice of a lady. I looked down to see a woman in a red walking dress, her thick black hair tightly braided into cornrows. She carried a parasol and wore white gloves on her hands, which she waved to get our attention. Her neck revealed a glimpse of her smooth, coffee-brown skin. Her face was covered by a mask that was identical to the one that Jack wore. The mask of the Resurrectionists. Of course, I didn’t know what the mask meant at the time. My associates valued their anonymity even more than their comfort. She must have been sweating buckets beneath the leather mask. But in my business, discretion is the better part of valor. I assumed this was why she wore the mask. Now, I'm not so certain.
“Jack introduced her as Dr. Mircalla Karnstein, which must have been a pseudonym, given that she was the daughter of a Frenchman and a native Haitian. I can’t think of a name that’s any less French than Karnstein. Of course, in my line of work nearly everyone uses a nom de plume. I hadn’t yet become Miss Monday, so I introduced myself simply as Miss Grey. Dr. Karnstein’s English was heavily accented and at times difficult to understand, so the conversation was tedious, as neither Jack, nor I spoke a word of French. Eventually, with the niceties out of the way, she took us to a steam-powered paddlewheel boat, which she’d hired to take us the rest of the way to what she explained was the small town where it had all begun and where Papa Doc kept his army of zombies.”
“When you say zombies—” Kass began to ask.
“I mean the supposedly resurrected dead,” said Annabel. She swallowed a sip of tea, and added, “Raised and controlled by the Bokor.”
“No wonder this Papa Doc was so feared,” said Jonathan.
“You have no idea,” Annabel replied. “Shall I skip to the good part?”
“You should have begun with the good part,” said Roderick.</Text>

 The woman in question was to be our contact in Haiti.   I looked down and was surprised to see that she was fair-skinned, as I had been led to believe that the people of the island were colored.

            <Title>Scene</Title>
            <Text>Annabel flopped dramatically into the leather armchair in a way that managed to look both awkwardly painful and the very height of comfort. Her ecru dress was spattered with dried blood, none of it hers. Jonathan was staring at her.
Ignoring him, she took a sip of tea and let out of a sigh of pleasure.
“Earl grey,” she said, practically purring.
“Now?” Jonathan exclaimed.
“Now,” Annabel affirmed. “I’m not killing any more zombies today. I’m simply not. It’s been a long, hard day, and it’s tea time. The zombies can attack later.”
“Right,” Jonathan scoffed. “Good luck explaining that to the zombies when they barge their way through that door.”
Annabel shrugged off the jibe, settled more comfortably into the chair, and helped herself to a biscuit.
“But how did the zombies get onto the airship in the first place?” she wanted to know.
“They must have boarded when we landed a few days ago. They could have stowed away in the cargo hold,” Jonathan theorized.
“And gotten out of the cargo hold when Mr. Lockwood went and opened it earlier this morning,” Annabel finished.
They gave Lockwood an icy stare. Lockwood, for his part, did his best to look contrite, to both Annabel’s and Jonathan’s satisfaction. Annabel reached for her cup of tea, and Jonathan slapped her hand away. Actually slapped her hand away! Her mouth opened in an expression of shock, and moral outrage, and…
“Never mind that,” said Jonathan, “What are we going to do about the zombies?”
“What are you going to do about the zombies?” Annabel countered. “I’m going to sit here and enjoy a nice cup of Earl Grey. You’re going to deal with the zombies.”
Jonathan sighed.
“Impossible. I can’t even use my pistol. Hydrogen balloons,” he reminded her.
Annabel sighed. She was exhausted, but this conversation was quickly becoming more tiresome than the thought of dispatching some thirty-five ravenous undead cannibals with her bare hands.
“Sword?” she asked.
Jonathan set off to find one, and having done so, handed it to Annabel.
He went to the door.
“Ready?”
“As ready as I’ll ever be,” Annabel answered. “Just open the door, and then get behind me.”
She sighed, then apparently deciding it might actually be worth her trouble to get out of her chair, did so. “They’ve interrupted me at tea time. I almost pity them.”
“I do pity them,” Jonathan muttered. Then he opened the door.</Text>

            <Title>Scene 5</Title>
            <Text>Jonathan wasn’t easily shocked. From a young age, he’d been trying his hand at the family business, writing articles for his father’s papers. As a teenager, he’d often conduct research for his father’s stories, never quite taking it seriously but nonetheless often winding up in unusual situations in the name of journalism. He’d interviewed adulterers, men dressed as women, murderers, and hangmen. For a man of his profession, it was important to be able to remain calm and composed in any situation. He had to think quickly on his feet. He’d been beginning to think that nothing could surprise him.
“Oh my god!” he exclaimed now, taking in the scene.
If Jonathan had been hoping to pry answers out of Lord Connor—answers about Connor’s possible connection to the Resurrectionists—he was to be disappointed. Connor was dead. Even from where he stood, Jonathan could see the bullet hole through his skull. Connor’s killer was still struggling to get out from beneath him.
Finally, Jonathan thought to draw a weapon. He had one, a pistol, in his belt somewhere. He reached for it, drew the gun from his belt, but Connor’s killer was quicker. Much quicker.
“Drop it,” said the killer, already on his feet. His voice was cold, threatening. He had already killed Connor. It seemed that Jonathan was the only witness. It seemed unlikely that he would hesitate to shoot Jonathan now. He hesitated to relinquish his weapon, but it seemed he had little choice but to do as the killer asked. Taking care not to make any sudden moves, he set the gun on the floor.
“Kick it over here.”
Jonathan did as directed.
When he stood, the killer had moved closer and had his pistol aimed directly at Jonathan’s face. His own weapon had been stuffed into the killer’s belt.
“What are you doing here?” the killer asked him. Jonathan noticed that though his tone was threatening, his voice was high in pitch, almost feminine.
“I heard gunfire,” Jonathan told him, just barely managing to keep his voice even. He would have killed for a glass of absinthe right now. Anything to steady his nerves.
The killer cursed. “I’d hoped the applause would drown it out,” he said.
The killer eyed the body uneasily. Jonathan’s first inclination was that the killer was an enemy of the Resurrectionists. A hired killer, maybe. The way he held his pistol suggested that this was not the first time he’d killed a man. But Jonathan was a newspaper man; he knew how to read people. And this man, this supposed killer, was uncomfortable with the dead body in the room. He noticed Jonathan studying him and returned his attention to him.
“You came here alone?” he asked. “Nobody else heard the gunshot then?”
“They might have heard it but failed to recognize that it was gunfire. My father used to take me hunting,” Jonathan told him. “I know the sound of a gunshot.”
“Well, that is inconvenient. For both of us,” said the killer. “You know, you really ought to knock before you enter a room. You could have saved yourself a lot of trouble.”
Jonathan snorted. He was beginning to regain some of his usual composure, which was probably not such a good thing. It might not do to be his usual sarcastic self in the company of a killer.
“I can help you escape,” he said.
“You saw me kill an innocent man in cold blood. Why would you want to help me?” the killer asked eventually.
Jonathan eyed Lord Connor’s body. His flesh was already rotten, he noticed, as if he’d been dead for weeks. Strange.
“Lord Connor wasn’t an innocent man,” Jonathan replied. He hesitated before he said the rest. But Jonathan was either a witness to Connor’s murder, or he was an accomplice. Better, he reasoned, to be an accomplice. “Connor was dangerous; he had powerful friends. I don’t know why you’ve killed him, but I would like to.”
It was impossible to judge the killer’s reaction to this piece of information. He was masked, for one, and it was too dark to see clearly, even with the door still slightly ajar. And for another thing, his right eye was hidden behind some sort of mechanical monocle. As its clockwork gears rotated, the lens pivoted around its axis in a way that was similar to the movement of an eye. Jonathan wasn’t sure how it worked or what its purpose was, but he had the sensation that the killer was looking straight through him.
“Someone else might come up here. Do you want my help or not?”
“I could just kill you, you know. It would be simpler.” He raised his pistol as if to demonstrate, even aimed it at Jonathan’s head. He mimed shooting it, mouthing the sound of a gunshot, and blew away a puff of imagined smoke. Jonathan braced himself.
“You could,” he said, and took a deep breath.
At last, the killer holstered his pistol.
“Who are you?” said the killer, still managing to give the impression that he was looking straight through Jonathan.
“Mr. O,” he said. Jonathan had taken to writing using a pen name. He’d written a few articles using his own name, but he’d always felt that he was under his father’s shadow. With anonymity came a great sense of freedom. Mr. O was his nom de plume.
“Oh?”
“Exactly,” Jonathan replied. “And you are?”
“Monday,” said the killer, reaching out and shaking his hand. “It seems, Mr. O, that we are in this together. At the very least, for the moment. That is, assuming you would prefer to remain on my good side.”
“Are you threatening me?”
“Sorry,” said Monday, still grasping Jonathan’s hand. He stepped closer, so close Jonathan could feel Monday’s breath on his skin. “I didn’t mean to be so indirect. So let me be clear: if you betray me, I will destroy you. I won’t just kill you. I will ensure that Lord Connor’s death is pinned on you and you alone, and I will walk away laughing. So, I’ll say it again, my new and dear friend. We’re in this together, you and me. Aren’t we, Mr. O?”
Jonathan forced a smile. “Yes, I suppose we are.”</Text>
            <Comments>What's the killer going to shoot Jonathan with?  Most derringers were single shot weapons, although Remington did make a two shot version, but these .  Or, did the killer retrieve the dropped revolver?

            <Title>Scene Two</Title>
            <Text>Leaving the hansom cab behind, Miss Monday traversed the short length of the walkway toward the stables, occasionally glancing behind her as she did so. It can hardly be called paranoia if they really are following you, she thought.
And so they were.
The first few times she checked over her shoulder for her pursuer, she saw no one behind her. But when she looked again, she saw the four-wheeled coach parked where her own hansom cab had been a moment ago.
The driver she could see still sitting at the head of the carriage, but the passenger was nowhere to be seen.
She glanced around for him. If he was not in the carriage, he must this very moment be making his way toward her. She thought back to her earlier conversation with Mr. O. He’d warned her that her life was in danger.
Quickly, she hurried to hide herself among a copse of tall oaks, which stood adjacent to the stables. It was dark and quiet beneath the thick canopy of the trees, and the grass was overgrown. It felt more like a forest than a grove. She pressed her back against the back of a tall tree, feeling slightly chilled by the shade and the breeze. She held her breath and listened attentively for any sign of her pursuer.
Hearing nothing but the usual sounds of the park—the song of the birds, the occasional rustle of a squirrel moving through the branches of a tree, the unintelligible voices of distant conversations shared between the park’s many visitors, the whinnies of horses in the stable—she let out her breath.
Just as she was about to move from her hiding place, she heard the crunch of leaves nearby. A single footstep that betrayed the man’s location.
She waited, counting out the few footsteps that followed the first one. Finally, when he was undoubtedly within striking distance, she came out quite literally swinging. She brandished her umbrella as a weapon, hoping to catch the man off guard.
But when she suddenly emerged from behind the oak, her umbrella swinging in a quick, deft motion aimed at her assailant’s head, he was not there.
There was little time to contemplate the mystery of his sudden disappearance.
Suddenly, the crack of a twig from behind startled her. She swung around and found herself face to face with a man nearly twice her size. Not terribly muscular or athletic, he was nonetheless gigantic, his face scarred, rough, and covered in a thick layer of stubble. Clearly, this was not a man Miss Monday wished to come to blows with.
She half expected to look into his eyes and see the grey and lifeless eyes of Lord Connor, but this was a living man, monstrous only in size and appearance.
As she sized him up, she took a moment to note her proximity to the stable. If she could simply outrun him, she could reach the relative safety of the public space, counting on him not to be so brazen as to attack her in such a public place.
To give herself a headstart, she thrust the tip of the umbrella, as hard as she could manage, straight into his foot. He grunted in surprise, but she did not let up.
She deftly brought the umbrella up toward his chin, striking with the umbrella’s wooden handle. He let out a groan of pain, and she took off running.
She felt one of his hands grasping at her shoulder, but she shrugged him off and fled past him. Barely even looking where she was going, she ran, navigating between the pairs of trees that blocked her way.
She spared a quick glance behind her, and saw that the gargantuan thug was still right behind her. She pushed past another enormous oak, and ran straight into the grasping arms of his accomplice.
The second man grabbed her with a viselike grip, and Miss Monday gasped in surprise. This second man must have been the giant’s accomplice, the relatively smaller, agile gentleman who’d disappeared in a flash when she’d been about to surprise him with an umbrella to the face. She squirmed, but his grasp was tight.</Text>

            <Text>Roderick Steen

	Role in Story:	Protagonist In Subplot
	Occupation:	Private Investigator
 	

Physical Description:	Blonde, blue-eyed, and brightly if not tastefully dressed, with silk ascots and colourful trousers, Roderick has curly hair and a carefully groomed moustache. He has a tattoo on his right foot, which he claims while in disguise as a sailor—for a case, he says—though in reality there was no case…just a rather handsome sailor.

Personality:		Roderick Steen is an eccentric but brilliant dandy, often annoyed by being compared to Sherlock Holmes. “Somehow I failed to catch the homoerotic subtext in the Hounds of the Baskervilles.” Roderick is a homosexual, a fact he hides only just barely and only from those he feels might be inclined to have him arrested. Otherwise, he is quite proud of his sexual deviancy. His constant companion, with whom he regularly converses, is a dog named Bailey, the Watson to his Holmes.

Habits/Mannerisms:	As mentioned, he often talks to his dog, doing the voice of Bailey with a bit of ill-practiced ventriloquism. He has an excessive sweet tooth and often walks around barefoot. He does not drink or smoke, another glaring difference from him and the fictional Holmes.
 	

Background:		It would hardly have surprised anyone if Mr. Steen were to claim that vampires were real. If anything, it is his scepticism that is surprising. Most people believe in them, do they not? Ghosts, vampires, werewolves. What reason does anyone have to doubt their existence? Really, it is only the upper classes and the highly educated that refuse to believe in such things, and Roderick is middle class at best.  His father had been a policeman, and an alcoholic. Edward Steen had made a decent salary as a detective at Scotland Yard, in spite of his inability to refuse a glass of whiskey when one was proffered. If Edward Steen was alive to this day, Roderick Steen did not know, nor care. He had distanced himself from his father in every way he possibly could.

            <Text>“Your mother didn’t want me to tell you,” said Abraham Palmer.
“My mother? What has she got to do with this?” asked Jonathan.
“I think you have the right to know,” he said, “And anyway, you’d have figured it out on your own eventually. I’m surprised how much you’ve already learned. You were right, by the way, about the zombies. But what you don’t know is that there were zombies in this city even before the Resurrectionists spread their plague. Not in these vast numbers, mind you. Just the odd incident, here and there. We would hear stories of a man staggering down the streets, sick, out of his mind. Usually an attack of some sort would take place, someone might end up bitten. We would investigate. We would track down the zombie, quarantine those who came into contact with him to prevent the virus from spreading. And in the papers, we would make up a story. Drugs, alcohol, madness, that sort of thing.”
“Why lie?”
“Because the Lazarus Virus is dangerous. Your father believed that if the disease ever fell into the wrong hands, it could be used as a weapon.”
Jonathan thought of what Parson Sinews had told him. Anthony Tidkins had received military funding to study the Lazarus Virus. Evidently Charles Grimmer’s fears were not misplaced.
“Our efforts were largely effective, although we lost good men over the years in encounters with the zombies. We quickly learned that we were not well equipped to deal with the zombies when there was so much we didn’t know about the virus. How it worked, how it spread, how quickly it could kill its victims and how quickly bring them back, what were the signs and symptoms of infection, how intelligent and how agile were the infected. We needed a place to study the virus. We built a laboratory, keeping its location a closely guarded secret known only to those few of us who hunted the infected,” Palmer continued.
Jonathan followed what he was saying, as if listening to a conversation in a dream. Palmer’s words made sense, but what he was saying made no sense.
“Of course, what we didn’t know is that while we had gone to great lengths to keep the zombie virus a secret, Anthony Tidkins already knew about it. After your father…” Palmer continued, and trailed off uncomfortably. After an awkward pause, he continued. “Well, the Resurrectionists learned about our laboratory, and decided to use it for themselves. We agreed to let them use it, under the pretence that we shared their goals. We’ve been working to undermine their goals from the inside.”
Jonathan scoffed.
“Well, great job,” he said with unrestrained sarcasm. “Seems to be going very well so far, your efforts.”
He stood up. He couldn’t sit still and listen to this any longer. Abe Palmer, a man Jonathan had known since he was a child, his mentor at the Grimmer Company, a man Jonathan practically thought of as an uncle, actually secretly hunted zombies with his father, and had invited the Resurrectionists to use their secret laboratory. He felt laughter welling up inside, and bit back the urge to let it out. He worried that once he started laughing, he wouldn’t be able to stop. He knew that he was being hysterical, but really, was he supposed to just accept what Palmer was telling him?
At last, he sat back down, shaking his head. He let out a single, bitter laugh, and looked up into Palmer’s eyes. As incredible as this all sounded, he knew that Palmer wasn’t joking. A minute passed in uncomfortable silence. Palmer sat patiently.
“So,” he said eventually. “My mother?”
Palmer nodded. “Yes. She didn’t hunt zombies herself, but she supported our efforts.”
“And your story about Anthony Tidkins…” Jonathan asked, but he was beginning to think he already knew the answer.
Palmer nodded again. “Yes,” he said, “I heard the story from Tidkins’ own mouth.”</Text>

            <Title>Prologue</Title>
            <Comments>Notes:

1. Miss Monday manages to get away from Connor’s without handing over the item. She visits the Melbourne Club in order to question him about selling her out, which is when she finds him dead. Later, she discovers the package has been stolen from her home, where she’s hidden it.

2. Mr. O is already friends with Roderick Steen. This is how he learns about the Vigilance Committee meeting, which Roderick had planned to attend himself (due to his interest in solving the Dr. Allen case). It’s when Mr. O shows up at Roderick’s to ask for help that Roderick is alerted to Lord Henry’s death.

3. Miss Monday visits the grimmer company while Mr. O is absent. His secretary lets him know that a lady dropped by, and left an address where she could be found.

4. He then meets Miss Monday for tea. They discuss their mutual findings, and make arrangements to meet again later.

5. Charles Grimmer, Jonathan’s father, was murdered by Resurrectionists. Perhaps, according to the police, the cause of death was accidental.

6. The villains’ plot:
- Jack Bernhardt/Anthony Tidkins is researching Lazarus (trying to cure immortality).
- Jack is using a serum to brainwash other scientists (…? Could feasibly remove this aspect)
- Dr. Allen, Jack’s mentor, was researching Lazarus. When Jack discovered Lazarus, he ruined Allen’s reputation by committing a series of murders and making it look like Allen’s work. Allen, now a fugitive, was forced to accept Jack’s “help,” and went into hiding among the Resurrectionists.
- Get rid of the “diorama” aspect of Dr. Allen’s murders
- Get rid of “Dr. Allen” as the villain name; change to Anthony Tidkins

7. How does The Shadow fit in:
originally,
- Charles Grimmer was trying to eliminate the zombie threat, in secret. He had a secret, underground facility dedicated to the cause. Mrs. Grimmer has been working against the zombie threat as well, as a member of the Shadow.
Change this, so
- Charles and Mrs. Grimmer know about the zombies and the Resurrectionists’ plot. They have been trying to infiltrate the Resurrectionists from within. They believe they have an “inside man” (Abraham Palmer), but it is their trust in Palmer that leads to Charles’ death and the Resurrectionists’ eventual success in spreading Lazarus.</Comments>

            <Title>Scene 6</Title>
            <Synopsis>
“You’re stealing from him?” said Mr. O. “That’s why you came here? What does he have in there that was worth killing for?”
Annabel shook her head.
“I don’t know,” she said. “I only know how much it’s worth. I have a buyer, and they’re willing to pay handsomely for whatever it is.”
“Can’t be anything good. Connor was a Resurrectionist,” said Mr. O.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Annabel stooped down to get another look at Lord Connor. She needed to roll him onto his back to do so, and he was heavy. Damn heavy. She huffed with the effort as she heaved him onto his back. His head rolled, giving her a clear view of the exit wound at the back of his skull.
She turned his head until he was looking at her. She almost recoiled. His face was a vision of horror.
“Was he always this ugly?” she muttered.
He was in his sixties, Annabel guessed. His face was whiskered, and his white hair was stained with blood. His skin was mottled and grey, and in places, it was cracked and blemished. His eyes were white. His nose was broken where she’d kicked him, and there was an exit wound in the back of his skull. She shuddered and stepped back. She hated that she was so disturbed by dead bodies. Not for the first time, she wished she was more ruthless.
Connor would be difficult to move. She wondered if Mr. O had any ideas.
“We could just leave him here,” she mused. “You said you had an escape plan?”
“I do,” he told her, “But first I need to know…why did you kill him?” After a pause, he added, “Did someone hire you?”
Annabel took a moment to reach under Connor’s desk to retrieve her revolver. She slipped it back into her gun belt and withdrew a spare bullet for her derringer. She reloaded the gun and holstered it.
“That thing only takes one bullet?” he asked, watching her.
She nodded.
Annabel considered her ally by circumstance. She noticed for the first time how tall he was, and how broad-shouldered. If he’d been a fighter, he could easily have overpowered her, wrestled the gun from her hand, and regained control. The fact that he hadn’t tried that suggested that he wasn’t a fighter. He’d mentioned that he hunted, which meant he knew how to fire a gun; luckily for her, the derringer was not a hunting weapon.
“So, when you were pointing that thing at me, it was empty?”
“It was,” she admitted. “Listen, I’ll make you a deal. You get me out of here and I’ll tell you what you want to know about Connor.”
Mr. O seemed to consider her offer, then gave her a nod.
“I need you on lookout,” she said. “Let me know if anyone’s coming. There’s something I need to do before we can leave.”
As he stood at the door, Annabel reached under Connor’s desk to retrieve her revolver. She slipped it back into her gun belt and stood. Then she took out her lock-picking kit. Just because Connor was dead didn’t mean he couldn’t still be robbed. She spared her new accomplice one last glance. She wondered if she could trust him not to run off as soon as her back was turned.
She turned away and made her way over to the safe. This would be much more difficult now that she could no longer demand the safe’s combination from its owner. But she set to work cracking it.
“There was something wrong with him. He was sick,” she said, as she fiddled with the lock.
“Hm?” said Mr. O, who was standing at the door, true to his word.
“Lord Connor. I didn’t come here to kill him. He was sick. Deranged. He came at me. I had to put him down. It was self-defense.”
She put a hand to her lips. She needed to listen for the click of the lock as she slowly turned it. Then it clicked. She made a mental note of the number, then began to turn the dial the opposite way.
“Sick how?” Mr. O asked. “Consumption? Ergotism?”
Annabel looked up from her work. “Something else, I think. He was trying to eat me,” she offered by way of example.
“He what?” Mr. O exclaimed.
“Well, look at him. He’s far too rotten given he’s only been dead a few minutes. Clearly there was something wrong with him. Anyway, this really isn’t the time. Is anyone coming? This is taking longer than I’d hoped.”
“Still clear,” he said.
Annabel had to remind herself to breathe. It was easy to get lost in her work. That was why she wanted a lookout. She couldn’t afford to be listening for approaching footsteps when she was intent on hearing the click of the mechanical components of the lock. She needed only one more number, and she nearly had it.
“I think someone’s coming,” Mr. O said suddenly.
“Almost…” she said, ignoring him. She really was almost there, if she could just get that one last number. She continued to work the lock, listening for the tell-tale sound of the lock sliding into place.
“We’ve got to go,” he whispered urgently.
Cursing, she looked up from her work. Mr. O had shut the door and had his ear pressed against it, listening for the approaching footsteps of whoever was coming. She watched in silence, holding her breath as Mr. O tensed.
A minute passed in silence as they waited for the door to burst open on them. Again, she drew her Derringer. She aimed it at the doorway, even as she willed the door not to open. So far, this had gone exactly how she didn’t want it to go. She began to ask if the coast was clear, but Mr. O shushed her.
Another minute passed. She could hear floorboards creaking outside the door, even over the sound of the music from downstairs. Finally, Mr. O took a deep breath and turned back to her, relief clearly written on his face.
 “False alarm, I suppose,” he said. “They must have gone into the other room. Still, someone is bound to have noticed Connor’s absence by now. We can’t afford to linger any longer than we already have.”
Annabel had to agree. Still, she wasn’t leaving until she had what she’d come here for. She didn’t bother saying so aloud; she simply returned her attention to cracking the safe. Annabel swiveled the dial, more quickly now. At last, it slid into the correct position. She heard the satisfying click announcing that she’d gotten it. To the untrained ear, the sound would have been easily missed, but Annabel was an expert. “Got it.”
She pulled the door open and hastily withdrew a thick, yellow envelope. She got to her feet and stealthily made her way to Mr. O. She realized she was grinning, and she felt that flush of excitement she always felt when she’d retrieved an item of value. O was looking at her impatiently, but she couldn’t help but notice how blue his eyes were. A woman could get lost in those eyes.
Smiling as she handled the envelope from Connor’s safe, she forced herself to focus.
“So, how do we get out of here?”
He held up a finger, as if to say hold that thought, and made his way to the window, drew aside the curtains, and opened the latch. A cool breeze drifted into the room, causing the curtains to ripple like waves and the paper on Connor’s desk to dance. Annabel could hear the lilting voices of ladies and deep baritone laughs of gentlemen from somewhere below.
 In the yard, just a few feet from the window, an airship was secured to a tree. It was elegant and sleek in design, with propellors of polished brass mounted along its enormous length, with sails beneath its gondola. She could only see a portion of it, from their present angle, such was its size.
“Are you insane?” said Annabel, looking at her newfound companion in astonishment. “This vessel is yours?”
“I like to travel in style,” he replied, looking out at the airship, seeming not to have noticed her tone.
“Have you no concept whatsoever of the word clandestine? The idea is to avoid attention, not draw it. Are you honestly suggesting we throw Connor’s body in your dirigible and just fly away? You don’t think anyone might notice?”
He shrugged. Annabel crossed her arms and tapped her foot.
“Well, yes, I’ve always found the airship draws a bit more attention than I’d care for. To be honest, I hardly ever use it. It does seem a lucky coincidence that it’s parked just outside the window, though, doesn’t it? When weighed against the option of dragging Connor’s body downstairs, through the ballroom, and out the front door, hoping nobody will notice, flying him away in a conveniently located airship doesn’t seem like such an absurd option, does it?”
Annabel snorted. Well, when he put it that way, the plan wasn’t as idiotic as it seemed upon further consideration, but still, the airship was certain to draw attention.
“Fine,” he said at last, “Then I suppose you’ve got a better idea?”
“As I said earlier, suppose we leave the body here? Certainly he’ll be discovered eventually, but so long as we aren’t found with the body, that’s still better than being seen removing the body.”
“Hm. One small problem with that solution. What happens when the body is discovered and the police start asking questions?”
“Nothing will happen. No one saw you heading upstairs, did they?”
Mr. O awarded her question with a contrite expression and a shrug of his shoulders.
“Oh, god,” she said. “You really do have no idea how to be discrete, do you? Well, I’m afraid that’s your problem. You can feel free to fly away in your little airship; take Connor with you if you feel so inclined. I couldn’t care less, so long as I’m not on that airship with you. I intend to leave the way I came in. Through the front door.”
“I thought we were in this together,” he protested, using her own turn of phrase.
“That was when I needed you as a lookout,” she retorted. She almost felt a bit guilty, but she reminded herself that she didn’t owe this man anything. He’d done little but slow her down and get in the way. “Do yourself a favor. When the police do come knocking at your door, don’t mention my name.”
She paused. Her shirt was stained with Connor’s blood.
“I need your jacket, by the way,” she said.
Mr. O snorted. “You want my trousers too? While you’re at it, how about my dignity?”
“Don’t tempt me,” Annabel replied. “I am a thief, remember.”
She stood at the door, ready to leave. Before she did, she handed him back his gun. It was the least she could do.</Text>
            <Comments>Does this mean she can see the names on the ship? Has Mr. O given himself away?
A close range shot, even into the mouth, and, especially one that 
exits the head, will produce a rather incredible blood splatter, double 
especially if she was laying under him when the shot occurred.  Exiting 
through the front door, with blood splattered clothing, may attract even
 more attention than leaving via an airship.

            <Notes>Annabel took a moment to consider her ally by circumstance. She noticed for the first time how tall he was, and how broad-shouldered. If he’d been a fighter, he could easily have overpowered her, wrestled the gun from her hand, and regained control. The fact that he hadn’t tried that suggested that he wasn’t a fighter. But he was perceptive, she thought. And he was either very bold or very arrogant. She wasn’t sure which, but if he really thought she was a killer and was still trying to interrogate her, he had to be one or the other.
“I’ll make you a deal,” she said. “You get me out of here and I’ll tell you everything.”
Mr. O seemed to consider her offer, then gave her a nod.

            <Title>Scene 2</Title>
            <Text>Annabel let out a cry of alarm. Annabel wasn't the screaming type, but she was on the verge. Her eyes were wide. Her heart was hammering, and she suddenly found that it was a struggle just to suck in a breath of air. Of course, it couldn’t have helped much that her breasts were bound in cloth as part of her disguise; she was wrapped up tighter than a pharaoh in his tomb, and every breath was painful.
She reminded herself that she’d been in spots tighter than this. She told herself to remain calm, but the darkness was oppressive. She kept flashing back to the day she’d lost her eye. She could almost feel Connor's rough fingernails raking across her face, digging into her flesh, gouging out her eye. Silly woman, she scolded herself. She gritted her teeth. She’d survived that day. She would survive this one too.
She took a deep breath, reached up, and adjusted a dial on her eyepiece. The world through her right eye took on a greenish hue, but she could see again. Not well, but well enough to see Connor. He was right on top of her, inches from her face. She gasped in surprise. He was closer than she'd realized.
She’d lost her gun, but she had another one. Trouble was, it wasn’t easily accessible, and she wasn’t sure she’d be able to fish it out before Connor could sink his teeth into her flesh, which is what he seemed to be trying to do. She needed to get out of his grasp, just long enough to get it.
Forcing herself to remain calm, she dug her heels into the carpet for leverage and shoved hard, sliding on her back across the floor. She reached out, above her head, and grasped for something to hit him with. Eventually, her hands collided with something thick, solid, and…wooden. It was one of the legs of the desk. It wasn’t a weapon, but, at least, it was something. She held tight and used it to leverage herself toward the desk, kicking at Connor’s face as she scrambled to get away.
She was relentless, and eventually, one of her kicks struck him hard enough to do some damage. Connor's head snapped back violently, and he toppled backward. But before she had gained any ground, he seized hold of her leg and began crawling back towards her face once more.
She pulled hard on the leg of the desk, trying to drag herself further back, but this time, she only succeeded in moving the desk. She growled in frustration and tried to pull herself out from under him. It was futile. She could barely even move with him on top of her.
What she needed, she considered, was a weapon. Something, anything to hit him with, just to get him off of her long enough to retrieve her gun. She looked around for something within reach.
There. She could see the slightest hint of light beneath the desk. A glint of silver. It was her revolver. She could have cried with relief. Urgently, she reached out, stretching her fingers in a desperate plea to grab the gun.
She could almost touch it. Almost, but not quite. She tried to stretch out further, grasping desperately as she pressed her face against the side of the desk just to get a bit closer. She reached her arm out until she was sure that she would tear it from its socket before she managed to grab hold of the revolver. She felt her fingers just brushing up against the handle of the gun. Almost, almost…she thought. And then she slipped, and the gun slid even further out of reach.
No, she nearly cried aloud, as if she could somehow will the gun back to her. For the first time, she realized she might actually die here. She might die with the gun just out of her reach, another one nestled in its holster, inaccessible with the deranged, sickened Connor atop her.
Connor growled, his voice barely recognizable as human, and she felt certain that he would eat her alive if he could.
"This is not how I die," she grunted. It was all she could do to remind herself that she would get through this. She was a survivor. She’d grown up on the fierce streets of London, a dirty, scrawny orphan with nothing to her name but the will to live. She would not die like this.
She squirmed. Finally, she managed to get a leg free. She kicked him hard in the face. She was rewarded with the brutal sound of Connor’s nose shattering. The air filled with the tangy, metallic scent of blood. She kicked him again, dislodging a few yellowing teeth. Still, his grip would not relent.
She thrashed, urgently trying to shake him from her. Her heart beat so hard within her chest it was painful, especially with her chest bound so tightly. Her breath came out in short, quick gasps. Somehow, she managed to maintain some semblance of calm, or, at least, the will to survive.
She gritted her teeth. The only thing for it was to shoot the bastard, but the gun was beyond her grasp. She still had her second gun, though, a pocket-sized Derringer. Not exactly her style, but she couldn’t be too choosy. If she could just get at it, it would do the trick.
Even as Connor tried to tear her face off with his teeth, Annabel reached into her belt, fending him off with her other hand. Finally, she managed to find the pistol. 
Connor’s jaws gnashed. She drew the weapon and aimed it at him. He seemed not to notice. He snapped at her fingers, dripping spit onto her chest.
She cringed.
But she felt more like herself again with the gun in hand. Almost calmly, she stuck the pistol straight into his mouth. She angled it upward, just slightly, so that it was aimed directly at his brain. Then she waited. One second. Two seconds. As patiently as she could.
Against all common sense, despite the gun in his mouth, Connor was still trying to reach her, his putrid breath making Annabel gag. His hands groped the side of her face, and she twisted her neck to avoid being scratched by his yellowing fingernails.
She felt his cold, dry hands against her skin, but she willed herself to wait, just a moment longer. The music was beginning to wind down. The song was in its last few measures.
Finally, the moment arrived. The waltz had finished. A chorus of applause broke out. She hoped it would be enough to drown out the gunshot. She shut her eye, turned her head away, and pulled the trigger.
The bullet whipped through Connor’s skull, taking huge chunks of brain matter with it. Cold, thick blood exploded. It spattered across her face and chest.
A chorus of applause broke out, and Annabel had the momentary sensation that it was her work that was being appreciated.
Connor’s body went limp and landed, hard, against Annabel’s chest. She grimaced with distaste, but she was relieved it was over. She took a moment to try to wipe the blood from her face.
The applause began to subside and eventually gave way to silence. In the quiet moments that followed the gunshot, she heard the click of a latch and the creak of hinges. Someone had opened the door.</Text>
            <Comments>Again, good build on the character description as the story continues on.

much as I love breasts, the description would probably work better as 'that her chest was bound as part of her disguise' as it's a clearer link to why she can't breath freely
This is good, but build up more suspense.  Once she realizes that the desk isn’t heavy enough to be used to pull herself up with, what does she do?
How did she feel or what was she thinking when she realized what she was/is looking at?  I am imagining a lot of hope and urgency to get it back into her hands.

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>Perhaps his paranoia was born out of habit, a result of his unusual choice of career. Then again, perhaps it was not paranoia at all. Perhaps it was intuition. Whatever it was, Charles Grimmer believed he was being followed.
The weather was cold, as it often was in London, but at least it was not raining. The evening was overcast, gloomy, and dark, but Charles had dressed sensibly, with a riding jacket and scarf. He carried an umbrella, just in case the weather were to change without warning. He’d worn a pair of his finest and warmest gloves, and woollen trousers that could be worn amongst London’s elite but which would also keep him warm.
He set off to hail a cab, concerned that his private coach might be recognized. He flagged down an approaching hansom and when it stopped, climbed in.
He gave the directions to his driver, who gave him a curt nod. He urged the horse onward with a crack of the whip, and they were on their way. The horse’s gait was quick and musical as it clopped along the cobblestone. The little carriage rattled as it rolled along the street toward the Printing Company.
“Can we go any faster?” he asked the driver.
The driver responded with another crack of the whip, which spurred the horse on to a quicker pace. He watched as the driver of the carriage in question cracked his own whip and urged his own horse to pick up speed.
“Right,” he said, “Turn right here.”
“But Sir,” said the driver.
“Hard right,” he insisted, though Grimmer and Sons was in the opposite direction.
The driver shrugged and made the turn. They tore around the corner, taking the turn roughly. The cab bounced hard on the pavement. It rattled and lurched as they sped around the curve, but the driver managed to keep the vehicle upright. Charles tossed him an extra coin for his troubles, and he grunted in reply, urging the horse to even greater speed.
“Left here,” he said, craning his neck to watch as the other carriage pursued them still, taking the corner with reckless abandon.
There was no longer any doubt that he was being followed. His heart hammering, he withdrew a notepad and pen. Being the owner of a number of newspapers and a printing company, he had taken to carrying a pen and paper in his pockets at all times. His hands were constantly stained with ink, much to Mrs. Grimmer’s chagrin. He began writing furiously, dabbing his pen in his ink pad.
They took the next corner with even greater speed than the first, so that they nearly collided with the cab in front of them. A line streaked across the paper, a blotch of ink soaking through the pages.
The driver steered around the other vehicle, taking the wrong side of the street in order to pass it. Charles tossed him a sovereign and directed him to hang a left.
He did as commanded, but the coach responded in kind, matching their every move. He patted his side and took comfort in the slight revolver-shaped bulge that he felt there.
“Take the next right,” he instructed, “Don’t slow down.”
They took the corner at breakneck speed. The cab threatened to roll over. Charles Grimmer braced himself for a fall. He heard the thunder of galloping hooves, and felt the carriage roll up onto one wheel.
“Hold on, Sir,” said the driver.
At last, the driver managed to get the hansom back under control. Its second wheel touched back down again, and they were off.
“Keep going,” he urged, though his heart was thundering just as quick as the stallion in front of them.
He turned around in his seat, but he could hardly see a thing from where he sat. He stuck his head out the window, and a bullet whizzed past his head. He cursed and pulled his head back inside.
“Next right,” he called, thinking he’d lose his pursuers here, in Hyde Park.
The bright expanse of green and fragrant flower gardens by day was transformed by night into a black field with creeping vines and the strange nocturnal cries of birds of prey.
“Keep driving,” Charles instructed. “Act as though nothing has happened.”
He tore out the page from his notebook, handed it to the driver.
“One last thing. I need you to deliver this letter. It is of the utmost importance. Will you do that for me?”
Perhaps the man saw the desperation in his eyes, or perhaps he was just a kind, generous soul. He gave a nod and promised to see the letter delivered.
Without further warning, Charles flung open the door and tumbled onto the dark green. He rolled across the grass, the wind knocked out of him. He lay flat, keeping his eyes to the ground, and watched as the other cab continued to follow the hansom. With any luck, they hadn’t seen him leave the cab. He could lose them here.
The carriage rolled to a stop. Its doors swung open, and its passengers stepped out of the cab. The first man out of the carriage began making his way directly toward Charles.
Charles got to his feet, hurrying to hide himself amongst a copse of tall trees. It was dark and quiet beneath the thick canopy of the trees, the silence penetrated by occasional hoot of an owl. He pressed his back against the back of a tall tree. He held his breath and listened for his pursuers.
He heard the crunch of leaves beneath a man’s foot. A single footstep that betrayed his location.
He waited, counting out the few footsteps that followed the first one. Finally, when he was undoubtedly within striking distance, he came out quite literally swinging. He brandished his umbrella as a weapon, hoping to catch the man off guard. But the man was gone.
Suddenly there came the crack of a twig from behind him. He swung around and found himself face to face with a man nearly twice his size. Standing at nearly eight feet tall, his opponent wore a hooded cloak and the black, leather mask of a plague doctor. Despite the mask, there was of course no doubt as to the man’s identity.
“The Irish Giant,” Charles breathed in terror.
Dr. Allen must not be far behind, he realised. The Giant was fearsome, but he was simply the muscle. The real threat was the doctor. He would have sent the Giant ahead to collect Charles, and to bring him to the laboratory where the doctor conducted his experiments.
As he sized the man up, he took a moment to note his surroundings, consider a possible escape route. If he could simply outrun the man, he might still survive this.
To give himself a headstart, he thrust the tip of the umbrella as hard as he could manage straight into the brute’s foot. He grunted in surprise but made no other reaction.
Charles deftly brought the umbrella up toward the man’s chin, striking with the umbrella’s wooden handle. The Giant let out a groan of pain, and Charles took off running.
He felt an enormous hand seize him by the neck and haul him back. He choked as his feet lifted off the ground, the Giant’s strong hands crushing his windpipe. The Giant moved his hands to grab Charles by the legs and shoulders, and Charles gasped for air, kicking his legs furiously.
The Giant grabbed Charles tighter, holding him against his own chest, like a destitute mother smothering her child. Charles could no longer even struggle.
“I’ve got him,” said the Irish Giant, turning so Charles could see the doctor, masked like his assailant.
“Well done, Mr. Hyde,” said the doctor.
Charles was beginning to lose consciousness, the giant was squeezing the air out of him, like a boa constrictor crushing its prey. His face had gone blue, his breaths were shallow. He felt his ribs crack. He thought dimly of a woman. Not Mrs. Grimmer, but someone else. There had been another woman in his life, when he was a much younger man. It had been so long since he’d thought of her, but now she was all that he could think of. She would be his final thought.</Text>

            <Title>Scene One</Title>
            <Text>Both of Annabel’s eyes were working. She’d half expected to have had her prosthesis removed by her captors, so it came as a profound relief, upon waking, that her vision was still entirely intact. She unstrapped the device, took the key from around her neck, and used it to wind up the mechanical eye. Before replacing it in its socket, she flipped open the hidden compartment. She had to suppress a grin. The poison dart was still there.
So, an eye for an eye, she thought. She’d put a dart in Mrs. Grimmer’s neck as soon as she had a chance, see how the bitch liked it. She had to wonder, though. Jonathan had said that Mrs. Grimmer was working against the Resurrectionists from the inside. It was still possible that she was on their side. Still, she had no idea how far Mrs. Grimmer would go to maintain her cover. Surely she’d protect her son, but Annabel doubted the same courtesy would be extended to her.
She flipped the compartment shut and clicked her eye back in place with a click and a pneumatic hiss. There was an uncomfortable pressure in her skull as she fit the device into its socket, but she’d grown used to that over the years. As used to it as one could get anyway. She felt naked without the eye strapped in. Quickly, she fastened the straps, and experimentally rotated the lens.
She jumped back. There was someone in the cell next to her. A dark, shadowy figure in the blackness of the holding cell. He was watching her intently. Annabel shrunk away, squinting with her mechanical eye until it changed focus to reveal the man more clearly. She reached up and adjusted a dial. There was a hiss of gas, and the device began to emit a light. She turned another knob, which allowed her to see more sharply in the dim lighting. As she turned the wheel, she could finally see him clearly.
He was astonishingly handsome, an unsettling smile upon his lips. A sardonic expression on his unblemished, youthful face. A piercing gaze in his eyes. His eyes looked bright yellow, but it might have been a trick of the light or a deficiency with her prosthesis.
“Sorry if I startled you,” he said.
“Not at all,” Annabel lied. She got to her feet and moved over to get a better look at him. Easier than squinting through her prosthetic eye.
“What is this place?” he asked.
She shook her head. She’d been hoping he could tell her.
“Resurrectionist holding cell, I believe,” she said.
She remembered the events before losing consciousness, remembered the conversation that took place as she stared off into space and into Mr. O’s eyes, but the details were hazy.
“They mentioned another prisoner,” she said. “They said they were going to send us to Chateau d’If.”
“A code name for a prison, I imagine” he told her. The man possessed Annabel’s own ability to appear remarkably calm despite the duress of an unusual situation. She wondered if he felt as apprehensive as she did, in spite of his cool demeanour.
“Chateau d’If is the name of a fortress in the Mediterranean Sea, near the Old Port of Marseille, which later became a prison. It was used in Alexandre Dumas’ novel, The Count of Monte Cristo, as the apparently inescapable secret prison from which Edmond Dantes eventually escapes. Unless we’re being escorted there in reality, which I doubt, I’d wager that Chateau d’If is being used as a code name for some other prison.”
His eyes never left her as he spoke.
“What do you know of these Resurrectionists?” he asked, suddenly changing the subject.
“I’m not sure I want to tell you,” she said, equally cold. “Who are you? What do they want with you?”
He edged closer to the end of his cell, and put his hands on the bars. The yellow glow in his eyes was even more pronounced with him standing close enough to touch her.
“I’m a hobbyist,” he said.
“A hobbyist?” she repeated dully. “Of what sort?”
“I follow the careers of dangerous criminals, collect broadsides and memorabilia, and visit the sites of their crimes.”
“An odd hobby.”
“But a popular one, believe it or not,” he countered. He placed his head against the bars. It seemed an effort to get closer to her. She took a cautious step backwards, and he grinned.
“I’m also the founder of a Vigilance Committee,” he said, “Which may be why they’ve brought me here. I must have uncovered something, some secret of theirs that they didn’t like me knowing.”
“You’re Parson Sinews,” Annabel said with surprise.
“You’ve heard of me?”
He laughed. It was a cold sound, without mirth, and it unsettled her.
Mr. O had said that he’d seen Mr. Sinews being placed under arrest by the police. Why then, was he in the Resurrectionists’ facility, and not in a regular prison? There were two possibilities that Annabel could think of. First, the Resurrectionists had impersonated the police in order to spirit him away. Second, there were Resurrectionists within Scotland Yard’s ranks.
“We share a mutual acquaintance,” she said. “Mr. O.”
“Ah,” he said with a smile. “The young Jonathan Grimmer.”
“Does everyone know poor Mr. Grimmer’s identity?” said Annabel. “Alas, I don’t believe Mr. Grimmer is well suited for the cloak and dagger.”
“No indeed,” Mr. Sinews agreed. “Then again, it seems that you and I are not as adept at the clandestine as we’d like to think either, given our current circumstances. Nevertheless, the three of us are wrapped up in this whether we like it or not.”
“And do you like it?” Annabel wanted to know.
She hadn’t really trusted Mr. O, but she’d liked the man well enough. She trusted Mr. Sinews even less, and she didn’t think she particularly liked him either. But she was trapped in a cell, and he was interesting if not likeable. And somehow, despite his imprisonment, he seemed to be enjoying himself.
“In this cage? No, I’m afraid I’m not enjoying myself much any longer. That said, it is a pleasant surprise meeting you here. I never thought I’d have the opportunity to thank you in person. The Rembrandt is exquisite. I’ve set it on the wall in my sitting room, adjacent to the fireplace.”
It took some amount of effort for Annabel to keep a neutral expression. She remembered that particular heist well enough. As was her usual method, she’d made the arrangements through third parties, keeping the identity of her clients and her own name anonymous. She never met her clients personally, never learned their names. Using the alias Monday was a failsafe. She was a ghost. She should be untraceable. And she hadn’t introduced herself to Mr. Sinews. Seeing that he’d deduced it meant that either he was particularly clever or that her cover had again been blown by one of her sources. Until recently, she would have considered the latter impossible. Now, she was not so sure.
“I’m glad to hear that, Mr. Sinews, but let’s keep the conversation to the Resurrectionists,” she said.
She wanted to say more, but she bit her lip. Sinews smiled that infuriating smile of his and shrunk back from the bars of his cell, and took a seat on the cot.
“Very well,” he said, threading his fingers together on his lap. “What have you and our boy detective learned about them? I imagine he’s already told you about my theories?”
“Yes,” Annabel told him. “In fact, Mr. Grimmer and I had an opportunity to interview Dr. Allen. As it turns out, you were right, at least to some extent. Dr. Allen committed his crimes under the influence of a behavioural modification serum that had apparently gone wrong. Dr. Allen is no longer suffering the effects of the serum; he’s no longer a threat.”
Parson barely blinked at the revelation. But he was no longer smiling.
“Jack,” she said. “Jack is the real threat.”
“Jack who?”
“Bernhardt,” she said, though neither Dr. Simms nor Dr. Allen had provided a surname. “Otherwise known as Anthony Tidkins.”
“I’ve never heard of him.”
“Few have,” Annabel replied. But if he was expecting her to tell him, he was to be disappointed. She changed the subject. “What do you know of the Lazarus Virus?”
“Once again, Miss Monday, you have me at a disadvantage.”
The name was used as a dig, a reminder that while Annabel knew about Anthony and the Lazarus Virus, he knew about her. She was tempted not to save her poisoned dart for Mrs. Grimmer’s throat. But she kept her anger in check. At least he didn’t know her as Annabel.
So she gave him a quick explanation of the virus, based on what Dr. Simms had told her about it and the creature she’d seen floating in the tank. She told him how the serum had apparently been used to influence the behaviour of Jack’s fellow Resurrectionists. She told him about Mrs. Grimmer, who was, according to Dr. Allen, not under the influence of the neurotoxin. She decided not to tell him that there was a possibility that Mrs. Grimmer was actually on their side.
“Well, at least one of my theories holds true,” he said when she’d finished explaining. “I did predict the behaviour-altering drugs. But I believed that it was Dr. Allen who’d invented the serum. He was conducting research on the zombies of Haiti. I believed that’s where he discovered the possibilities of that concoction.”
“That was Jack,” Annabel told him.
Sinews frowned.
“I disagree,” he said stubbornly, but he offered no explanation. Then his attention turned elsewhere. “Quiet, someone’s coming.”
Annabel nodded. Without a word, she collapsed on the floor, where she lay motionless. A moment later, someone rounded the corner. An unfamiliar voice, two sets of footsteps.
“This is the prisoner?”
“That’s her.” The second voice belonged to Dr. Simms.
“Good, she’s still unconscious. Should be easy enough to get a sample.”
Annabel heard the sound of a key being pushed into a lock, a sound with which she was intimately familiar. The lock clicked, and the door opened.
“Be careful,” said Dr. Simms. “She may not be unconscious; she may be dead. Which means she could wake up at any moment, infected with Lazarus, if she’s not immune.”
Annabel kept her eyes shut, and listened as the footsteps crossed the room. She felt the man leaning over her, endured his hands on her side as he reached down and pricked her neck with the needle of the syringe. She waited a moment while he extracted her blood.
When he pulled the needle out, she attacked, startling him with a head-butt, breaking his nose. She blinked forcefully with her mechanical eye, and the dart shot out. Only a moment later, he slumped forward, dropping the blood-filled syringe to the floor.
She squirmed her way out from beneath his unconscious body, picked up the syringe, and scurried out of her cell, going straight for Dr. Simms. The man yelped and turned to flee, but Annabel was much quicker. She seized him by the throat and thrust the syringe into his neck. Suddenly he became very still.
“So, you want my blood, do you?”
“No,” he whimpered. “No, please no. You could be infected.”
“Explain.”
“At Lord Connor’s masquerade, you were exposed to the Lazarus Virus as it was spread in vapour form.”
“The perfume?” she asked.
He whimpered a yes and continued to explain.
“We weren’t entirely certain of your exposure to the airborne contagion, which was why the dart that rendered you unconscious was contaminated by the virus.”
“So,” she replied, somehow managing to remain calm. “My blood is infected with the Lazarus Virus? In that case, if you know what’s good for you, you’ll tell me what I want to know.”
From his cell, Parson Sinews quietly applauded.
“Bravo, Miss Monday.” he said. “I find I am enjoying myself after all.”
Annabel shared a look with him. Perhaps he was not so unlikeable as she’d first thought.
“Behind you!”
She was already on it. Without turning away or letting go of the scientist’s neck, she pivoted, raised her arm, and took hold of a man’s wrist. She bent her knees and using his momentum against him, flipped the man over her back. He was surprisingly heavy. The only thing that allowed her to manage the feat was his own momentum. She sent him sprawling, grunting with the effort as her corset dug into her chest and her skirt suffered an indecorous tear.
She heard him hit the ground hard, the wind knocked out of him, and turned to look at him. He was a giant, nearly eight feet tall by Annabel’s estimation. He began struggling to get up, but he was having difficulty. She might have broken one of his bones.
“Oops,” said Annabel, smiling wickedly.
“What?” said Dr. Simms, turning pale. “What is it?”
Sinews began to laugh. Either he’d guessed or he’d seen what had happened. He covered his mouth with his hand in an effort to disguise his joy.
“Splendid,” he cried.
“What?” Dr. Simms said again.
“It seems I’ve given you an injection of my own blood, doctor. An excellent research opportunity, I have no doubt.”
At that, the doctor became hysterical.
“You bitch!” he shouted, repeating it again at a greater volume, jerking wildly in her grasp in a vain attempt to hit her. He was going to rouse the entire compound with his fit of verbigeration. She did the only thing she could think of.
She hit him. Hard.
He collapsed to the floor, unconscious. Meanwhile, the giant had managed to get to his feet. His height was even more impressive when he was standing upright, his head practically scraping the ceiling. Like so many of his comrades, he wore the black, leather plague mask. On him, it was even more intimidating. 
She raised her fists and prepared for the fight.
He moved slowly, grasping at her head with his giant mitts. She ducked to evade him, but underestimated his reach. He seized her by the head with one hand and squeezed. She felt like her head was going to explode.
Gasping in pain, she tried to hit him, but he was holding her at a distance, so she couldn’t reach him. She might have tried kicking him, but with her corset, she lacked the range of motion.
She blinked the pain away, grabbed him by the wrist, and twisted. The trick was to use his weight against him. All she needed was leverage, and -
He cried out in pain, twisting as she bent his arm.



Instead, he turned away and began hobbling down the hallway. No doubt he intended to sound the alarm. Annabel took off at a run.
She had nearly caught him when he darted through a doorway. The door slammed, and when she tried for the handle it was already locked. Mere moments passed before the alarm began to sound, a horridly loud klaxon sound that resonated throughout the compound.
She doubled back. She needed to get back to the elevator, but she hadn’t crossed this part of the compound on her way in.
“How do I get out of here?” she hissed at Mr. Sinews when she arrived back at his cell.
“I’ll get you out,” he said, “But first you’ll need to get me out.”
She nodded quickly. There was little time to argue with him. She’d spent her last dart, was unarmed, and who knew how many worked in this facility and what sort of security they had? She stepped back into her own cell, reached for the keys the unconscious scientist had dropped, and found them a moment later. A surprisingly difficult task, given the wardrobe requirements of her sex, but she managed it quickly enough.
She tried the keys in Mr. Sinews’ cell door. The first one failed to open it. She tried the next. When it too failed, she slid it along the key ring and tried the next one in line. Again, the lock refused to open. She spared a glance down the hallway. Still vacant, but surely she didn’t have much time. The alarm was unbearably loud. It had to be a matter of seconds before they converged upon her.
The lock refused to turn. One key after another until her attempts became more clumsy as she frantically eliminated each one.
“Try the next one,” Mr. Sinews urged.
She did so, and the key failed. Last one; if this one failed, she would have to make a choice. Either leave him here and navigate the complex alone and badly outnumbered, or attempt to pick the lock without her proper tools and risk being caught. 
She slid the key into the lock and without hesitation, turned it. The lock didn’t budge. She banged against the cell door in frustration.
“It’s no use,” she told him, “I’ve tried them all. I’m sorry.”
Mr. Sinews’ face became cold with rage, though Annabel could see that it was not directed at her. The swagger he seemed to possess, the nonchalance and sardonic smile melted into a sneer.
“Do me one last favour then,” he said, locking eyes with her and forcing a smile.
His eyes, they were so pale. A light shade of yellow that suddenly seemed, well, inhuman for lack of a better word. There was no time for this, she thought dully, but she found herself nodding.
“Anything,” she said dreamily.
“Draw back your sleeve,” he said.
It was strange. She wasn’t even sure his mouth had moved. His voice simply seemed to be inside her head. Ordinarily she would have gasped at the scandalous request, but now she complied, drawing back the fabric of her left sleeve to reveal her bare skin. She found that she was trembling. The klaxon sound of the alarm was drowned out by the palpitations of her heart.
He reached a hand through the bars of his cell door, took hold of her wrist, causing her to flush. He drew her arm inside his cell, bent his lips over her wrist, and bit into her arm.
She cried out, but it wasn’t entirely painful, and it wasn’t a cry of protest. It was startlingly pleasurable, even when his teeth broke the skin and her blood burst into his mouth. She felt her knees becoming weak as he drank, and though she was scandalized by his actions, she found that she was incapable of objecting.
Evidently Mr. Sinews was even more dangerous than she’d given him credit for, even in his imprisoned state.
“You’re not one of them, are you?” she said. “A zombie, I mean.”
He shook his head and licked the blood from his lips.
“Then you really are a vampire,” she whispered, still a bit delirious.
She stifled a giggle. Who would have thought her blood would be in such high demand?
“Just because I drink blood and daylight burns my skin doesn’t mean I’m a vampire.”
His mouth was still smeared with blood, and the smile was back on his face. He appeared flushed, and there was something different about his eyes. They were blue now, bright and vibrant.
“What’s the difference?” she asked, sobriety gradually returning to her.
“I’m not immortal, for one,” he replied, “And I certainly can’t turn into mist and slip out of my cell.”
She nodded. She was familiar enough with Dracula to grasp his meaning, though she’d never actually read it.
“I’m not allergic to garlic, either,” he said.
Well, at least he was back to his sardonic old self.
“Right.” Suddenly she remembered something. “Aren’t you concerned then? My blood is contaminated.”
He might have answered her, but suddenly she snapped back to reality. She had to flee. She turned away from Mr Sinews only to face another danger. She was practically surrounded by Resurrectionists, each now dressed in the crow-faced plague doctor masks and also outfitted with leather armour. Among them, the giant who’d sounded the alarm.
The man beside him stepped forward, holding off the rest with a gesture. His mask, distinct from the others only in that it was weathered and had obviously been well-worn, was familiar to Annabel. She’d seen it at Lord Connor’s masquerade, and should have recognised it then.
“Hello Annabel,” he said, his voice muffled but nonetheless familiar.
It had been familiar when she’d heard it at the masquerade, but she’d been unable to place the voice. It had been so long since she’d heard it, and frankly she hadn’t expected to ever see this man again.
“Hello, Jack,” she said. “Forgive me. You go by Anthony Tidkins these days, don’t you?”</Text>
            <Comments>I am surprised they did not take it too, considering she has a dart inside of it, but maybe the ones who took her were not privy to this information.
I guess they were not privy to this information!
Like a gas lamp?  Where is the gas being stored?  I would probably just indicate that she fiddled with the eye which turned on the light.  Indicating that gas is being used just brings up more questions for the reader.
as a “professional” thief, this makes sense; upon changing her to just a thief who steals for fun, change all instances of “clients” to “buyers”
Did this actually happen or are Annabel and Sinews messing with the doctor?  I would indicate this.

            <Text>Although the zombies of Newgate were locked in their cells, Roderick continued to proceed with caution. He peered into each windowed cell with the vague hope that the prisoner inside might still be alive, and each time, he was disappointed. He peered into face after face, and saw greyed and blackened flesh, tight, drawn skin, and hungry, dead eyes. Many of the creatures had fetid sores that leaked pus and thick, black blood.
Others had subtler signs of their symptoms — dry, flaking skin that could almost have passed for a sunburn, mild discoloration around the eyes, or stiffness in their movements. In these cases, it took Roderick a few moments to determine whether or not they were afflicted.
At each cell door, his anxiety continued to increase. It didn’t feel safe being among this many of the zombies, even with them in captivity. On one occasion, he peered into a cell and found it empty. He was about to open the door and have a look inside, when suddenly the horrid face of an unliving creature loomed in front of him, behind a pane of glass but only inches away. His heart pounded like mad, and Roderick’s breath caught in his throat. The creature must have been slumped against the door, just out of Roderick’s view. He shivered, suddenly feeling the cold of the stone floor on his bare feet.
“Let’s hurry up and get this over with,” he said, hand against his racing heart. “The sooner we find Sinews, the sooner we can get out of here.”
Taggert nodded in agreement, twirling his mustache, a nervous habit Roderick had caught him at often lately.
“When we find him—” Taggert began. He paused to check the next cell, and recoiled when he found its occupant. “Do you think he’ll still be alive? Or do you think this whole bloody prison is infected?”
“I’ve no idea,” Roderick said. “The virus can be distributed using infectious gas; we know that from the incident at Lord Connor’s. But we don’t know how far this gas is able to spread. Perhaps one of those mechanical birds was sent into the prision, or somewhere nearby. If this plague is airborne, even breathing is dangerous.”
“Then how do we know we won’t be infected just by being here?” Taggert asked, checking the next cell.
“We don’t,” Roderick replied. He sniffed. “And to be frank, we don’t know that your officers managed to get Sinews here safely. They might be digesting in the belly of a zombie as we speak. Or they might be zombies themselves, and be prowling the streets in search of human brains to consume.”
“Brains?” Hargrave repeated.
“Or kidneys, intestines, livers. I’m not sure the dead are picky eaters. Anyway, until we’ve checked every last cell, we won’t know for sure.”
“We could check the log book,” said Hargrave, as he took his turn to peer into another cell.
“Beg your pardon?” said Roderick.
“He’s right,” Taggert said, “The prison has records of its inmates. We can use that to determine where Mr. Sinews is being held.”
“Of course!” Roderick exclaimed, “I’m an idiot! Why didn’t I think of that? I suppose we’ll have to double back, then?”
Taggert nodded, and gestured for Roderick and Mr. Hargrave to follow him, as he took the lead this time.
“And don’t be too hard on yourself. You’re under a great deal of—”
He broke off suddenly, as he rounded the corner.
“Taggert?” Hargrave headed around the corner after him, then suddenly drew back.
“What is it?” asked Roderick.
“Back! Back!” cried Hargrave, turning around and urging Roderick to run.
Behind him, Roderick could now see Detective Inspector Taggert. He was pale, his eyes wide, his hand clamped on his throat. Roderick could see blood spilling out of it. Not half a moment later, the zombies leapt upon him with surprising agility, a speed brought on by the prospect of fresh blood.
They tore into him, tearing chunks of meat from his body, using only their teeth and fingernails. They bit into his flesh, teeth crunching sickeningly, and slurped up blood from his wounds until it stained their faces red. His intestines slopped onto the floor, steaming and hot. The zombies grabbed lengths of his intestines as if they were links of sausages, and bit into them, squirting hot juice into their mouths.
Taggert’s screams were pitiful, but there was nothing Roderick or Hargrave could do. If they didn’t run, they would be next. Hargrave had already pushed past Roderick, and was tearing down the hallway. Roderick sprinted after him. He spared a glance over his shoulder. Taggert was slumped over, either dead or passed out from the pain. For his sake, Roderick hoped he was dead.
Roderick raced after Hargrave, almost tripping over his own feet as he glanced over his shoulder and saw what the zombies had done to Inspector Taggert. He regained his balance, hands pounding against the wall to stop himself from falling. His lungs aching, heart pounding, he tore down the hall. His bare feet slapped against bare floor, echoed and reverberated against granite walls. Drowning out the sound of his footsteps and labored breathing, the zombies howled and moaned like starved wolves. The stench of rot filled Roderick’s lungs as he sucked in breath after breath of stale air, fear overcoming exhaustion as he tore down the long hallway.
Along the way, dead prisoners thrust their hands through the bars of their cells, grasping at Hargrave and Roderick. The ones that were out of their cells, some of them inmates, some of them prison staff, staggered after.
“This way,” Hargrave called, rounding a corner at the end of the hall.
He went up a flight of stairs, Roderick following as quickly as he could manage. His lungs burned, his mortal fear of exercise out-won by a more driving fear—that he would be eaten alive, or ravaged by cold, dead hands—or worse still, that he would be bitten and infected. The thought of becoming one of them was sickening. The thought of his rational mind turning to predatory instinct and the desire to eat human flesh. Desperate, his feet hammered up the staircase, up two flights of steps.
The snarling, slavering dead were only seconds behind him. If he stumbled now, they would have him in a moment. They were clumsy on the stairs. Some of them, their limbs stiffened by rigor mortis, staggered and fell. Those with flesh softened to mush by rot, limbs blackened and decaying, failed too. But the rest climbed over them, agile and quick, the infection still in its early stages. Roderick didn’t dare look back. All he could do was climb. Adrenaline and fear filled him with the energy to keep climbing.
As Roderick reached the top flight of steps, he caught sight of Hargrave, tearing down the hallway like the hounds of hell were after him. Roderick mounted the few final steps, zombies grasping at his heels, and panted for breath. Their clumsy swipes missed his ankles by inches at best.
He spun around, drawing his letter opener. The closest zombie was a prison guard, black veins running through grey and flaking skin, a crisp uniform spattered with blood. Roderick seized him by the shoulder for leverage, and thrust the letter opener into his jaw. The blade lodged in the guard’s skull, crunching through skin and bone with a sound like slicing a cantaloupe. He dislodged the letter opener, then shoved the dead guard backwards. He toppled down the stairs, taking several other zombies out with him, two hundred pounds of dead weight crashing down the stairs onto them.
But in that time, others had closed the gap. They lunged at Roderick, who stumbled back, desperate to avoid their rot-black fingers. He fell, landed flat on his ass. The letter opener clattered to the floor, out of reach. Terrified, he shoved himself backward, as the two closest zombies bit into the air where he’d been half a second earlier. Unshakeable, frenzied panic made him scramble back further. He kicked wildly at them without aim or precision, nothing but mortal terror.
This was it. This was how it would end. He felt their hands open his chest, and let out a whimper. His waistcoat ripped, and he felt them tearing at his shirtsleeves, trying to get at his arms. He blinked his eyes shut. If they were going to tear open his skin and pluck out his organs, he didn’t want to watch them do it. He screwed his eyes closed and braced himself.
Instead, there was a deafening bang.
His eyes snapped open. There was a spray of thick, gloppy blood, and the sound of a body hitting the floor. He smelled gunpowder. Another gunshot. Another body hit the floor. Roderick looked up and saw Hargrave standing over him, gun in hand.
No time to ask where he’d gotten it, he reached up and took Hargrave’s other hand. The policeman hauled him to his feet, fired another shot into the mob of zombies, and took off again, running.
Roderick didn’t waste a second, just took off again after Hargrave, thanking his lucky stars that Hargrave had come back for him. Ahead, Hargrave stumbled to a sudden stop. Roderick felt his heart stop.
The way ahead was cut off by a second group of zombies, this one even bigger than the mob at their back. Too many to go through. They couldn’t go forward, and they couldn’t turn back. There was nowhere to run.</Text>

            <Title>Scene Four</Title>
            <Text>There was a man with a bird’s face standing at the side of his bed. Behind him, a pale white boy with blonde hair, about his own age or perhaps a few years older, stood against the wall, looking shyly back. Jonathan offered up a smile, but the boy turned away from him, busying himself with his work. He had a jar of leeches in one hand and the doctor’s kit in the other. He set the jar down on the table beside the doctor.
He leaned back on his pillow and looked up at the man with the bird’s face. It was made of dark leather, and it was strapped to his head with shiny brass buckles. He had glass lenses for eyes. He’d seen pictures in books of doctors who would wear this style of mask in the times of the plague, but he never knew doctors still wore them.
He tried to sit up but the doctor pressed a gloved hand against his chest and forced him back down. He was cold, feverishly cold, beneath the blankets. He was sweating. The doctor had a thermometer in his hand. He placed it on the bedside table and turned back to Jonathan.
Jonathan wanted to ask him what was happening, but his own voice sounded strange to him. Incoherent. Slurred. He had a vague recollection of choking on something. The blood worm. He remembered gradually losing consciousness, and he remembered the frightened faces of his friends as they turned and ran.
He tried to sit up again, but was stopped once more by the doctor’s hand.
“Restrain him,” said the doctor. His voice sounded strange, too, filtered through the leather plague mask, but a moment later a servant entered the room with a set of leather straps in hand.
Forgetting that the doctor’s hand was still pressed hard against his chest, Jonathan tried again to sit up, and when he met the resistance of the doctor’s hand, he grew more desperate in his need to sit. He grabbed at the doctor’s hand with his own, tried to pry his arm from his chest, but he was like an ant trying to force an elephant to budge.
While the doctor pinned him down, the servant and the doctor’s assistant began to tie the straps around him, binding him to the bed. Three straps, one around his waist, one around his legs, and now the servant moved to tie one around his chest. He heard the sound of an animal snarling, and the girl stumbled back. She stared at him in alarm, her eyes wide and frightened, and it took him a moment to realise she was afraid of him. He hadn’t even realised he’d done it, but he was sure that sound had come from him. He wanted to kill her. No, he wanted to eat her.
She took a moment to catch her breath, and the blonde boy came up from behind as if to help her. She nearly jumped out of her skin.
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to-”
“It’s alright,” she said. “I’ve got it.”
She bent to buckle the straps in place. She moved in close to tie them up tight. She smelled like meat. He hadn’t realised how hungry he was, but the smell of her reminded him somehow of the smell of fresh meat. What was wrong with him?
Her hands worked quickly, and she was almost finished with the buckle. He wanted to kill her.
“Stay away from me,” he said, gritting his teeth. He had to warn them. They didn’t seem to realise the danger they were in.
“What’s that?” said the servant, bending down to hear him better. “Did you hear that? He just said something.”
Suddenly, Jonathan sat up. The doctor still had his hand on Jonathan’s forehead, but he was caught off guard by Jonathan’s sudden movement. He stumbled and lost his balance. Before he could stop himself, Jonathan sunk his teeth into the girl’s throat and clamped down. Blood spurted into his mouth as his teeth scraped through skin and tore out a chunk of meat from her neck.
She screamed, pressed down on her neck with both hands and stumbled about in confusion. She looked as if she might pass out. The doctor’s assistant, the pale blonde, let out a terrible scream of his own. Only the doctor seemed to keep his wits.
“Get a bandage, boy,” he instructed, “Stop the bleeding.”
Jonathan watched the scene impassively. He knew this girl might die, and he knew that it was his fault. He should feel guilty. But he had meat in his mouth, and it was warm and sweet.</Text>

            <Title>Scene 61</Title>
            <Text>Bailey yipped excitedly as Roderick unlocked the door and hurried inside. The small dog bounced on its hind legs and danced in circles, whining loudly. Roderick scooped him up and kissed his brow affectionately. He allowed the dog to lick his face, laughing as the dog’s soft tongue tickled his cheeks.
He ushered Miss Monday, Jonathan, Palmer, and Kip Lockwood inside. Kass followed right behind him. Roderick locked the door and gestured for everyone to make themselves at home.
“And don’t steal anything,” he added, for Miss Monday’s benefit. He winked, and added, “Jonathan, do keep an eye on her.”
Miss Monday grinned, and Roderick was relived to see she had a sense of humor.
Roderick, meanwhile, needed to let Bailey outside. Poor boy had been locked inside for far too long, and would need to go out to relieve himself. So while Roderick longed for a hot bath, he made do with splashing a bit of hot water on his face and applying a bit of lavender-scented soap to his filthy skin. He washed up quickly, and hurried to his bedroom for a change of clothes.
He dressed sensibly, choosing a smart pair of black and red striped trousers, a grey vest and shirt, and black cravat. He swapped blue for white gloves, and most importantly, he carried a cane. Not merely decorative and stylish, the cane doubled as a weapon. As any sensible gentleman in London knew, the city was a dangerous place to be without that most crucial accessory and a reasonable knowledge of the gentleman’s martial art, bartitsu. Roderick, being pragmatic, had also made a study of cannes de combat, and could disarm a vagrant of a knife without so much as sullying his shoes by stepping off the sidewalk. That generally left his would-be robber feeling quite silly for having made the attempt. On the off-chance that a blunt weapon would not suffice, the cane also contained a hidden sword. The curse of the artistically minded, of course, was a constantly wandering mind that often caused him to forget his street smarts. Thus he often left the house without his cane. Occasionally, without his shoes. Once, without his pants.
Not this time.
This time, Roderick had all his ducks in a row. His shoes upon his feet, his trousers on his legs, his cane in hand, and his dog on a leash, he turned to the door. He had his hand on it when the knock came.
He heard the distinctive click of dozens of guns, and saw that each of his houseguests had their arms raised to the door. They had taken the time to stock up on firearms and ammunition from Jonathan’s father’s gun collection before leaving the airship. Palmer had traded his shotgun for a carbine, owing to his injury. Kip Lockwood had a Webley revolver aimed at the door. Kass was squinting down the barrel of a shotgun. Jonathan still had Roderick’s flintlock revolver. As for Miss Monday, she had claimed a generous selection of weapons from Charles Grimmer’s collection. Her eyes had lit up at the sight of an ornately decorated crossbow, which she now aimed at the door. Of all things, a crossbow.
Roderick snorted.
“Put those down,” he said. “Zombies don’t knock.”
The knock came again, insistent and loud. Bailey yipped.
Roderick opened the door, feeling his guest’s guns still raised over his shoulder. A familiar, young, and devilishly attractive man stood in the doorway. Roderick opened his mouth and stammered.
“Roderick,” said the lad.
“Yes,” Roderick confirmed.
“You’ve forgotten, again, haven’t you?”
“My dear boy, of course I haven’t forgotten you,” he said. “I’m just surprised. It isn’t safe out there.”
“I had to see you.”
Roderick put a hand on the lad’s shoulder, smiling warmly.
“I’m glad you did,” he said. “Did you run into any trouble on the way here?”
“Nothing I couldn’t handle.”
Roderick smiled. He turned to the room. “You can lower your weapons,” he said. “This is Rémy Vaillancourt.”
“Salut,” said Rémy.
“Rémy models for me,” Roderick explained by way of introduction. And indeed, a number of the paintings mounted on Roderick’s walls were of the handsome youth. “Perhaps you might join my friends in the living room while I take Bailey for a quick jaunt? Miss Monday here was just regaling us with a story of her travels. Did you know this well-travelled lady has been to Haiti?”
Rémy put his hand on Roderick’s. “If it’s all the same to you, I’ll join you and Bailey.”
“My dear boy, I’d feel better if I knew you were safe inside,” Roderick told him.
Rémy sniffed. “I feel the same way about you. Do you know what I’ve been through to get to you?”
Roderick leaned in and kissed him until he felt silent. “Please,” said Roderick. “I’ll only be a minute. I have no intention of staying out there any longer than I have to.”
They shared another lingering kiss, and as Bailey whimpered impatiently, Rémy finally nodded. He headed into the living room, and took a seat beside Jonathan.
“Come along then, Bailey,” said Roderick.
“Shall I continue?” he heard Miss Monday say as he headed out the door.</Text>

            <Title>Scene Two</Title>
            <Text>The Dreadful was comprised of two parts. The gondola, which somewhat resembled a schooner, but with its sails unfurled beneath it. And the blimp, an enormous oblong shape that floated above the gondola.
The blimp had a dozen individual ballonets encased in a long canvas envelope, reinforced with a steel encasement that was grid-like in design. Like an overgrown ornithopter, it had huge leather wings attached to its sides—wings that looked like fins. It sported a tail at the rear like that of a whale, and it bore a sail mounted on its spine like a dorsal fin, so that it had the appearance of a flight-capable whale. The canvas that covered the ballonets had been painted over, the Grimmer Company’s name and logo removed so that only the the name of the ship remained. Written in a bright red font, Penny Dreadful.
Affixed to its underbelly were wooden beams and ropes which connected the inflated canvas whale to the ship’s gondola, which housed the passengers and crew.
The gondola had the appearance of a sailing vessel, complete with a steering wheel at its prow, and cannons along the gunwales; the cannons were new additions. Levers and gears, pistons and other mechanisms crisscrossed along the deck of the ship; most of these had been there previously, though Jonathan could scarcely guess at their functions. Meanwhile, there were newly mounted guns practically everywhere aboard the ship, and Jonathan knew exactly how those functioned. The gondola too had been newly painted, in a rich dark brown.
He had to crane his head to get a good look at the other new additions to the vessel, such was the Dreadful’s size.
Very little of the ship’s deck remained unused. Most of its vast space was occupied by the crew cabin, and the engineer’s cabin at the rear, both of which were enclosed.
Tall, wide windows lined the front of the cabin, as well as the bridge. There were portholes along the sides of the ship. The captain’s nook, at the helm of the ship, would face the open air, with only a railing along the sides to prevent the captain from falling. Of course, there were ropes that he could use to lash himself into place if flying at full speed. Or, if he preferred, the ship could also be operated almost entirely from within the safety of the ship’s bridge. Captain Merrick, however, preferred to fly topside, as Jonathan knew.
Beneath the ship were three retractable sails, which when used with proper sailing techniques, would provide both lift and power to the ship and carry it to great lengths and heights. The sails, which had formerly been white, had been switched with black sails.
But the highlight of the dirigible’s makeover was that both the gondola and the blimp were plated in armour.
“As you know, the ballonets are filled with hydrogen gas,” Manfred explains, “Which keeps it aloft and also maintains the structural integrity of the balloon. Therein lies the danger; hydrogen is of course extremely flammable, hence the armour. Just in case.”
“In case of what?” said Jonathan.
The butler suppressed a frown.
“I can’t stress enough just how flammable this gas is. The armour should provide some amount of protection from stray bullets, should you run into any trouble.”
“Bullets?” said Jonathan, suddenly alarmed. “Why should there be bullets?”
Manfred pursed his lips, apparently while he decided not to answer the question.
“If you’re taking heavy fire,” he continued, “Simply raise the safety shields. They’ll slow you down a bit, as the shields do prevent the use of the sails and wings, but I’m sure that’s preferable to going down in flames. I’ve already provided instructions to your crew.”
“Right,” said Jonathan. “My crew.”
His attention had been so focused on the ship that he’d failed to notice the assembly of crewmen, who stood by the airship, busily performing maintenance on the craft. He recognised Captain Merrick, and the young lad, Kippar Lockwood, whom he’d sent to the prison in search of Parson Sinews. Apparently the young man had returned from that duty, and was now immersed in putting the final touches on the Dreadful’s renovations.
“To what end has my dirigible been converted into a dreadnaught?” Jonathan asked, his awe giving way to annoyance.
“Your mother thought it would be a wise precaution. The Resurrectionists have an airship of their own.”
He fished a card from one of his pockets, and handed it to Jonathan.
“There will be a briefing, at this location.”
On the card, The Moirae Tea House was printed in bold. The tea house’s address was printed underneath.
“I see,” he said. “I have just one question.”
He gestured to the Penny Dreadful.
“Is she ready to fly?”
“Yes, sir.”</Text>

            <Title>Scene 47</Title>
            <Text>Annabel awoke in a cell. It was dark, cold, and windowless, a hard bench the only furniture. A set of iron doors locked her inside. She patted her dress, dug through her hidden pockets, and found that her lock picking tools were gone. Her guns had been confiscated as well. 
At least both her eyes were working. She might have expected to have had her prosthesis removed by her captors, so it was a relief that her vision was still entirely intact. She unstrapped the device, took the key from around her neck, and used it to wind up the mechanical eye. Before replacing it in its socket, she flipped open the hidden compartment. She had to suppress a grin. The poison dart was still there.
So, an eye for an eye, she thought. She’d put a dart in Dr. Jekyll’s neck as soon as she had a chance, see how he liked it.
She flipped the compartment shut and clicked her eye back in place with a click and a pneumatic hiss. There was an uncomfortable pressure in her skull as she fit the device into its socket, but she’d grown used to that over the years. As used to it as one could get anyway. She felt naked without the eye strapped in. Quickly, she fastened the straps, and experimentally rotated the lens.
She jumped back. There was someone in the cell next to her. A dark, shadowy figure in the blackness of the holding cell. He was watching her intently. Annabel shrunk away, squinting with her mechanical eye until it changed focus to reveal the man more clearly. She reached up and adjusted a dial. The device began to emit a dim light. She turned another knob, and her ordinary lens slid off to the side, making way for a green lens to slide into place, allowing her to see more sharply in the dim lighting. As she turned the wheel, she could finally see her fellow captive clearly.
He was astonishingly handsome, an unsettling smile upon his lips. A sardonic expression on his unblemished, youthful face. A piercing gaze in his eyes. His eyes were an unnaturally bright green, though this might have been owing to the tint of her lens.
“Sorry if I startled you,” he said.
“Not at all,” Annabel lied. She got to her feet and moved over to get a better look at him. Easier than squinting through her prosthetic eye.
“What is this place?” he asked.
She shook her head. She’d been hoping he could tell her.
“Resurrectionist holding cell, I believe,” she said.
“I suspected as much,” he said. “I was arrested, but the man who took me were not policemen. They mentioned transporting me to a more secure prison. Chateau d’If.”
Annabel frowned. She wondered if that’s what they planned for her as well. She was surprised the Resurrectionists hadn’t just killed her.
“Chateau d’If was the name of a fortress in the Mediterranean Sea, near the Old Port of Marseille. It later became a prison. It was used in Alexandre Dumas’ novel, The Count of Monte Cristo, as the apparently inescapable secret prison from which Edmond Dantes eventually escapes,” he said. He seemed to possess Annabel’s own ability to appear remarkably calm despite the duress of an unusual situation. She wondered if he felt as apprehensive as she did, in spite of his cool demeanor. “Unless we’re being escorted there in reality, which I doubt, I’d wager that Chateau d’If is being used as a code name for some other prison.”
His eyes never left her as he spoke.
“What do you know of these Resurrectionists?” he asked, suddenly changing the subject.
“I’m not sure I want to tell you,” she said, equally cold. “Who are you? What do they want with you?”
He edged closer to the end of his cell, and put his hands on the bars. The green glow in his eyes was even more pronounced with him standing close enough to touch her.
“I’m a hobbyist,” he said.
“A hobbyist?” she repeated, unimpressed. “Of what sort?”
“I follow the careers of dangerous criminals, collect broadsides and memorabilia, and visit the sites of their crimes. I try to meet these criminals, when I can.”
“An odd hobby.”
“But a popular one, believe it or not,” he countered. He placed his head against the bars. It seemed an effort to get closer to her. She took a cautious step backwards, and he grinned.
There was something about him, Annabel couldn’t quite place, but her instincts were drawn to his bright green eyes, his dark hair, and fair skin. She noted that he had the slightest hint of an Irish accent. She considered his “hobby,” and suddenly the puzzle pieces clicked into place. She knew who he was.
“You’re Parson Sinews,” Annabel said with surprise.
“You’ve heard of me?” He laughed. It was a cold sound, without mirth, and it unsettled her.
“We travel the same social circles,” she said. Annabel’s friends and associates were criminals, and Parson Sinews’ name was whispered on the tongues of thieves and murderers. It was a name that was feared even by the most hardened criminals. Sinews was infamous. He had influence, wealth, power. And he had a reputation. “I’m surprised we haven’t met till now.”
Sinews smiled. “As am I,” he said. He didn’t elaborate, but Annabel got the unnerving sense that Mr. Sinews knew who she was, somehow.
She hadn’t really trusted Mr. O, but she’d liked the man well enough. She trusted Mr. Sinews even less, and she didn’t think she particularly liked him either. But she was trapped in a cell, and he was interesting if not likable. And somehow, despite his imprisonment, he seemed to be enjoying himself. She said as much.
He grinned at the question. “No,” he said. “I’m not enjoying myself much. Imprisonment does not agree with me. That said, it is a pleasant surprise meeting you here. I never thought I’d have the opportunity to thank you in person. The Rembrandt is exquisite. I’ve set it on the wall in the sitting room, adjacent to the fireplace.”
It took some amount of effort for Annabel to keep a neutral expression. She remembered that particular heist well enough. As was her usual method, she’d made the arrangements through third parties, keeping the identity of her buyer and her own name anonymous. She never met her buyers personally, never learned their names. Using the alias Monday was a failsafe. She was a ghost. She should be untraceable. And she hadn’t introduced herself to Mr. Sinews. Seeing that he’d deduced it meant that either he was particularly clever or that her cover had again been blown by one of her sources. Until her recent encounter with the Resurrectionists, she would have considered the latter impossible. Now, she was not so sure.
“I’m glad to hear that, Mr. Sinews, but let’s keep the conversation to the Resurrectionists,” she said.
She wanted to say more, but she bit her lip. Sinews smiled that infuriating smile of his and shrunk back from the bars of his cell, and took a seat on the bench.
“Very well,” he said, threading his fingers together on his lap. “What do you know about them?”
“I don’t know how,” Annabel said, “But I know that they are connected to the Grimmer Company.”
Parson barely blinked at the revelation. But he was no longer smiling.
“This prison is in the basement of the Grimmer Company headquarters,” she said. “Last night, at Lord Henry Connor’s masquerade, I met a man called Mr. O. He hinted that Lord Connor was a Resurrectionist. I had been hired to rob Connor. After I retrieved the package, the Resurrectionists put a gun to my back and relieved me of it. Have you heard of the Lazarus Virus?”
“Yes,” Sinews answered.
“Well, that’s what was in the package,” she said. “They used a mechanical bird to spread the virus; in a matter of minutes, everyone in the house was infected. I was lucky enough to get out alive, as was Mr. O.”
Sinews winced, as if pained by Annabel’s news. It was the first sign she’d seen that Sinews was capable of real emotion. She cocked her head at him. “What is it?”
“My fiancée was at the masquerade,” he said. “You were there. Is there any chance she made it out alive?”
Annabel shook her head. “I’m sorry,” she said. “The only way she could have gotten away was if your fiancée was a Resurrectionist.”
Sinews said nothing, but he was grinding his teeth, jaw clenched. To Annabel’s astonishment, he seemed to be considering that possibility. Anything, she supposed, to keep the hope that his fiancée was still alive. He must have truly loved this woman, whoever she was.
Eventually, the drawn-out silence became uncomfortable. Annabel decided to fill the void in their conversation. “This man I met,” she continued. “Mr. O—”
“Jonathan Grimmer,” said Mr. Sinews.
“Does everyone know poor Mr. Grimmer’s identity?” said Annabel. “Alas, I don’t believe Mr. Grimmer is well suited for the cloak and dagger.”
“No indeed,” Mr. Sinews agreed. “Then again, it seems that you and I are not as adept at the clandestine as we’d like to think, either, given our current circumstances.”
Annabel shrugged. He had a point. “Anyway, the Grimmers are connected to the Resurrectionists. Yet somehow I don’t think Jonathan Grimmer is one of them. Call it a gut feeling, call it women’s intuition. Call it whatever you like, I believe Jonathan Grimmer is innocent.”
“I share your opinion,” Sinews told her. To her surprise, she was glad to hear that. She still didn’t know why exactly—perhaps it was because despite his naive innocence, he had stayed by her side at Connor’s, until she’d chosen to abandon him, or perhaps she was simply taken in by his handsome face—but she wanted to think the best of Mr. Grimmer.
“Still, he knows something about the Resurrectionists,” she said, “I came here to find out what. Instead, I ended up imprisoned here.”
“Well, if it’s any consolation, what Mr. Grimmer knows about the Resurrectionists, he learned from me.”
Annabel blinked in surprise.
“I told you I study criminals as a hobby,” he reminded her. “I spent some time investigating the Resurrection Man. Jonathan Grimmer came to me looking for answers. I don’t know the Grimmer Company’s part in all this, but I believe you’re right. Jonathan Grimmer is innocent.”</Text>
            <Comments>I am surprised they did not take it too, considering she has a dart inside of it, but maybe the ones who took her were not privy to this information.
I guess they were not privy to this information!</Comments>
            <Notes> She had to wonder, though. Jonathan had said that Mrs. Grimmer was working against the Resurrectionists from the inside. It was still possible that she was on their side. Still, she had no idea how far Mrs. Grimmer would go to maintain her cover. Surely she’d protect her son, but Annabel doubted the same courtesy would be extended to her.

Mr. O had said that he’d seen Mr. Sinews being placed under arrest by the police. Why then, was he in the Resurrectionists’ facility, and not in a regular prison? There were two possibilities that Annabel could think of. First, the Resurrectionists had impersonated the police in order to spirit him away. Second, there were Resurrectionists within Scotland Yard’s ranks.
“We share a mutual acquaintance,” she said. “Mr. O.”
“Ah,” he said with a smile. “The young Jonathan Grimmer.”
“Does everyone know poor Mr. Grimmer’s identity?” said Annabel. “Alas, I don’t believe Mr. Grimmer is well suited for the cloak and dagger.”
“No indeed,” Mr. Sinews agreed. “Then again, it seems that you and I are not as adept at the clandestine as we’d like to think either, given our current circumstances. Nevertheless, the three of us are wrapped up in this whether we like it or not.”
_
 But if he was expecting her to tell him more, he was to be disappointed. She changed the subject. “What do you know about …?”
“Once again, Miss Monday, you have me at a disadvantage.”
The name was used as a dig, a reminder that while Annabel knew about Anthony and the Lazarus Virus, he knew about her. She was tempted not to save her poisoned dart for Mrs. Grimmer’s throat. But she kept her anger in check. At least he didn’t know her as Annabel.
So she gave him a quick explanation of the virus, based on what Dr. Jekyll had told her about it and the creature she’d seen floating in the tank. She told him how the serum had apparently been used to influence the behaviour of Jack’s fellow Resurrectionists. She told him about Mrs. Grimmer, who was, according to Dr. Allen, not under the influence of the neurotoxin. She decided not to tell him that there was a possibility that Mrs. Grimmer was actually on their side.
“,” he said when she’d finished explaining. “.”
“,” Annabel told him.
Sinews frowned.
“I disagree,” he said stubbornly, but he offered no explanation. </Notes>

            <Title>Scene 62</Title>
            <Text>I was armed to the teeth and dressed in the most unusual outfit I could ever have imagined myself wearing. With Jack’s leather crow’s mask on my face, and his Icarus wings on my back, I must have looked like a human crow.
Most of my weapons were hidden beneath my skirts and shawl, except one: an old-fashioned small-sword, loaned to me by Dr. Karnstein.
I wore a pair of tall leather boots, but I was still careful to watch where I stepped as I traipsed through the bushes into the backyard of the colonial mansion of François Duvalier, the man known as Papa Doc. Apparently there were deadly snakes and poisonous spiders in this small island nation, and I was naively more terrified of both these dangers than I was of Papa Doc’s army of zombies.
I’d told Jack that I was not an assassin, but when Dr. Karnstein had explained the entirety of the situation, I felt that an exception might be in order. The female scientist wanted Duvalier gone because he had been speaking out against her research, turning the locals against her. She feared for her research, but she also feared for her life. If Papa Doc gave the word, she would be dead within the day.
But the situation was more complicated still than that.
These zombies of Papa Doc’s were not under his control, as he claimed they were. And they were not the usual sort of zombies, if such a thing exists. They were not created by the methods traditionally used by bokors. They were the product of a virus.
I didn’t know what the virus was called, then, but I believe I do now. Dr. Karnstein had been studying a virus that kills its victims quickly, causing them to rise after death. It was Lazarus, I am sure of it now, the same virus that plagues our city as we speak. Its victims would revive after death, and given to cannibalistic urges, would viciously attack any living thing that crossed their path, including their own loved ones. Even after they’d begun to rot, they would continue walking, hungry for living flesh.
A sample of the disease had been stolen from Dr. Karnstein’s laboratory. The evidence pointed to Papa Doc. I was to steal it back. And when my work was done, I was supposed to make certain that Papa Doc would never be able to steal it again.
With a gas lamp to light my way, I pushed through the thick vegetation and made my way into his garden. I only half believed what Dr. Karnstein had told me. I didn’t believe these men were truly dead, just sick. And I had no idea just how dangerous they were, despite what Jack and Dr. Karnstein had assured me. How could I believe that? It sounded like madness.
The yard itself was deserted and dark, but there were lights on inside the house, so I had to be careful not to pass in front of the windows. Cautiously picking my path, I navigated the floral garden and stepped beneath the veranda.
I dimmed the lamp and slowly I made my way toward the back door. Suddenly I heard a noise that startled me. Most of the noises here were foreign to me. The call of the birds were strange, and the chirps of the insects were alien, but the noise that startled me was strangely familiar. It sounded human.
But it was not human.
I directed my lamp at the source of the noise and spied a small building across the yard that I assumed was either a barn or a guest house. Checking to be sure that no one was coming, I abandoned the mansion and began to cross the yard toward the building.
As I drew closer, I began to make out the features of the building, and came to the conclusion that it was a barn. The noises that came from within also became more clear. Voices, I realized. They sounded like voices.
I approached the wide doors of the barn, raising my sword as I walked slowly through the tall grass. The voices became louder as I drew near, but they weren’t distinct enough to determine how many of them there were. Their voices all seemed to blend together until they just became a choir of muffled moans and coughs. Choking voices, hacking coughs, and sometimes wretched growls. The voices were strained and sickly, rough and phlegmy. Inhuman.
I set the gas lamp down on the ground so my hands would be free, then readying my sword, opened the door. The voices stopped in an instant as a hundred faces turned to look at me. The sudden silence was deafening.
Suddenly thinking better of my initial decision to put the lamp down, I hastily grasped for it and with one hand turned the dial, causing the lamp to brighten. Then I stepped inside and closed the door behind me.
The zombies stirred out of their temporary shock at seeing their prey walk straight into their den. All at once, they moved toward me. I was ready with my sword. I began to slash through them, cutting each one down as they approached with slow and rotten limbs.
Each face I sliced into was a man or a woman from the village, farmers mostly, fathers and wives, sons and daughters. All of them were dressed plainly, some wearing caps upon their heads, some bare-chested with thick muscles becoming atrophied post mortem. Their faces were emaciated, their eyes sunken into their heads.
They were slow, but they were many, and they were hungry. Soon, I had worked up a good sweat inside my crow’s head mask and bustle skirt. But I did not slow in my frenzied killing spree.
Left, right, behind me, I met them all with my sword. I was everywhere at once, cutting them down, creating a whirlwind of blood and body parts which rained down upon the floor of the barn.
Bodies piled up around me so that I barely had room to move any more. My arm began to ache, so I took advantage of my ambidexterity and switched hands, lifting the lamp above my head so I could not only hear them coming with their raspy breaths and ravenous growls but also see them approaching. See their hands twitch with excitement when they were ready to move in and attack.
I resisted the impulse to add my voice to the fray, instead swinging my sword in silence, with only a subtle breath of exertion. Finally, after what seemed like hour on end of slaughter, but what must in reality have been a matter of seconds, I had decimated the bulk of them.
A euphoric calm settled over me in the aftermath of violence. The settling of adrenaline, the calming of my rattled nerves.
Only one of Papa Doc’s zombies remained. Which was exactly how it was supposed to have gone. It was Jack’s idea that it should be one of Papa Doc’s own wretched creatures that executed him. Poetic justice. In my own naivety, I agreed, even laughed at the idea, horrifying though it seems to me now.
This one wretched creature, on its own in the darkest corner of the barn, quietly moved toward me. Somehow, though I’d just faced a hundred of these monstrous things, facing one alone felt different.
Looking into the eyes of a creature that once was human, and knowing that you must cut him down…
Even though I’d been told that this poor wretch was already dead, I didn’t know what to believe.
My heart began to hammer against my chest. The sweat within my mask turned cold. The creature met my eyes.
I’ll never forget those eyes. Pale, colorless orbs, set within a face that was little more than skin and bones. No wonder I faltered when—years later—I looked into Lord Connor’s eyes, and they were the same. No wonder these creatures still fill me with dread to this day.
The creature dragged its hands across the gore-slick floor and crawled its way to me. With no legs to walk upon, this wretched creature was persistent in its hunger. It dragged itself slowly, breathing through its nostrils, those pale eyes unblinking.
I set the lamp down on the ground and sheathed my sword. I reached out to take hold of him, careful not to let him bite me.
That was when I was seized from behind.
I whirled around to see one of those hideous wretches I thought I’d slain, grasping my ankle. The creature was pulling itself out from under the pile of corpses, and its grip was strong and unrelenting. I reached to draw my sword again; if it would not relinquish its grip, I would sever its arm from its body.
But I was grabbed again from behind, this time by the arm.
I yelped and pulled away, somehow managing to free myself from the creature’s grip, but I stumbled over the pile over corpses and fell. I landed in a mess of limbs softened by decay and wet with gore.
The stench in the barn was horrible, even through my mask, but it was worse amongst that pile of severed limbs and still-groping fingers.
I could hear them breathing. I felt the pile of corpses writhe.
In the throes of panic, I pushed myself back, away from the pile of corpses, even as they grabbed at me. I caught glimpses of their pale eyes, still looking at me. They grasped at me with renewed fervour. I pushed and kicked and shoved my way backward, away from the corpses, until I was free of them.
How many of these creatures had somehow survived their slaughter? I’d hacked off their limbs, slit their throats, or disemboweled every last one of them.
Only the ones whose faces I’d failed to cut through, whose eyes I’d not poked out—these were the ones whose bodies were still moving. Dr. Karnstein had warned me. She’d told me to destroy their brains. But I hadn’t grasped the importance of that point. I did now.
Suddenly, I heard the hiss of one of those creatures whispering in my ear. Its voice was cold on the back of my neck, so close I could feel it. I whirled around and screamed.
It was the creature with no legs. Suddenly, it reached out with its gnarled and yellowing fingernails and grabbed at my mask, tearing at the leather stitching. It dug in with its fingers in such a frenzy that against all odds, it managed to tear open a weak spot in the mask, even with its rotting muscles and flesh. 
And when it had torn a hole in the eye of the mask, it reached in and grasped my naked flesh as hard as it could with its atrophied muscles.
It gouged me with its sharp nails until it broke the skin and hot blood squirted from my face like the juice of a burst grape.
I screamed and screamed as my own blood rained down upon the zombie’s face. I felt warm blood run down my cheek. I felt sick.
At some point, I wasn’t sure when, I’d lost the vision in my right eye.
I felt a dull pain in my right arm, but I hardly noticed it. Something was biting me. Tearing through the fabric of my sleeve, chewing through my flesh. Biting down to the marrow.
I fought back, kicking and screaming.
Even as I struggled, I could still see that horrid creature raise its bloodied hands to its mouth and chew happily upon my severed eye.
I tore myself away from the hands that grasped me, tore my arm from the hungry jaws of a dead man. I felt faint. Dizzy. Nauseous.
I grasped for my blade. I struggled to my feet, caught my balance, and raised a hand to run the zombie through with my blade. I found I could barely lift the sword with that arm. Blood had soaked through my sleeve. There was no feeling in my arm. No pain. Just numbness.
I transferred the sword to my other arm and stabbed it through the zombie’s hideous face as it licked its lips.
I’d ceased being afraid now. Now I was furious.
I reached down and tore my eye from its jaws and held onto it as tightly as I could with my hand that had lost all feeling.
Turning back to the pile of corpses, I roughly grabbed each one that looked at me, beginning with the one that had ravaged my arm.
I pulled it from the pile and shoved my sword through its head. I continued in that manner until the bodies stopped twitching. All of them but one, anyway.
Dragging the severed upper body and head of the last remaining zombie with my one good arm, I pushed open the door of the barn. Stumbling dizzily, I hiked across the lawn toward the mansion.
Papa Doc and his servants must have become accustomed to strange noises coming from the barn, because no one had come outside to investigate. Or maybe they were all still asleep.
I revved the engine that powered the Icarus wings, pulled a cord to spread my wings, and levitated, off the ground, heading towards the upstairs window where Papa Doc was most likely sleeping. I can’t remember what happened next. I blacked out.</Text>
