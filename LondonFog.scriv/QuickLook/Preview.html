<p class="binderItem"><strong>The distinctive ringing of metal sang out as Kasumi</strong><br/>The distinctive ringing of metal sang out as Kasumi Hattori unsheathed her katana. She held her breath as she rounded the corner, keeping her footsteps as soft and light as she could manage. Her quarry was only a few paces ahead and had yet to notice her presence. With a layer of putrid blood caked on her face and slathered on her clothes, she was all but invisible to the creature she was pursuing.<br/>
In the near distance, somebody was crying out for help. The creature quickened its pace, staggerin...</p>

The command was echoed by the crewmen, who busied themselves with carrying out the task. The Penny Dreadful’s sails unfurled beneath its hulking gondola, catching the wind beneath the ship. Propellers whirred on all sides, while above, affixed to the steel beams that surrounded the blimp, vast wings of canvas spread and retracted. The sound of the ship’s wings beating like those of an enormous bird, the whir of the ship’s propellers, the mechanical cla...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Annabel Grey</strong><br/>Annabel Grey, better known by her alias, Miss Monday, had her arms full. In her left, a ring of keys to the cabins aboard the passenger steamboat Lady Bronte, and in the right, an enormous trunk that should have taken two men to carry. The passengers to whom the trunk belonged gaped at her as she lifted it easily and marched toward the end of the pier.<br/>
Annabel had traded in her Miss Monday finery for the dockyard scrubs she now sported. Dirty trousers, plain shirt stained with grease, the sleeve...</p>

“No sign of the thing yet,” he announced, turning back to face the gentlemen who’d assembled in the room.<br/>
Kip Lockwood, a member of the airship’s crew, who Jonathan had come to rely upon and to regard as a dear friend, was seated next to Dr. Sound, a bookish professor appointed by the Crown to serve aboard the airsh...</p>

The Mad Priest peered through the bars between their cells and watched the new prisoner sit abruptly and gasp for air as if he hadn’t been breathing. He sat there panting for a moment, sweating as he caught his breath. “It felt so real,” he said, trembling. “It felt so real.”<br/>
The Mad Priest tapped on the bars with his cane and saw a pair of green eyes flash in the darkness of the prisoner’s cell.<br/>
“I looked into Camille’s eyes,” the prisoner mumbled. “I...</p>

It flew low to the ground, and as it approached, Annabel began to make out details. The creature was not entirely organic. As with her mechanical arm and clockwork eye, metal fused with flesh to make a creature that was part machine, part animal. There were men sitting inside it behind thick panes of glass. There were portholes along the insect’s sides, like those on a su...</p>

They stared in silence at the beast as it approached Gravesend. The captain’s voice from the exterior of The Penny Dreadful broke the silence. Jonathan hurriedly made his way along the short hallway to the crew cabin, Kip and Dr. Sound following in his wake. They made their way through the cabin, barely causing the crewmen to turn their heads, busy as they were with their own work, and pushed open the...</p>

“Before you woke me,” he said, “I dreamt that Camille was dead. What do you make of that, Father? Wishful thinking?”<br/>
“Who is Camille?” Pieres asked.<br/>
“My fiance,” came the reply from the darkness. “It was her that dragged me to this hell on earth, you know. Resurrec...</p>

“Go,” she said, pointing at the wounded bodies on the pier. “Help them. I’m going to help them.”<br/>
She gestured to the airship in the sky. It was taking heavy fire from the insect ship. If she didn’t help them, they’d go up in flames. She wasn’t sure how she could help, but she had to try something. Bill no...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Recovered File [1123]</strong><br/>Jonathan watched in stunned silence as the beast’s limbs came crashing down on the ship. Shards of wood splintered. The world turned on its side. He caught sight of Worthington, slumped over, blood spilling from his mouth. There was a wooden beam through the man’s stomach. He heard the whoosh of escaping hydrogen, and clung to the railing as they began to go down.<br/>
“Empty the ballasts!” Merrick shouted, “Empty all of them!”<br/>
Torrents of water spilled down onto the streets below, and the ship slowe...</p>
