She held her breath as she rounded the corner, keeping her footsteps as soft and light as she could manage. Her quarry was only a few paces ahead and had yet to notice her presence. With a layer of putrid blood caked on her face and slathered on her clothes, she was all but invisible to the creature she was pursuing.<br/>

The passengers to whom the trunk belonged gaped at her as she lifted it easily and marched toward the end of the pier.<br/>
Annabel had traded in her Miss Monday finery for the dockyard scrubs she now sported. Dirty trousers, plain shirt stained with grease, the sleeve...</p>
