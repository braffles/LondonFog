She held her breath as she rounded the corner, keeping her footsteps as soft and light as she could manage. Her quarry was only a few paces ahead and had yet to notice her presence. With a layer of putrid blood caked on her face and slathered on her clothes, she was all but invisible to the creature she was pursuing.<br/>
In the near distance, somebody was crying out for help. The creature quickened its pace, staggerin...</p>

The command was echoed by the crewmen, who busied themselves with carrying out the task. The Penny Dreadful’s sails unfurled beneath its hulking gondola, catching the wind beneath the ship. Propellers whirred on all sides, while above, affixed to the steel beams that surrounded the blimp, vast wings of canvas spread and retracted. The sound of the ship’s wings beating like those of an enormous bird, the whir of the ship’s propellers, the mechanical cla...</p>

In her left, a ring of keys to the cabins aboard the passenger steamboat Lady Bronte, and in the right, an enormous trunk that should have taken two men to carry. The passengers to whom the trunk belonged gaped at her as she lifted it easily and marched toward the end of the pier.<br/>
Annabel had traded in her Miss Monday finery for the dockyard scrubs she now sported. Dirty trousers, plain shirt stained with grease, the sleeve...</p>

The Mad Priest heard the man in the next cell stirring. He peered through the bars between their cells and could make out a dimly lit figure jolting suddenly, as if waking from a nightmare. He heard the new prisoner gasp for air as if he hadn’t been breathing. The priest watched him sit there panting for a moment, catching his breath. “It felt so real,” the priest heard him muttering to himself. “It felt so real.”<br/>
The Mad Priest tapped on the bars with his cane and saw a pai...</p>

It flew low to the ground, and as it approached, Annabel began to make out details. The creature was not entirely organic. As with her mechanical arm and clockwork eye, metal fused with flesh to make a creature that was part machine, part animal. There were men sitting inside it behind thick panes of glass. There were portholes along the insect’s sides, like those on a sh...</p>

They stared in silence at the beast as it approached Gravesend. The captain’s voice from the exterior of The Penny Dreadful broke the silence. Jonathan hurriedly made his way along the short hallway to the crew cabin, Kip and Dr. Sound following in his wake. They made their way through the cabin, barely causing the crewmen to turn their heads, busy as they were with their own work, and pushed open the...</p>

The Mad Priest’s cellmate was talkative, which was both a blessing and a curse—a blessing because he’d been wanting for company, a curse because he was beginning to feel that Parson Sinews enjoyed talking simply to hear his own voice.<br/>
“Before you woke me,” he said, “I dreamt that Camille was dead. What do you make of that, Father? Wishful thinking?”<br/>
“Who is Camille?” Pieres asked.<br/>
“My fiancé,” came the reply from the darkness. “It was her that dragged me to this hell on eart...</p>

She raced down Crooked Lane, her feet slamming down on the uneven paving stones until her knees ached and her lungs burned. The anguished cries of the wounded still reached her as she rounded the corner. She didn’t dare slow down. Cannons boomed and the rapid fire of the insect ship’s machine guns.<br/>
Finally she reached the house she was lodging at. She pounded on the door with her right hand even as she fumbled to f...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Recovered File [1123]</strong><br/>Jonathan watched in stunned silence as the beast’s limbs came crashing down on the ship. Shards of wood splintered. The world turned on its side. He caught sight of Worthington, slumped over, blood spilling from his mouth. There was a wooden beam through the man’s stomach. He heard the whoosh of escaping hydrogen, and clung to the railing as they began to go down.<br/>
“Empty the ballasts!” Merrick shouted, “Empty all of them!”<br/>

Annabel rolled her eyes, including the one made of brass and glass, which rotated with a whir and a click. She did look different. Her hair was shorter than it had been last time she’d seen him. She caught Jonathan eying her tattooed bicep; that was new.<br/>

She listened attentively to Annabel’s plan, and set her jaw in a firm line when Annabel turned to Kas and explained her part.<br/>

The Mad Priest awoke from another strange dream, trembling violently with the memory. His head ached as if from a hangover. He was wasting away in this prison, all the meat on his bones turning to thin strips of skin that clung to his frail skeleton like wet rags. There were puncture wounds in his neck, but his memory had blanks. His skull throbbed when he tried to remember the night before. His prison mate terrified him, but he couldn’t say why.

“Run!” Roderick cried, scooping up Bailey in his arms and taking off at a sprint. Antoine followed, still hauling the suitcase behind him.<br/>
Roderick stopped to unhook Bailey’s collar and set the dog free. Then he snatched the suitcase from his assistant, opened it in one quick motion, and let...</p>
