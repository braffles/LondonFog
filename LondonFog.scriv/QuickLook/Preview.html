She held her breath as she rounded the corner, keeping her footsteps as soft and light as she could manage. Her quarry was only a few paces ahead and had yet to notice her presence. With a layer of putrid blood caked on her face and slathered on her clothes, she was all but invisible to the creature she was pursuing.<br/>
In the near distance, somebody was crying out for help. The creature quickened its pace, staggerin...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Hoist the sails!</strong><br/>“Unfurl the sails!” roared Captain Merrick.<br/>
The command was echoed by the crewmen, who busied themselves with carrying out the task. The Penny Dreadful’s sails unfurled beneath its hulking gondola, catching the wind beneath the ship. Propellers whirred on all sides, while above, affixed to the steel beams that surrounded the blimp, vast wings of canvas spread and retracted. The sound of the ship’s wings beating like those of an enormous bird, the whir of the ship’s propellers, the mechanical cla...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Annabel Grey</strong><br/>Annabel Grey, better known by her alias, Miss Monday, had her arms full. In her left, a ring of keys to the cabins aboard the passenger steamboat Lady Bronte, and in the right, an enormous trunk that should have taken two men to carry. The passengers to whom the trunk belonged gaped at her as she lifted it easily and marched toward the end of the pier.<br/>
Annabel had traded in her Miss Monday finery for the dockyard scrubs she now sported. Dirty trousers, plain shirt stained with grease, the sleeve...</p>

“No sign of the thing yet,” he announced, turning back to face the gentlemen who’d assembled in the room.<br/>
Kip Lockwood, a member of the airship’s crew, who Jonathan had come to rely upon and to regard as a dear friend, was seated next to Dr. Sound, a bookish professor appointed by the Crown to serve aboard the airsh...</p>

The sound of Parson Sinews’ leather shoes on cobblestone was louder than might have been expected from a man who walked with such grace and poise, an effect of reverberation. It was also an effect of perception, an auditory illusion caused by the relative loudness of footsteps against the otherwise still air.<br/>
There was a stillness in the air, interrupted only by the dance of shoes on stone, and with that stillness came the sensation that if Parson were to merely pause in his perambula...</p>

He sat there panting for a moment, sweating as he caught his breath. “It felt so real,” he said, trembling. “It felt so real.”<br/>
He’d looked into Camille’s eyes. He’d heard her voice, seen her lips moving, smelt her perfume. But Camille wasn’t dead. She was alive and well, and she had dragged him to this hell hole.<br/>
“Resurrectionist bitch,” he muttered.<br/>
“Are you awake?” said a voice.<br/>

It flew low to the ground, and as it approached, Annabel began to make out details. The creature was not entirely organic. As with her mechanical arm and clockwork eye, metal fused with flesh to make a creature that was part machine, part animal. There were men sitting inside it behind thick panes of glass. There were portholes along the insect’s sides, like those on a su...</p>

They stared in silence at the beast as it approached Gravesend. The captain’s voice from the exterior of The Penny Dreadful broke the silence. Jonathan hurriedly made his way along the short hallway to the crew cabin, Kip and Dr. Sound following in his wake. They made their way through the cabin, barely causing the crewmen to turn their heads, busy as they were with their own work, and pushed open the...</p>
